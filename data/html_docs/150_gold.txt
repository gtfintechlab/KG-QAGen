Subject to Section 2.25, if, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period:(a)the Supermajority Lenders determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that “Adjusted Term SOFR” cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof, and the Supermajority Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, or(b)the Supermajority Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a SOFR Loan or a conversion thereto or a continuation thereof that Adjusted Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making and maintaining such Loan, and the Supermajority Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.(c)Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to continue SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent (at the instruction of the Supermajority Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period.  Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.21.  Subject to Section 2.25, if the Supermajority Lenders determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that “Adjusted Term SOFR” cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any given day, the interest rate on Base Rate Loans shall be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of “Base Rate” until the Administrative Agent revokes such determination.2.18Pro Rata Treatment and Payments.   (a) Each borrowing by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of unused line fees or other fees, and any reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders, shall be made pro rata according to the respective Revolving Credit Percentages of the Lenders.  Each payment of interest in respect of the Loans and each payment in respect of fees payable hereunder shall be applied to the amounts of such obligations owing to the Lenders pro rata according to the respective amounts then due and owing to the Lenders.(b)[Reserved].44                                (c)Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of the Revolving Credit Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Loans then held by the Revolving Credit Lenders.  (d)The application of any payment of Loans (including optional and mandatory prepayments) shall be made, first, to Base Rate Loans and, second, to SOFR Loans.  Each payment of the Loans (except in the case of Revolving Credit Loans that are Base Rate Loans) shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the date of such payment on the amount paid.(e)All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the relevant Lenders (provided that payments of principal shall be deposited in the Loan Proceeds Account pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement), in Dollars and in immediately available funds.  Any payment made by the Borrower after 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on any Business Day shall be deemed to have been on the next following Business Day.  If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the SOFR Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.  If any payment on a SOFR Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.(f)Upon receipt of any payment (including any prepayment) of principal in accordance with this Agreement, the Administrative Agent will deposit the amount of such payment in the Loan Proceeds Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and shall update the Register and subaccount of each Lender to reflect its share of the proceeds of such payment. The Administrative Agent, the Fronting Lender and each other Revolving Credit Lender hereby acknowledge and agree that, other than to make a funding of Revolving Loans pursuant to a Withdrawal Request by the Administrative Agent, no withdrawals from the Loan Proceeds Account shall be made unless and until the Escrow Termination Date has occurred; provided that in the event that the amount on deposit in the Loan Proceeds Account exceeds the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Commitments at any time, each Revolving Credit Lenders shall have a right, by notice to the Administrative Agent (which may be a single notice delivered to the Administrative Agent by or on behalf of one or more Revolving Credit Lenders), to request the release of an amount from the Loan Proceeds Account equal to or less than the amount of such excess.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will deliver a Withdrawal Request to the Escrow Agent by no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the immediately succeeding Business Day following the receipt of notice from the Revolving Credit Lenders, which such Withdrawal Request shall request a withdrawal for disbursement to each Revolving Credit Lender an amount equal to its Revolving Credit Percentage of the amount so released. Upon receipt of such amount, the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute such payments to the Lender or Lenders entitled thereto.(g)Upon the occurrence of the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, any date on which the Loans have been accelerated, or any such earlier date on which the full amount of Revolving Credit Commitments have been terminated in accordance with the terms of this 45                                Agreement (including, without limitation, in each case, pursuant to Section 8 hereof)) (such date, an “Escrow Termination Date”), the Administrative Agent will deliver a Withdrawal Request to the Escrow Agent by no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the immediately succeeding Business Day following the Escrow Termination Date, which such Withdrawal Request shall request the withdrawal of the full amount on deposit in the Loan Proceeds Account for disbursement to each Revolving Credit Lender entitled thereto.  Upon receipt of such amount, the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute such payments to the Lender or Lenders entitled thereto.  None of the Loan Parties shall have (and each Loan Party hereby affirmatively waives) any ownership interest or right to withdraw, claim or assert any property interest in any funds on deposit in the Loan Proceeds Account.  (h)Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of payments on behalf of Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute such payments to the Lender or Lenders entitled thereto, in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent (provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, payments in respect of principal shall solely be deposited into the Loan Proceeds Account and shall remain on deposit therein in accordance with this Section 2.18).(i)If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.2.19Increased Costs.   If any Change in Law:(i)shall subject any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 2.20 and except for any Tax on the overall net income of such Lender) and any franchise Taxes (imposed in lieu of net income Taxes) and branch profits taxes and Other Taxes;(ii)impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including pursuant to regulations issued from time to time by the Federal Reserve Board for determining the maximum reserve requirement (including any emergency, special, supplemental or other marginal reserve requirement) with respect to eurocurrency funding (currently referred to 46                                as "Eurocurrency liabilities" in Regulation D)), special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender; or(iii)shall impose on such Lender any other condition (except for Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 2.20 and except for any Tax on the overall net income of such Lender) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender;and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Loans, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be liable for such compensation with respect to any such Lender if (x) the relevant change in law or other similar occurrence described in this paragraph occurs on a date prior to the date such Lender becomes a party hereto or (y) such Lender is not generally charging such amounts to similarly situated borrowers under comparable syndicated credit facilities that such Lender is a lender under and is entitled to charge such amounts to the borrower thereunder.  If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.(b)If any Lender shall have determined that any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender, or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such corporation’s capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such corporation’s policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be liable for such compensation with respect to any such Lender if (x) the relevant change in law or other similar occurrence described in this paragraph occurs on a date prior to the date such Lender becomes a party hereto or (y) such Lender is not generally charging such amounts to similarly situated borrowers under comparable syndicated credit facilities that such Lender is a lender under and is entitled to charge such amounts to the borrower thereunder.(c)A Lender shall be required to submit a certificate (i) setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section and (ii) certifying that such Lender is generally charging such amounts to similarly situated borrowers, and any such certificate submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof.47                                (d)Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender becomes aware of the occurrence of the event giving rise to such right to such amounts; provided further that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim is retroactive, then the 6-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.  The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.2.20Taxes.   (a) All payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Loan Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by or on behalf of the Borrower, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is a Non-Excluded Tax or Other Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) or (f) of this Section, (ii) that are U.S. federal withholding Taxes imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the time (A) such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (other than pursuant to an assignment request by the Borrower under Section 2.24) or (B) such Lender changes its lending office, except in each case either to the extent that such Lender’s assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts or such Lender was entitled to receive additional amounts immediately before it changed its lending office with respect to such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this paragraph (a)), or (iii) that are withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA.  (b)In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.(c)Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by the Borrower or any other Loan Party, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Lender the original or a certified copy of an official receipt showing payment thereof.  If the Borrower or any other Loan Party fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes (for the avoidance of doubt, not including any Non-Excluded Taxes for which Borrower would not be required to pay additional amounts to any Lender by reason of the proviso in the last sentence of Section 2.20(a)) or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or the Borrower fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes and any incremental Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.48                                (d)The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes (including Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Administrative Agent or Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Administrative Agent or Lender and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Non-Excluded Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(e)(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.20(e)(ii)(A)-(ii)(B) and Section 2.20(h) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.(ii)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,  (A)any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding Tax;(B)any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:(I)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and 49                                (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;(II)executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI;(III) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or(IV)to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, accompanied by Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;(iii)any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. (f)Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.(g)If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.20, it 50                                shall pay over such refund to Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.20 with respect to the Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This Section 2.20(g) shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person.(h)Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this Section 2.20(h), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.2.21Indemnity.  The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of SOFR Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of SOFR Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (c) the making of a prepayment or conversion of SOFR Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto or (d) the assignment of any SOFR Loan or Base Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.24(a).  Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank market.  A Lender shall be required to submit a certificate to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) (i) setting forth any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section and (ii) certifying that such 51                                Lender is generally charging such amounts to similarly situated borrowers, and any such certificate submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof.  This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.2.22Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain, or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest based upon SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower (through the Administrative Agent), (a) any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to continue SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to SOFR Loans, shall be suspended, and (b) the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of “Base Rate”, in each case until each affected Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all SOFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Required Lenders without reference to Adjusted Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.21.2.23Change of Lending Office.  Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.19, 2.20(a) or 2.22 with respect to such Lender, it will use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided, that no such designation shall be required unless such designation can be made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, (i) cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage and (ii) in the case of a designation arising from the operation of Section 2.19 or Section 2.20(a), such designation or assignment would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.19 or Section 2.20, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.19, 2.20 or 2.22.52                                2.24Replacement of Lenders under Certain Circumstances; Defaulting Lenders. (a)Replacement of Lenders.  The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.19 or 2.20 or gives a notice of illegality pursuant to Section 2.22, (b) becomes a Defaulting Lender, or (c) does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, modification, consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires the consent of each of the Lenders or each of the Lenders affected thereby (so long as the consent of the Required Lenders has been obtained), with a replacement financial institution; provided that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.23 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.19 or 2.20 or to eliminate the illegality referred to in such notice of illegality given pursuant to Section 2.22, (iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.21 (as though Section 2.21 were applicable) if any SOFR Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution, if not already a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein), (viii) the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 2.19 or 2.20, as the case may be, in respect of any period prior to the date on which such replacement shall be consummated, (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender, and (x) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.19 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.20, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter.  Each party hereto agrees that an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee, and that the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective.(b)[Reserved].(c)Defaulting Lenders.  (i)Defaulting Lender Adjustments.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:(A)Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and Supermajority Lenders and Section 10.1.(B)Defaulting Lender Waterfall.

Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  The Administrative Agent has the right to allocate amounts in the Loan Proceeds Account attributable to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with this Section 2.24(c)(i)(B) and deliver a Withdrawal Request to the Escrow Agent for the release and application of such amounts in accordance with Section 2.24(c)(i)(B), and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto and thereto.

The Borrower may terminate the unused amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment of any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender, upon prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof), and in such event the provisions of Section 2.24(c)(i)(B) will apply to all amounts thereafter paid by the Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity or other amounts); provided that (i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and (ii) such termination shall not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender.2.25Benchmark Replacement Settings.

Neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become subject to any withdrawal liability under ERISA that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect if the Borrower or any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this representation is made or deemed made.  4.14Investment Company Act; Other Regulations.  No Loan Party is an “investment company”, or a company “controlled” by an “investment company”, within the 59                                meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

Unless otherwise specifically set forth herein, the Collateral Agent shall have all the rights and benefits of the Administrative Agent set forth in this Agreement.  The Collateral Agent shall act as the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Collateral Agent to act as the agent of such Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties pursuant to the Security Documents to secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Collateral Agent, as “collateral agent” and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed pursuant to Section 9.2 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Section 9 and Section 10.5 (as though such co-agents, subagents and attorneys-in-fact were the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to enter into the other Loan Documents to which it is a party (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Representative Supplement) on terms reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, as applicable (it being understood that in the case of any Lien contemplated to be pari passu with the Liens securing the Obligations, the Intercreditor Agreement is deemed to be customary and acceptable) and to perform its obligations thereunder and to take such action and to exercise the powers, rights and remedies granted to it thereunder and with respect thereto.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Agent-Related Person shall (x) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender or Participant or prospective Lender or Participant is a Disqualified Institution or (y) have 92                                any liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or participation of Loans, or disclosure of confidential information, to any Disqualified Institution.Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by the final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein.  No Agent-Related Person shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any recital, statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the Security Documents, (v) the existence, value or sufficiency of any Collateral or the financial or other condition of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 5 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent, or (vii) to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof.Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be obliged to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities or the exercise of any right, power, authority or discretion if it has grounds for believing the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against, or security for, such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be responsible for any unsuitability, inadequacy, expiration or unfitness of any security interest created hereunder or pursuant to any other Loan Document nor shall it be obligated to make any investigation into, and shall be entitled to assume, the adequacy and fitness of any security interest created hereunder or pursuant to any other Loan Document.Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder or any other Loan Document arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its control, including, without limitation, strikes, work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware) services.9.4Reliance by the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent.  The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Loan Parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by 93                                the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless such Note shall have been transferred in accordance with Section 10.6 and all actions required by such Section in connection with such transfer shall have been taken.  The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or any other instructing group of Lenders specified by this Agreement) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or any other instructing group of Lenders specified by this Agreement), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.The Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent may at any time request instructions from the Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is permitted or desires to take or to grant, and the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  No Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the Direction of the Required Lenders.  The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders; provided that neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or in the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Laws.9.5Notice of Default.  No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default”.  In the event that the Administrative Agent shall receive such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or any other instructing group of Lenders specified by this Agreement); provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.94                                9.6Non-Reliance on the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and Other Lenders.  Each Lender expressly acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender.  Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates.  Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, none of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Agent-Related Person shall have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party that may come into the possession of any Agent-Related Person.9.7Indemnification.  Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each other Agent-Related Person in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Revolving Credit Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure Percentages immediately prior to such date), for, and to save the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each other Agent-Related Person harmless from and against, any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Agent-Related Person in any way relating to or arising out of, the Revolving Credit Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in its capacity as such; provided, further that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the Administrative Agent’s or the Collateral Agent’s (as applicable) gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, further, at no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be required by the Loan Documents) shall be deemed to constitute gross 95                                negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section 9.7.  In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Liabilities, this Section 9.7 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender or any other Person.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent upon demand for its Pro Rata Share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including all reasonable and documented fees, expenses and disbursements of any law firm or other external legal counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in connection with the preparation, syndication, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided that such reimbursement by the Lenders shall not affect the Borrower’s continuing reimbursement obligations with respect thereto; provided, further, that the failure of any Lender to indemnify or reimburse the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation in respect thereof.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender from any source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under this paragraph.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder and the resignation of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent.9.8Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity.  The Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and their affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent.  With respect to any Loans made or renewed by it, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, and the terms “Lender” and “Lenders” shall include such Agent in its individual capacity.9.9Successor Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent.  The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may resign as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, upon 10 days’ notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 8(a) or Section 8(f) with respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the term “Administrative Agent” or “Collateral Agent”, as the case may be, shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans.  If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, by the date that is 10 days following a retiring Administrative 96                                Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.  After the retiring Administrative Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s resignation as the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.9.10Authorization to Release Liens and Guarantees.  The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are hereby irrevocably authorized by each of the Lenders to effect any release of Liens or guarantee obligations contemplated by Section 10.15.9.11[Reserved].    9.12Withholding.  To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any withholding Tax applicable to such payment.  If the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason, or the Administrative Agent has paid over to the Internal Revenue Service applicable withholding Tax relating to a payment to a Lender but no deduction has been made from such payment, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with any and all expenses incurred, unless such amounts have been indemnified by any Loan Party or the relevant Lender.9.13Certain ERISA Matters.(a)Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent  and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, that at least one of the following is and will be true:(i)such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of 29 CFR § 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) of one or more Benefit Plans in connection with the Loans or the Revolving Credit Commitments,(ii)the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as PTE 84-14 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers), PTE 95-60 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTE 91-38 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds) or PTE 96-23 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performa

other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever incurred by an Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto or thereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) any Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds thereof, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of, or exposure to, any Materials of Environmental Concern, any failure to comply with Environmental Law or any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding pursuant to Environmental Law relating to any Materials of Environmental Concern related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any or of their respective properties, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, and whether or not such claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding are brought by the Borrower, its equity holders, affiliates, creditors or any other person and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the foregoing in this clause (b), collectively, the “Indemnified Liabilities”), provided, that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee with respect to Indemnified Liabilities (i) to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, (ii) arising from a material breach of such Indemnitee’s obligations hereunder, as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, nonappealable judgment or (iii) arising from any claim, actions, suits, inquiries, litigation, investigation or proceeding that does not involve an act or omission or the Borrower or any of its affiliates and that is brought by an Indemnitee against any other Indemnitee (other than any claim, actions, suits, inquiries, litigation, investigation or proceeding against the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in its capacity as such), and provided, further, this Section 10.5 shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes expressly referenced in this Section 10.5 or that represent losses or damages arising from non-Tax claim.  Each Indemnitee shall be obligated to refund or return any and all amounts paid by any Borrower pursuant to this Section 10.5 to such Indemnitee for any fees, expenses, or damages to the extent such Indemnitee is not entitled to payment of such amounts in accordance with the terms hereof.  The Borrower acknowledges that information and documents relating to the Facilities may be transmitted through a Platform, and, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, that neither the 104                                Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent is responsible for approving or vetting the representatives or contacts of any Lender that are added to any such Platform and that no Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the unauthorized use by others of information or documents occurring as a result of such information or documents being transmitted in such manner unless resulting from such Indemnitee’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, and neither the Borrower nor any Indemnitee shall be liable for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in connection with the Facilities.  The Borrower shall have the right to undertake, conduct and control through counsel of its own choosing (which counsel shall be acceptable to the applicable Indemnitee acting reasonably), the conduct and settlement of claims with respect to the related Indemnified Liabilities, and such Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Borrower in connection therewith; provided that the Borrower shall permit such Indemnitee to participate in such conduct and settlement through counsel chosen by such Indemnitee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Indemnitee shall have the right to employ its own counsel if such Indemnitee reasonably determines that (i) the Borrower’s counsel is not defending any claim or proceeding in a manner reasonably acceptable to such Indemnitee or (ii) the interest of the Borrower and such Indemnitee have become adverse in any such claim or cause of action, provided, however, that in any event, the Borrower shall only be liable for the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal expenses of one counsel for all such Indemnitees, taken as a whole.  If clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence is applicable, at the option of the applicable Indemnitee, its attorneys shall control the resolution of any such claim with respect to the related Indemnified Liabilities.  The Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of each Indemnitee affected thereby, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not such Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (a) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such action or claim, (b) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such Indemnitee and (c) does not require such Indemnitee to pay any form of consideration to any party or parties (including, without limitation, the payment of money) in connection therewith.  Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower agrees not to assert and to cause its Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby waives and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries so to waive, all rights for contribution or any other rights of recovery with respect to all claims, demands, penalties, fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses of whatever kind or nature, under or related to Environmental Laws, that any of them might have by statute or otherwise against any Indemnitee until all Obligations (other than indemnity obligations that survive the termination of this Agreement and for which no notice of a claim has been received by the Borrower as of such termination) have been paid in full and all Revolving Credit Commitments have terminated or expired.  All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than 30 days (x) after written demand thereof, in the case of any indemnification obligations and (y) in the case of reimbursement of costs and expenses, after receipt of an invoice relating thereto, setting forth such expenses in reasonable detail and together with backup documentation supporting such reimbursement requests. The agreements in this Section shall survive repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. This paragraph shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims or damages arising from any non-Tax claim.10.6Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments.  (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and all future holders of the Loans and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of 105                                its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Agreement.(a)Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks, financial institutions or other entities, in each case other than any Disqualified Institution (but only if the DQ List has been posted pursuant to Section 10.6(i)(iv)(A) hereof or otherwise provided to such Lender), a Defaulting Lender, a natural person or to any entity that such Lender has knowledge is a competitor (or an affiliate of a known competitor) of the Borrower or any Founding Member (each, a “Participant”) participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.  In the event of any such sale by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Loan for all purposes under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  In no event shall any Participant under any such participation have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, except that a Lender may agree with a Participant that it will not consent to any amendment, waiver or consent that would require the consent of all Lenders pursuant to Section 10.1 without the consent of such Participant.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, be deemed to have the right of setoff provided under Section 10.7(b) in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement, provided that, in purchasing such participating interest, such Participant shall be deemed to have agreed to share with the Lenders the proceeds thereof as provided in Section 10.7(a) as fully as if such Participant were a Lender hereunder.  The Borrower also agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of, and subject to the requirements of, Sections 2.19, 2.20, 2.21 and 2.23 with respect to its participation in the Revolving Credit Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to time as if such Participant were a Lender; provided that, in the case of Section 2.20, such Participant shall have complied with the requirements of said Section, and provided, further, that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to any such Section than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender to such Participant had no such transfer occurred, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts of (and stated interest on) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations and Section 1.163-5(b) of the proposed United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender 106                                shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.(b)Any Lender (an “Assignor”) may, in accordance with applicable law and upon written notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time and from time to time assign to any Lender or any Affiliate, Related Fund or Control Investment Affiliate thereof, in each case other than to any Disqualified Institution, a Defaulting Lender, a natural person or an entity that such Lender has knowledge is a is a competitor (or an affiliate of a known competitor) of the Borrower or any Founding Member or, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (it being understood that the Borrower shall have the right to waive its consent rights hereunder by notice to the Administrative Agent)), to an additional bank, financial institution or other entity (an “Assignee”) all or any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, substantially in the form of Exhibit F or any other form (including electronic records generated by the use of an electronic Platform) approved by the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders (an “Assignment and Acceptance”), executed by such Assignee and such Assignor (and, where the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent is required pursuant to the foregoing provisions, by the Borrower and such other Persons) and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording in the Register; provided that no such assignment to an Assignee (other than any Lender or any Affiliate or Related Fund thereof) shall be in an aggregate principal amount of less than $1,000,000 in the case of the assignment of any Revolving Credit Commitments (other than in the case of an assignment of all of a Lender’s interests under this Agreement), unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date determined pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder with Revolving Credit Commitments and/or Loans as set forth therein, and (y) the Assignor thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of an Assignor’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Assignor shall cease to be a party hereto, except as to Section 2.19, 2.20, 2.23 and 10.5 in respect of the period prior to such effective date).  Notwithstanding any provision of this Section, (i) the consent of the Borrower shall not be required for any assignment that occurs at any time when any Event of Default pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(f) shall have occurred and be continuing, and (ii) the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having received notice thereof.  For purposes of the minimum assignment amounts set forth in this paragraph, multiple assignments to or by two or more Related Funds shall be aggregated. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.6 (other than with respect to Disqualified Lenders), whether or not such assignment or transfer is reflected in the Register, shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section 10.6.(c)The Administrative Agent shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent on behalf of the Borrower, maintain at its address referred to in Section 10.2 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register (the “Register”) for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Revolving Credit Commitment of, and principal amount of the (and stated interest on) Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time.  The 107                                entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loans and any Notes evidencing such Loans recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement.  Any assignment of any Loan, whether or not evidenced by a Note, shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register (and each Note shall expressly so provide).  Any assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan evidenced by a Note shall be registered on the Register only upon surrender for registration of assignment or transfer of the Note evidencing such Loan, accompanied by a duly executed Assignment and Acceptance; thereupon, if requested by the designated Assignee, one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to such designated Assignee, and the old Notes shall be returned by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower marked “canceled”.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender (with respect to any entry relating to such Lender’s Loans) at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.(d)Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an Assignor and an Assignee (and, in any case where the consent of any other Person is required by Section 10.6(b), by each such other Person) together with payment to the Administrative Agent of a registration and processing fee of $3,500 (which registration and processing fee may only be waived or reduced in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent) (except that no such registration and processing fee shall be payable (y) in connection with an assignment by or to the Administrative Agent or (z) in the case of an Assignee which is an affiliate or Related Fund of a Lender or a Person under common management with a Lender), the Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Assignment and Acceptance and (ii) on the effective date determined pursuant thereto record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to the Borrower.  On or prior to such effective date, the Borrower, at its own expense, upon request and upon receipt by the Borrower of the old Notes (if any) for cancellation, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent (in exchange for the Revolving Credit Note of the assigning Lender) a new Revolving Credit Note to such Assignee in an amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment assumed or acquired by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the Assignor has retained a Revolving Credit Commitment, upon request, a new Revolving Credit Note to the Assignor in an amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment, retained by it hereunder.  Such new Note or Notes shall be dated the Closing Date and shall otherwise be in the form of the Note or Notes replaced thereby.(e)For avoidance of doubt, the parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the provisions of this Section concerning assignments of Loans and Notes relate only to absolute assignments and that such provisions do not prohibit assignments creating security interests in Loans and Notes, including, without limitation, any pledge or assignment by a Lender of any Loan or Note to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable law; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.(f)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a “Granting Lender”) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an “SPC”), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms 108                                hereof.  The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Revolving Credit Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender).  In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any state thereof.  In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.6(f), any SPC may (A) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender, or with the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) to any financial institutions providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans, and (B) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC; provided that non-public information with respect to the Borrower may be disclosed only with the Borrower’s consent which will not be unreasonably withheld.  In addition to the consent requirements set forth in Section 10.1, this paragraph (g) may not be amended without the written consent of any SPC with Loans outstanding at the time of such proposed amendment.(g)Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein, no Lender may, at any time, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments) to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof.(h) (i) No assignment or participation shall be made to any Person that was a Disqualified Institution as of the date (the “Trade Date”) on which the assigning Lender entered into a binding agreement to sell and assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to such Person (unless the Borrower has consented to such assignment in writing in its sole and absolute discretion, in which case such Person will not be considered a Disqualified Institution for the purpose of such assignment or participation).  For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any assignee that becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable Trade Date (including as a result of the delivery of a notice pursuant to, and/or the expiration of the notice period referred to in, the definition of “Disqualified Institution”), (x) such assignee shall not retroactively be disqualified from becoming a Lender and  (y) the execution by the Borrower of an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignee will not by itself result in such assignee no longer being considered a Disqualified Institution. Any assignment in violation of this clause (i)(i) shall not be void, but the other provisions of this clause (i) shall apply.(ii)If any assignment or participation is made to any Disqualified Institution without the Borrower’s prior written consent in violation of clause (i)(i) above, or if any Person becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable Trade Date, the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Institution and the Administrative Agent, (A) terminate any Revolving Credit Commitment of such Disqualified Institution and repay all obligations of the Borrower owing to such Disqualified Institution in connection with such Revolving Credit Commitment and/or (B) require such Disqualified Institution to assign, without recourse (in accordance with 109                                and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 10.6, all of its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Assignees at the lesser of (x) the principal amount thereof and (y) the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire such interests, rights and obligations of such Loans, in each case plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder.(iii)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Disqualified Institutions (A) will not (x) have the right to receive information, reports or other materials provided to Lenders by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, (y) attend or participate in meetings attended by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, or (z) access any electronic site established for the Lenders or confidential communications from counsel to or financial advisors of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders and (B) (x) for purposes of any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of, or any action under, and for the purpose of any direction to the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, each Disqualified Institution will be deemed to have consented in the same proportion as the Lenders that are not Disqualified Institutions consented to such matter, and (y) for purposes of voting on any Plan, each Disqualified Institution party hereto hereby agrees (1) not to vote on such Plan, (2) if such Disqualified Institution does vote on such Plan notwithstanding the restriction in the foregoing clause (1), such vote will be deemed not to be in good faith and shall be “designated” pursuant to Section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws), and such vote shall not be counted in determining whether the applicable class has accepted or rejected such Plan in accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws) and (3) not to contest any request by any party for a determination by the Bankruptcy Court (or other applicable court of competent jurisdiction) effectuating the foregoing clause (2).(iv)The Administrative Agent shall, and the Borrower hereby expressly authorizes the Administrative Agent, to (A) post the list of Disqualified Institutions provided by the Borrower and any updates thereto from time to time (collectively, the “DQ List”) on the Platform, including that portion of the Platform that is designated for “public side” Lenders and/or (B) provide the DQ List to each Lender requesting the same; provided that such Lender or potential Lender agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the DQ List (which agreement may be by way of a “click through” or other affirmative action on the part of the recipient to access the DQ List and acknowledge its confidentiality obligations in respect thereof); provided further that the Administrative Agent shall not disclose the DQ List to any Person without the express consent of the Borrower.   10.7Adjustments; Set-off.   (a) If any Lender (a “Benefitted Lender”) shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 8(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender’s Obligations, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other Lender’s Obligations, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of 110                                the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.(b)In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, to set off and appropriate and apply against any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower.  Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.10.8Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.  Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement or of a Lender Addendum by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.  A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.10.9Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.10.10Integration.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the entire agreement of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender relative to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents.10.11GOVERNING LAW.

Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any FC Credit Support. 10.22  Syndication. Following the Closing Date, the Borrower, each other Loan Party, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and certain Persons represented by the Specified Lender Advisors (the “Backstop Parties) shall be obligated to participate in a syndication process (the “Syndication”) for the assignment of a proportionate share of Loans and Revolving Credit Commitments in accordance with syndication procedures (the “Syndication Procedures”) acceptable to each of the Administrative Agent and the Backstop Parties (each in their sole discretion), in consultation with the Borrower, which Syndication Procedures shall be posted to the Platform.
