refinancing or replacing all or a portion of any pre-existing Indebtedness of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the person(s) or
assets to be acquired); <u>provided</u> that such Indebtedness satisfies one or more of the following requirements: (a) the release
of the proceeds thereof to the Company and its Subsidiaries is contingent upon the consummation of such Qualified Acquisition and, pending
such release, such proceeds are held in escrow (and, if the definitive agreement (or, in the case of a tender offer or similar transaction,
the definitive offer document) for such Qualified Acquisition is terminated prior to the consummation of such Qualified Acquisition or
if such Qualified Acquisition is otherwise not consummated by the date specified in the definitive documentation relating to such debt,
such proceeds shall be promptly applied to satisfy and discharge all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of such
Indebtedness); (b)  such Indebtedness contains a “special mandatory redemption” provision (or other similar provision)
or otherwise requires such Indebtedness to be redeemed or prepaid if such Qualified Acquisition is not consummated by the date specified
in the definitive documentation relating to such debt (and if the definitive agreement (or, in the case of a tender offer or similar transaction,
the definitive offer document) for such Qualified Acquisition is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the consummation of
such Qualified Acquisition or such Qualified Acquisition is otherwise not consummated by the date specified in the definitive documentation
relating to such Indebtedness, such debt is so redeemed or prepaid within 90 days of such termination or such specified date, as the case

for the relevant Qualified Acquisition is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the consummation thereof or such Qualified
Acquisition is otherwise not consummated by the date specified in the definitive documentation relating thereto, such Indebtedness shall

to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) each L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Lenders set forth
in this <u>Section 2.03</u>, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter
of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or in one or more Alternative Currencies under the Company
Sublimit for the account of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and to amend or extend Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance
with subsection (b) below, (2) to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit and (3) with respect to Acceptance Credits,
to create Bankers’ Acceptances in accordance with the terms thereof and hereof; and (B) the Lenders severally agree to participate
in Letters of Credit and Bankers’ Acceptances issued for the account of the Company or its Subsidiaries and any drawings thereunder;
<u>provided</u> that after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, (v) the Total Outstandings
shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments, (w) the Credit Exposure of any Lender shall not exceed such Lender’s Commitment,
(x) the Outstanding Amount of all Loans and L/C Obligations under the Company Sublimit shall not exceed the Company Sublimit then

Amount of the L/C Obligations under Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer shall not exceed such L/C Issuer’s L/C Issuer Sublimit.
Each request by the Company for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by the Company
that the L/C Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Within the
foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company’s ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully
revolving, and accordingly the Company may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have
expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant hereto,
and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and governed by the terms and conditions hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Barclays nor any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation under this <u>Section 2.03(a)(i)</u> to issue commercial
Letters of Credit or create Bankers’ Acceptances.</p>

All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense,
recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated
in an Alternative Currency, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent’s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds
not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers
hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent’s Office
in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates
specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under
this Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment
hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency
payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share
as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments received
by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified
by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding
Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by any Borrower shall come due on
a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected
in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.</p>

<u>Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent</u>. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender
prior to the proposed date of any Committed Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans or Alternative Currency Loans (or, in the case of any Committed
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Committed Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to
the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Committed Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has
made such share available on such date in accordance with <u>Section 2.02</u> (or, in the case of a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate
Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by <u>Section 2.02</u>) and may,
in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not
in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the
applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds
with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date
of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the applicable Overnight Rate,
plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing,
and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans, or in the case of
Alternative Currencies, in accordance with such market practice, in each case, as applicable. If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay
such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such
Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed
Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Committed Loan included in such Committed
Borrowing. Any payment by such Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have
failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.</p>

to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer hereunder
that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date
in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the
amount due. With respect to any payment that the Administrative Agent makes for the account of the Lenders or any L/C Issuer hereunder
as to which the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following
applies (such payment referred to as the “Rescindable Amount”): (1) the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such
payment; (2) the Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by such Borrower (whether or not then owed);
or (3) the Administrative agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable
L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed
to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed
to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.</p>

<b>Guaranty</b>. In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the Company and the Designated Borrowers, the Cash Management Banks
to enter into Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements and the Hedge Banks to enter into Guaranteed Hedge Agreements, the Guarantor hereby
absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt
payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter,
of any and all existing and future Obligations (other than any Excluded Swap Obligations of the Guarantor) of any Designated Borrower
to the Beneficiaries, in each case, now or hereafter made, incurred or created, whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated,
whether due or not due, and however arising under or in connection with the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents (including those
arising under successive borrowing transactions under the Credit Agreement and all renewals, extensions and modifications thereof and
all costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred by the Beneficiaries in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof
payable in accordance with, and to the extent provided in, <u>Section 10.04</u> of the Credit Agreement) and any Guaranteed Cash
Management Agreement or Guaranteed Hedge Agreement and whether recovery upon such Indebtedness and liabilities may be or hereafter becomes
unenforceable or shall be an allowed or disallowed claim under any proceeding or case commenced by or against the Guarantor or any Designated
Borrower under any Debtor Relief Law (collectively, the “<u>Guarantied Obligations</u>;” provided that for purposes of determining
the Guarantied Obligations, the definition of “Obligations” shall not create any Excluded Swap Obligations of the Guarantor).
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the Guarantor agrees that the Guarantor’s payment
of a portion, but not all, of the Guarantied Obligations shall in no way limit, affect, modify or abridge the Guarantor’s liability
for any portion of the Guarantied Obligations that has not been paid. The books and records of each Beneficiary showing the amount of
the Guarantied Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding and shall be binding upon the Guarantor and conclusive
for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guarantied Obligations absent manifest error. This Guaranty shall not be affected by
the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guarantied Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guarantied
Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any
fact or circumstance relating to the Guarantied Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Guarantor
under this Guaranty, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating
to any or all of the foregoing (in each case, other than a defense of payment and performance in full). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the liability of the Guarantor with respect to the Guarantied Obligations shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest
amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code
or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law.</font></p>

<b>No Setoff or Deductions; Taxes; Payments</b>. The Guarantor represents and warrants that it is organized and resident in the United
States. The Guarantor shall make all payments hereunder without setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of and without deduction for
any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, withholdings, compulsory loans, restrictions or conditions of any nature
now or hereafter imposed or levied by any jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or taxing or other authority therein unless
the Guarantor is compelled by law to make such deduction or withholding. If any such obligation (other than one arising with respect
to taxes based on or measured by the income or profits of any Beneficiary) is imposed upon the Guarantor with respect to any amount payable
by it hereunder, the Guarantor will pay to each Beneficiary, on the date on which such amount is due and payable hereunder, such additional
amount in Dollars as shall be necessary to enable such Beneficiary to receive the same net amount which such Beneficiary would have received
on such due date had no such obligation been imposed upon the Guarantor. The Guarantor will deliver promptly to each Beneficiary certificates
or other valid vouchers for all taxes or other charges deducted from or paid with respect to payments made by the Guarantor hereunder.
The obligations of the Guarantor under this section shall survive the payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations and termination of
this Guaranty. The obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any acts of any legislative body or Governmental Authority affecting
any Designated Borrower, including but not limited to, any restrictions on the conversion of currency or repatriation or control of funds
or any total or partial expropriation of any Designated Borrower’s property, or by economic, political, regulatory or other events
in the countries where any Designated Borrower is located.</font></p>

Guarantied Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take,
any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of the Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision,

liability of any Designated Borrower; (b) any defense based on any claim that the Guarantor’s obligations exceed or are more
