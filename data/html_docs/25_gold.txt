after the VAE and ninety (90) days after the VAE, 70% times the Assigned Value determined pursuant to clause (a)(i) above
and, thereafter for so long as such VAE continues to apply, zero (unless a valuation by a Valuation Agent has been obtained by
the Borrower, in which case, the Assigned Value shall be the product of (1) Determined Valuation of the underlying mortgaged property

(vii)which is comprised of any Borrowing Base Eligible Asset
that is not covered under clauses (i) through (vi) above and has experienced a VAE, for the first thirty (30) days
after the VAE, 75% times the Assigned Value determined pursuant to clause (a) above and, thereafter for so long as such
VAE continues to apply, zero (unless a valuation by a Valuation Agent has been obtained by the Borrower, in which case, the Assigned
Value shall be the product of (1) Determined Valuation of the underlying asset multiplied by (2) the loan to value ratio of such
Borrowing Base Eligible Asset as of its origination date).

that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this Section 2.3 shall control and govern.

Loan shall bear interest upon the unpaid principal balance thereof, from the date advanced or continued, at a rate, per annum,

A-2 payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns). Thereafter, the Loans
evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.1)

including) the date of repayment of such Loan (or the date of the payment of interest or fees or other payments, if applicable)
in accordance with the provisions hereof.
 
(b)          Anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement notwithstanding, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay, and the Agents shall not
be entitled to charge, collect, receive, reserve, or take interest (it being understood that interest shall be calculated as the
aggregate of all charges which constitute interest under applicable law that are contracted for, charged, reserved, received, or
paid) in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate. During any period of time in which the interest rates specified herein exceed the Highest
Lawful Rate, interest shall accrue and be payable at such Highest Lawful Rate; provided, however, that, if the interest
rate otherwise applicable hereunder declines below the Highest Lawful Rate, interest shall continue to accrue and be payable at
the Highest Lawful Rate (so long as there remains any unpaid principal with respect to the Loans) until the interest that has been
paid hereunder equals the amount of interest that would have been paid if interest had at all times accrued and been payable at
the applicable interest rates otherwise specified in this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 2.4, the term “applicable
law” shall mean that law in effect from time to time and applicable to this loan transaction which lawfully permits the charging
and collection of the highest permissible, lawful, non-usurious rate of interest on such loan transaction and this Agreement, including

for Borrowing.
 
(a)          Each

(b)          Each
Loan that is proposed to be made after the Closing Date shall be made upon written notice, by way of a Request for Borrowing, which
Request for Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall be given by mail, electronic mail (in a format bearing a copy of the signature(s)
required thereon), or personal service, and delivered to the Administrative Agent at the address provided in Exhibit 11.3,
by the Borrower giving the Administrative Agent notice at least ten (10) Business Days before the date the Loan is to be made,
and such notice shall specify that a Loan is requested and state the amount (subject to the provisions of this Article II).
 
(c)          If
the notice provided for in clause (b) of this Section 2.5 with respect to a Loan is received by the Administrative
Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (Eastern Time), on a Business Day, such day shall be treated as the first Business Day of the required
notice period. In any other event, such notice will be treated as having been received immediately before 1:00 p.m. (Eastern Time)
of the next Business Day and such day shall be treated as the first Business Day of the required notice period.
 
(d)          Promptly
after receipt of a Request for Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.5(b), the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders on
the same Business Day that the Administrative Agent receives such Request for Borrowing (or the next Business Day of such Request
for Borrowing is received after 1:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on such Business Day), by electronic mail (in a format bearing a copy
of the signature(s) required thereon) or other similar form of transmission, of the requested Loan. Each Lender shall make the
amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the requested Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available
funds, to Agent’s Account, not later than 1:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the Funding Date applicable thereto. After the Administrative
Agent’s receipt of all proceeds of such Loans, the Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds thereof available to the
Borrower on the applicable Funding Date by transferring to the Designated Account immediately available funds equal to the proceeds
that are requested by the Borrower to be sent to the Borrower in the applicable Request for Borrowing or apply such proceeds (after
deduction of any Lender Group Expenses) as directed by the Borrower.

the Administrative Agent receives written notice from a Lender, prior to 12:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the date of such Loan, that
such Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower
the amount of that Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Loan, the Administrative Agent may assume that each Lender has made or
will make such amount available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds on the Funding Date and the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding
amount. If and to the extent any Lender (other than the Administrative Agent) shall not have made its full amount available to
the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent in such circumstances has made available to
the Borrower such amount, that Lender shall on the Business Day following such Funding Date make such amount available to the Administrative
Agent, together with interest at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day during such period. A notice submitted by the Administrative
Agent to any Lender with respect to amounts owing under this subsection shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such amount
is so made available, such payment to the Administrative Agent shall constitute such Lender’s Loan on the date of such Loan
for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent on the Business Day following
the Funding Date, the Administrative Agent will notify Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by the Administrative
Agent, the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent for the Administrative Agent’s account, together with
interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Loan, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at
the time to the Loans composing such Loan, without in any way prejudicing the rights and remedies of the Borrower against the Defaulting
Lender.

(f)          Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 2.3(a)(ii), the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender
any payments made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the Defaulting Lender’s benefit or any Proceeds of Collateral
that would otherwise be remitted hereunder to the Defaulting Lender, and, in the absence of such transfer to the Defaulting Lender,
the Administrative Agent shall transfer any such payments (i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender
to the Administrative Agent hereunder, (ii) second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists),
to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this
Agreement, as determined by the Required Agents, (iii) third, if so determined by the Required Agents and the Borrower, to be held
in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations
with respect to Loans under this Agreement, (iv) fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of
any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting
Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement, (v) fifth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to
the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the
Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement,
and (vi) sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if
(x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded
its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 3.2 were satisfied
or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being
applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by the Lenders in accordance
with their Pro Rata Share. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or
held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.5(f) shall be deemed paid to and redirected
by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. Solely for the purposes of voting or consenting to matters
with respect to the Loan Documents (including the calculation of Pro Rata Share in connection therewith) and for the purpose of
calculating the fee payable under Section 2.9(b), such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a “Lender”
and such Lender’s Term Loan Commitment shall be deemed to be zero; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to
any of the matters governed by Sections 11.2(a) through (c). This Section shall remain effective with respect to
such Defaulting Lender until the earlier of (y) the date on which all of the non-Defaulting Lenders, the Required Agents and the
Borrower shall have waived, in writing, the application of this Section 2.5(f) to such Defaulting Lender, or (z) the date
on which such Defaulting Lender makes payment of all amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, pays to the Administrative
Agent all amounts owing by Defaulting Lender in respect of the amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, and, if requested
by the Required Agents, provides adequate assurance of its ability to perform its future obligations hereunder (on which earlier
date, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any remaining cash collateral held by the Collateral Agent
pursuant to Section 2.5(f)(ii) shall be released to the Borrower). The operation of this Section shall not be construed
to increase or otherwise affect the Term Loan Commitment of any Lender, if any, to relieve or excuse the performance by such Defaulting
Lender or any other Lender of its duties and obligations hereunder, or to relieve or excuse the performance by the Borrower of
its duties and obligations hereunder to the Agents or to the Lenders other than such Defaulting Lender. Any failure by any Defaulting
Lender to fund amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder shall constitute a material breach by such Defaulting Lender of
this Agreement and shall entitle the Borrower at its option, upon written notice to the Agents, to arrange for a substitute Lender
to assume the Term Loan Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, such substitute Lender to be reasonably acceptable to the Required
Agents. In connection with the arrangement of such a substitute Lender, the Defaulting Lender shall have no right to refuse to
be replaced hereunder, and agrees to execute and deliver a completed form of Assignment and Acceptance in favor of the substitute
Lender (and agrees that it shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such document if it fails to do so) subject only to being
repaid its share of the outstanding Obligations (including all interest, fees, and other amounts that may be due and payable in
respect thereof); provided, that any such assumption of the Term Loan Commitment of such Defaulting Lender shall not be
deemed to constitute a waiver of any of the Lender Groups’ or the Borrower’s rights or remedies against any such Defaulting
Lender arising out of or in relation to such failure to fund, including Borrower’s right to require Defaulting Lender to
reimburse the Borrower for any fees, charges or expenses incurred by the Borrower under this Section 2.5(f) as a result
of the failure by any Defaulting Lender to fund amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder. In the event of a direct conflict
between the priority provisions of this Section 2.5(f) and any other provision contained in this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and construed, to the fullest extent
possible, to be in concert with each other. In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid,
the terms and provisions of this Section 2.5(f) shall control and govern.
 
(g)          All
Loans shall be made by the Lenders contemporaneously and in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares. It is understood that (i) no
Lender shall be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Loan (or other extension
of credit) hereunder, nor shall any Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by any other
Lender to perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) no failure by any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder shall excuse
any other Lender from its obligations hereunder.

five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of a Borrowing Base Deficiency, the Borrower shall prepay the outstanding principal
amount of the Loans in an amount equal to the sum of (x) the aggregate amount necessary to eliminate such Borrowing Base Deficiency

Yield Maintenance Premium applicable to such prepayment.
 
(d)          Notwithstanding
anything else contained herein, no Yield Maintenance Premium shall be due on the voluntary prepayment of any Lender’s Loan

up indemnity with respect to any Taxes pursuant to Section 10.11 or compensate such Lender for any increased costs pursuant
to Section 2.11. Other than as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence and Section 2.8(b) above, Yield Maintenance

(f)          If
a Change of Control Event occurs, the Borrower will, at the Lenders’ option (as provided by Lenders in writing to Borrower

account and all interest, fees, and expenses (in each case, as and when payable hereunder or under the other Loan Documents).
The Administrative Agent shall render statements regarding the Loan Account to the Borrower, including principal, interest, fees,
and including an itemization of all expenses owing, and, subject to the entries in the Register, which shall be controlling absent
manifest error, such statements shall be conclusively presumed to be correct and accurate (absent manifest error) and constitute
an account stated between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent unless, within ninety (90) days after receipt thereof by the
Borrower, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent written objection thereto describing the error or errors contained
in any such statements.

2.11        Increased
Costs.
 
(a)          If
any change in, or the introduction, adoption, effectiveness, interpretation or reinterpretation or phase-in, in each case after
the date hereof, of any law or regulation, directive, guideline, decision or request (whether or not having the force of law) of
any court, central bank, regulator or other Governmental Authority (a “Regulatory Change”) affects the amount
of capital required to be maintained by any Lender and such Lender determines (in its good faith discretion) that the rate of return
on its capital as a consequence of the Loans or other advances of funds made by such Lender pursuant to this Agreement or any of
the Loan Documents relating to fundings or commitments under this Agreement is reduced to a level below that which such Lender
would have achieved but for the occurrence of any such circumstance, then, in any such case within thirty (30) days after written
notice (which may be by email) from time to time by such Lender to the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender compensation
sufficient to compensate such Lender for such reduction in rate of return; provided, that such Lender shall provide the
Borrower with such notice within a reasonable period of time following such Lender’s discovery of such increased costs or
reductions. A statement of such Lender as to any such additional amount or amounts (including calculations thereof in reasonable
detail), in the absence of manifest error, shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and such Lender. Notwithstanding the
forgoing, (a) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder
or issued in connection therewith, and (b) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International
Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign
Governmental Authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall, in the case of clause (a) and clause (b), be
deemed to be introduced, adopted, implemented and/or effective after the date hereof (regardless of the date enacted, adopted,
issued, implemented and/or effective). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.11(a), the Borrower shall
not be required to compensate any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.11(a) for any amounts incurred more than nine months
prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided
that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such nine month period shall be extended to
include the period of such retroactive effect.
 
(b)          If
any Change in Law shall:
 
(i) impose, modify or
deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits

(ii) subject any Recipient
to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded
Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its
deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
 
(iii) impose on any Lender
any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any participation
therein;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing
shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan
or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender
or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or other Recipient,
the Borrower will pay to such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

institution or (any such other bank or other financial institution being called an “Additional Lender”) (each
such existing Lender or Additional Lender providing such, an “Incremental Lender”); provided that (i)
Borrower shall only be permitted to request all or a portion (as applicable) of the Term Loan Increase from Additional Lenders
if the Borrower has offered each of the existing Lenders an opportunity to provide such Term Loan Increase and the existing Lenders
have declined to provide all or a portion of the Term Loan Increase (or have not responded in writing to the Borrower within ten
(10) Business Days of any such offer) and (ii) for so long as any of the Required Lenders are managed or advised by J.P. Morgan

giving effect to such Incremental Term Commitments, the conditions of Section 3.2(a) shall be satisfied (it being understood

effective date of such Incremental Amendment); provided that, if the proceeds of any Incremental Term Commitments are being
used to finance an acquisition permitted hereunder, (x) the reference in Section 3.2(a) to the accuracy of the representations
and warranties shall refer to the accuracy of the representations and warranties that would constitute “specified representations”
and the representations and warranties in the relevant acquisition agreement, the breach of which would permit the buyer to terminate
its obligations thereunder or decline to consummate such acquisition and (y) the reference to “Material Adverse Effect”
in the “specified representations” shall be understood for this purpose to refer to “Material Adverse Effect”
or similar definition as defined in the main transaction agreement governing such acquisition permitted hereunder;

extent otherwise permitted under this Section 2.15, (y) to the extent more restrictive on the Borrower or the Guarantors

proceeds, if any of the Incremental Term Loans, will be used for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
including, without limitation, for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and other permitted investments, restricted payments,

Amendment.

the reasonable opinion of the Agents and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.15.

Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Agents to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the

in connection with the establishment of such new Loans, in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.15, including

Incremental Term Loans to be fungible for United States federal income tax purposes with the Initial Term Loans, which shall include

of Obligations. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.11,

Lender pursuant to Section 10.11, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different one of its lending
offices or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if (i) in the reasonable
judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.11
or 10.11, as applicable, and (ii) in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment would not
subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such
Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.
 
2.17        Pro
Rata Treatment.
 
(a)          Each
Loan shall be allocated among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share.
 
(b)          Except

the Initial Term Loans and each payment in respect of fees or expenses payable hereunder shall be applied to the amounts of such
obligations owing to the Lenders entitled thereto in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share. Each voluntary prepayment
by the Borrower of Initial Term Loans shall be applied to the amounts of such obligations owing to the Lenders in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Share (unless such payment is made in accordance with Section 9.1(f), in which case it shall be
made in accordance with such Section).

2.8(d) (if any). Upon the delivery of the Cash Cure Amount to the Borrower prior to the Cure Expiration Date, any Event of
Default that has occurred pursuant to Section 6.12 shall be deemed to not have occurred and, for the avoidance of doubt,
neither any Agent nor any Lender shall exercise the right to accelerate the Loans and none of any Agent, any Lender or any Secured
Party shall exercise any right to foreclose on or take possession of the Collateral or exercise any other remedy pursuant to Section
7.2, the other Loan Documents or applicable law prior to the Cure Expiration Date solely on the basis of an Event of Default
having occurred and continuing under Section 6.12 (except to the extent that the Borrower has confirmed that in writing
that it does not intend to provide a Cash Cure Amount). For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall not be able to obtain any
Loan hereunder until receipt by the Agents of the Cash Cure Amount; and
 
(b)          Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Borrower shall (to the extent capable of cure) have five (5) Business Days to cure any event
that would give rise to a reduction in value of any Borrowing Base Eligible Asset, including, for the avoidance of doubt, a VAE
and any event described in Section 11.5.

to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) any dispute solely among
Indemnitees (other than any claims against an Indemnitee in its capacity or in fulfilling its role as an agent or arranger or
any similar role hereunder or under any other Loan Document and other than any claims arising out of any act or omission of the
Borrower). The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 8.2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the

case with respect to any Credit Facility) any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
 
(i)          Minimum

(which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal
outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment
and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000, unless

rata basis.
 

 - 75 - 
 

 
(iii)        Required
Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by Section 9.1(b)(i) and, in
addition: (A) the written consent of the Borrower shall be required (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld
or delayed); provided that, no consent of the Borrower shall be required (x) in the event a Default (after expiry of any
grace, cure and notice periods or as further extended with the approval of the Required Lenders) or an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (y) if such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved
Fund; provided, further, that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall
object thereto by written notice to the Agents within ten (10) Business Days after having received written notice thereof (which
notice shall provide, in bold type face, that if the Borrower does not object in writing to such assignment within ten (10) Business
Days, the Borrower’s consent shall have been deemed to have been provided) and (B) the consent of the Agents (such consent
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of any Loans to a Person who is not a Lender,
an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.
 
(iv)        Assignment

to the Agents an Administrative Questionnaire, a duly executed IRS Form W-9, or such other IRS Form as applicable, and all “know
your customer” documentation requested by the Administrative Agent.
 
(v)         No
Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or
Subsidiaries except as permitted by Section 9.1(f).
 
(vi)        Certain
Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such
assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the
assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution
thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other
compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Required Agents, the applicable pro rata share
of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby
irrevocably consent), to pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Agents and
each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), in accordance with its applicable percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable
law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting
Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
 

 - 76 - 
 

 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof
by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.1(c), and receipt of all requirements under Section 9.1(b)(iv)
by the Administrative Agent, from and after the Administrative Agent has recorded such Assignment and Acceptance in the Register,
the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,
have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of
an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender
shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.11, Section 8.1
and Section 8.2 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided,
that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute
a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender. Any assignment
or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated
for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section
9.1(d).
 
(c)          Register.
The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its
offices in Chicago, Illinois a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the
names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to,
each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall
be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name
is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register
shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
prior written notice.
 
(d)          Participations.
 
(i)        Any
Lender may at any time, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle
or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person, or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s
Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that
(i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible
to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and Lenders
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under
this Agreement.
 

 - 77 - 
 

 
(ii)         Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole
right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver described in Sections 11.2(a)-(i) that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.11, 2.16 and 10.11 (subject to the requirements and limitations
therein, including the requirements under Section 10.11 (it being understood that the documentation required under Section
10.11 shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest
by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the
provisions of Section 2.16 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled
to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.11 or 10.11, with respect to any participation, than its participating
Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change
in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant
also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.13 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant
agrees to be subject to Section 10.13 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely
for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each
Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations
under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation
to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating
to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document)
to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit
or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the
Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded
in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to
the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility
for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
(iii)        No
consent shall be required for any participation except that the consent of the Borrower shall be required (such consent not to
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed); provided that, no consent of the Borrower shall be required (x) in the
event a Default (after expiry of any grace, cure and notice periods or as further extended with the approval of the Required Lenders)
or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such participation or (y) if such participation is to a Lender,
an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided, further, that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented
to any such participation unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Agents within ten (10) Business Days after having
received written notice thereof (which notice shall provide, in bold type face, that if the Borrower does not object in writing
to such participation within ten (10) Business Days, the Borrower’s consent shall have been deemed to have been provided).
 
(e)          Certain
Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement
to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee
or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(f)           Assignments
to Borrower and Borrower Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Lender may, at any time,
assign all or a portion of its Loans on a pro rata basis to the Borrower or any Borrower Affiliate, subject to the following limitations:
 

 - 78 - 
 

 
(i)          immediately
and automatically, without any further action on the part of the Borrower, any Lender, any Agent or any other Person, upon the
effectiveness of such assignment of Loans from a Lender to the Borrower, such Loans and all rights and obligations as a Lender
related thereto shall, for all purposes under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and otherwise, be deemed to be irrevocably
prepaid, terminated, extinguished, cancelled and of no further force and effect (and which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments for purposes of Section 2.8 hereof) and the Borrower shall neither
obtain nor have any rights as a Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents by virtue of such assignment such purchases
(and the payments made by the Borrower and the cancellation of the purchased Loans, in each case in connection therewith);
 
(ii)         any
Borrower Affiliate may, with the consent of the Borrower, including without limitation, in exchange for Debt or Securities permitted
to be issued, contribute, directly or indirectly, the principal amount of such Loans or any portion thereof, plus all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, to the Borrower for the purpose of cancelling and extinguishing such Loans; provided that, upon
the date of such contribution, assignment or transfer, (x) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Loans shall reflect such
cancellation and extinguishing of the Loans then held by the Borrower and (y) the Borrower shall promptly provide written notice
to the Agents of such contribution of such Loans, and the Administrative Agent, upon receipt of such notice, shall reflect the
cancellation of the applicable Loans in the Register;
 
(iii)        (A)
for purposes of any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of, or any action under, and for the purpose of any direction
to any Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) under, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, each applicable Borrower Affiliate will be deemed to have consented in the same proportion as the Lenders that are not
Borrower Affiliate consented to such matter, unless such matter requires the consent of all or all affected Lenders and adversely
affects such Borrower Affiliate more than other Lenders in any material respect, (B) for purposes of voting on any plan of reorganization
or plan of liquidation pursuant to any Debtor Relief Laws (a “Bankruptcy Plan”), each Borrower Affiliate hereby
agrees (x) not to vote on such Bankruptcy Plan, (y) if such Borrower Affiliate does vote on such Bankruptcy Plan notwithstanding
the restriction in the foregoing clause (x), such vote will be deemed not to be in good faith and shall be “designated”
pursuant to Section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws), and such vote shall
not be counted in determining whether the applicable class has accepted or rejected such Bankruptcy Plan in accordance with Section 1126(c)
of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws) and (z) not to contest any request by any party
for a determination by a court of competent jurisdiction effectuating the foregoing clause (y), in each case under this
clause (B) unless such Bankruptcy Plan adversely affects such Borrower Affiliate more than other Lenders in any material
respect and (C) each Borrower Affiliate hereby irrevocably appoints the Agents (such appointment being coupled with an interest)
as such Borrower Affiliate’s attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Borrower Affiliate and
in the name of such Borrower Affiliate (solely in respect of Loans held by such Borrower Affiliate and not in respect of any other
claim or status such Borrower Affiliate may otherwise have), from time to time in either Agent’s discretion to take any action
and to execute any instrument that the Agents may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this
Section 9.1(f)(iv), including to ensure that any vote of such Borrower Affiliate on any Bankruptcy Plan is withdrawn or
otherwise not counted;
 

 - 79 - 
 

 
(iv)        the
Borrower and any Borrower Affiliate shall represent and warrant, on the date of any such assignment, that neither it, its Affiliates
nor any of its respective directors or officers has any Excluded Information that has not been disclosed to the Lenders generally
(other than to the extent any such Lender does not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to the Borrower
or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective securities) prior to such date;
 
(v)         all
parties to the relevant transactions shall render customary “big boy” disclaimer letters; and
 
(vi)        no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing before or immediately after giving effect to such assignment.

by Agent. The Agents shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless Agent shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Lenders
as it deems appropriate and until such instructions are received, the Agents shall act, or refrain from acting, as it deems advisable.
If an Agent so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability
and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agents shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with
a request or consent of the requisite Lenders and such request or consent and shall not be liable for any action taken or not
taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 

 - 82 - 
 

 
10.5         Knowledge
of Defaults/Events of Default. The Agents shall not be deemed to have knowledge
or notice of the occurrence of any Default and/or Event of Default, unless the Agents shall have received written notice from
a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice
is a “notice of default.” The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The
Agents shall take such action with respect to such Default and/or Event of Default in accordance with Article VII; provided
that, unless and until the Agents have received any such direction, the Agents (but shall not be obligated to) take any action,
or refrain from taking any action, with respect to such Default and/or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best
interest of the Lenders.
 
10.6         Credit
Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that none of the Agent-Related Persons has made
any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by any Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related
Person to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related
Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into
the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and any other
Person party to a Loan Document, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and
made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower. Each Lender also represents that it will,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and any other Person
party to a Loan Document. Except for notices, reports, and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders
by the Agents, the Agents shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower and
any other Person party to a Loan Document that may come into the possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

10.7         Costs
and Expenses; Indemnification. The Agents may incur and pay Lender Group Expenses
to the extent such Agent reasonably deems necessary or appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its functions, powers,
and obligations pursuant to the Loan Documents, including court costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses, fees and expenses of
financial accountants, advisors, consultants, and appraisers, costs of collection by outside collection agencies, auctioneer fees
and expenses, and costs of security guards or insurance premiums paid to maintain the Collateral, whether or not Borrower is obligated
to reimburse the Agents or Lenders for such expenses pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. The Agents are authorized and directed
to deduct and retain sufficient amounts from the Collections of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries received by the Agents to reimburse
the Agents for such out-of-pocket costs and expenses prior to the distribution of any amounts to Lenders. In the event the Agents
are not reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Borrower or from the Collections of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries received
by the Agents, each Lender hereby agrees that it is and shall be obligated to pay to or reimburse the Agents for the amount of
such Lender’s Pro Rata Share thereof. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall
indemnify upon demand the Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower and without limiting
the obligation of the Borrower to do so), according to their Pro Rata Shares, from and against, and the Lenders shall hold each
Agent-Related Person harmless from, any and all Indemnified Liabilities; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable
for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from such Person’s
gross negligence or willful misconduct nor shall any Lender be liable for the obligations of any Defaulting Lender in failing
to make a Loan or other extension of credit hereunder. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Agents
upon demand for such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of any costs or out of pocket expenses (including attorneys, accountants, advisors,
and consultants fees and expenses) incurred by any Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment, or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred
to herein, to the extent that any Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided,
however, that following the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, to the extent the Agents seek to take an
action which will cause them to incur a cost or expense in excess of $10,000, the Agents shall promptly seek prior written consent
of the Required Lenders with respect to such action. The undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations
hereunder and the resignation or replacement of any Agent.
 
10.8         Agent
in Individual Capacity. The Agents and their Affiliates may make loans to, accept
deposits from, acquire Securities in, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting, or
other business with Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any other Person party to any Loan Documents as though the
Agents were not Agents hereunder, and, in each case, without notice to or consent of the other members of the Lender Group. The
other members of the Lender Group acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Agents or their Affiliates may receive information
regarding Borrower or its Affiliates or Borrower’s external manager and its Affiliates and any other Person party to any
Loan Documents that is subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Borrower or such other Person and that prohibit
the disclosure of such information to the Lenders, and the Lenders acknowledge that, in such circumstances (and in the absence
of a waiver of such confidentiality obligations, which waiver the Agents will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain),
the Agents shall not be under any obligation to provide such information to them. The terms “Lender” and “Lenders”
include each Agent in its individual capacity.
 

 - 84 - 
 

 
10.9         Successor
Agent. 
 
(a)          Any
Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. At any time, the Agent may be removed by
the Required Lenders or the Borrower, upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to such Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower.
Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the
Borrower, to appoint a successor Agent for the Lenders. In connection with a resignation, if no such successor shall have been
so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent
gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier date as may be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective
Date”), then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent
meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that in no event shall any such successor Agent be a Defaulting Lender.
Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation
Effective Date. Upon the occurrence of a Removal Event, an Agent may be removed upon five (5) Business Days’ prior written
notice by the Required Lenders or the Borrower, delivered to such Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower; provided, however,
that, such removal shall not be effective until a successor Agent acceptable to the Required Lenders has been selected; provided,
further, that if no such successor Agent has been appointed within thirty (30) days of such removal, the Required Lenders
or the Borrower may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Agent.
 
(b)          If
the Person serving as Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Agent and,
in consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders
and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders)
(the “Removal Effective Date”), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such
notice on the Removal Effective Date.
 
(c)          With
effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (i) the retiring or removed Agent shall
be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral
security held by the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Collateral
Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Collateral Agent is appointed) and (ii) except
for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be
made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as an Agent hereunder,
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed
Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Agent), and the retiring or removed Agent shall
be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Borrower
to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such
successor. After the retiring or removed Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the
provisions of this Article X and Section 8.1 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed
Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Agent-Related Persons in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any
of them while the retiring or removed Agent was acting as Agent.
 

 - 85 - 
 

 
10.10       Lender
in Individual Capacity. Any Lender and its respective Affiliates may make loans
to, accept deposits from, acquire Securities in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting,
or other business with Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any other Person party to any Loan Documents as though
such Lender were not a Lender hereunder without notice to or consent of the other members of the Lender Group. The other members
of the Lender Group acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, such Lender and its respective Affiliates may receive information
regarding Borrower or its Affiliates or Borrower’s external manager and its Affiliates and any other Person party to any
Loan Documents that is subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Borrower or such other Person and that prohibit
the disclosure of such information to the Lenders, and the Lenders acknowledge that, in such circumstances (and in the absence
of a waiver of such confidentiality obligations, which waiver such Lender will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain),
such Lender shall not be under any obligation to provide such information to them.
 
10.11       Withholding
Taxes.
 
(a)          Any
and all payments made by the Borrower hereunder or under any note or other Loan Document will be made free and clear of, and without
deduction or withholding for, any present or future Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined
in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such
payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding
and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after
such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction
or withholding been made. The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law,
or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of any Other Taxes. The Borrower will furnish
to the Administrative Agent as soon as practicable after the date the payment of any Tax is due pursuant to applicable law certified
copies of tax receipts issued by the applicable Governmental Authority evidencing such payment of such Tax by the Borrower, a
copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified
Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to an amount payable under this Section 10.11),
payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted
by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower
by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by an Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. For purposes of this Section 10.11, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.
 
(b)          Each
Agent shall deliver to the Borrower a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 on or prior to the date it becomes an Agent
under this Agreement and at any other time reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower. If a Lender is entitled
to claim an exemption from, or reduction of, United States withholding tax, Lender agrees with and in favor of the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower, to deliver to the Administrative Agent whichever of the following is applicable:
 

 - 86 - 
 

 
(i)          if
such Lender claims an exemption from United States federal withholding tax pursuant to the portfolio interest exception under Section
881(c) of the Code, (A) a statement of the Lender, signed under penalty of perjury, that it is not (I) a “bank” as
described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (II) a 10.0% shareholder of the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B)
of the Code), or (III) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, and (B) a
properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form), as applicable, on or prior to the date it becomes
a Lender under this Agreement and at any other time reasonably requested by Administrative Agent or the Borrower;
 
(ii)         if
such Lender claims an exemption from, or a reduction of, withholding tax under an income tax treaty to which the United States
is a party, two properly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form), as applicable, on or
prior to the date it becomes a Lender under this Agreement and at any other time reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent
or the Borrower;
 
(iii)        if
such Lender claims that interest paid under this Agreement is exempt from United States withholding tax because it is effectively
connected with a United States trade or business of such Lender, two properly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI
(or successor form) (together with applicable attachments) on or prior to the date it becomes a Lender under this Agreement and
at any other time reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower;
 
(iv)        two
properly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or successor form) (together with the relevant documentation under this
Section 10.11(b) and/or any other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable) on or prior to
the date it becomes a Lender under this Agreement and at any other time reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the
Borrower; or
 
(v)         such
other form or forms, including IRS Form W-9 (or successor form), as may be required under the Code or other laws of the United
States as a condition to exemption from, or reduction of, United States withholding or backup withholding tax on or prior to the
date it becomes a Lender under this Agreement and at any other time reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower.
 
Each Agent and each such
Lender agree to promptly notify, in writing, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of any change in circumstances which would
modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction. Each Agent and each such Lender agree to update any expired, obsolete
or inaccurate form provided pursuant to Section 10.11(b), (c) or (g) or to promptly notify the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 

 - 87 - 
 

 
(c)          If
an Agent or a Lender is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax in a jurisdiction other than the United
States or backup withholding, such Agent or such Lender agrees with and in favor of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to
deliver to the Administrative Agent any such form or forms as may be required as a condition to exemption from, or reduction of,
foreign withholding or backup withholding tax on or prior to the date it becomes an Agent or a Lender under this Agreement and
at any other time reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower.
 
Each Agent and each such
Lender agrees promptly to notify, in writing, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of any change in circumstances which would
modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.
 
(d)          If
any Lender claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax and such Lender sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or
otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of the Borrower, such Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner of Obligations of the Borrower. To the extent of
such percentage amount, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower will treat such Lender’s documentation provided pursuant
to Sections 10.11(b), 10.11(c) or 10.11(g) as no longer valid. With respect to such percentage amount, such
Lender may provide new documentation, pursuant to Sections 10.11(b), 10.11(c) or 10.11(g), if applicable.
 
(e)          If
any Lender is entitled to a reduction in the applicable withholding tax, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment
to such Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into account such reduction. If the forms or
other documentation required by subsection (b), (c) or (g) of this Section 10.11 are not delivered
to the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to such Lender not providing such forms
or other documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.
 
(f)           If
any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it
has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 10.11 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 10.11),
it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under
this Section 10.11 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes)
of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect
to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the
amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying
party pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position
than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been
deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never
been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other
information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 

 - 88 - 
 

 
(g)          If
a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender
were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b)
of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed
by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed
by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply
with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA
or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 10.11(g), “FATCA”
shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
(h)          Each
party’s obligations under this Section 10.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agents or any assignment
of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge
of all obligations under any Loan Document.
 
10.12       Collateral
and Guarantor Matters.

Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent to, and the Collateral Agent shall:

the avoidance of doubt, the Proceeds of such Asset) upon the termination of the Commitments and payment and satisfaction in full
by the Borrower of all Obligations;
 
(ii)         release
any Lien and/or negative pledge granted pursuant to the Negative Pledge Agreement, as applicable, on any Asset (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Proceeds of such Asset), including any Subsidiary of the Borrower:

in contemplation of the incurrence, assumption or purchase of Debt pursuant to Section 6.1 (and the imposition of a Permitted

within fifteen (15) days of the delivery of such certificate (the “Permitted Debt Certificate”) or (y) in connection
with the incurrence, assumption or purchase of Debt pursuant to Section 6.1 (and the imposition of a Permitted Lien pursuant
to Section 6.2), in each case on such terms (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in respect to the priority of such Liens
granted, in each case in connection with the incurrence, assumption or purchase of such Debt) as is reasonably satisfactory to
the party incurring, assuming or acquiring such Debt and the lender of any such Debt; provided however, if, in the event
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries does not incur Debt contemplated by subclause (x) of this clause (A) within
fifteen (15) days of the delivery of the Permitted Debt Certificate, any Lien and/or negative pledge that was released by the Collateral
Agent in connection with such Permitted Debt Certificate shall be reinstated with respect to such released Collateral and such
Grantor shall deliver such additional pledge and security documents as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request in order to
give effect to such reinstatement; or

on any such certificate, without further inquiry); or
 
(iii)        release
any Guarantor, Negative Pledgor or Grantor from its obligations hereunder if the Borrower certifies to the Collateral Agent that
such Guarantor, Negative Pledgor or Grantor is being sold pursuant to a Sale that is permitted under Section 6.6 of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents (and the Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on any such certificate, without further
inquiry).
 
(b)          Upon
the occurrence of any event set forth in clause (a) above, (i) each applicable Asset (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Proceeds of such Asset) shall automatically, and without further action, be released as Collateral for all purposes
under the Loan Documents; provided however, if, in the event the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries does not incur Debt
contemplated by clause (a)(ii)(A)(x) above within fifteen (15) days of the delivery of the Permitted Debt Certificate, any
Collateral that was released shall be reinstated with respect to such released Collateral and such Grantor shall deliver such additional
pledge and security documents as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request in order to give effect to such reinstatement and
(ii) upon the request, and at the expense of the Borrower, the Agents agree, as applicable, to execute and deliver such release
documents and take such other actions to acknowledge, evidence or complete any such release of such Asset or Person as may be reasonably
requested by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that upon request by the Collateral Agent
or the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Collateral Agent’s authority
to release any such Liens and/or negative pledges granted pursuant to the Negative Pledge Agreement, as applicable, on particular
types or items of Assets (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Proceeds of such Asset) pursuant to this Section 10.12;
provided, further, that (1) the Collateral Agent shall not be required to execute any document necessary to evidence
such release on terms that, in the Collateral Agent’s opinion, would expose the Collateral Agent to liability or create any
obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Lien without recourse, representation, or warranty, and (2)
such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly being
released) upon (or obligations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of) all interests retained by the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries, including, the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.

(c)          The
Agents shall have no obligation whatsoever to any of the Lenders to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by the Borrower
or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Collateral Agent’s Liens have been properly or
sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise
at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights,
authorities and powers granted or available to the Agents pursuant to any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed
that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission, or event related thereto, subject to the terms and conditions contained
herein, the Agents may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion given the Collateral Agent’s own

of the Lenders agrees that it shall not, until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, without the express written
consent of the Agents, and that it shall, to the extent it is lawfully entitled to do so, upon the written request of the Agents,
set off against the Obligations, any amounts owing by such Lender to the Borrower or any deposit accounts of the Borrower now or
hereafter maintained with such Lender. Each of the Lenders further agrees that it shall not, unless specifically requested to do
so in writing by the Agents (which request shall not be made by the Agents unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing),

at any time or times any Lender shall receive (i) by payment, foreclosure, setoff, or otherwise, any Proceeds of Collateral or
any payments with respect to the Obligations, except for any such proceeds or payments received by such Lender from the Agents
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) payments from the Agents in excess of such Lender’s ratable portion of all
such distributions by the Agents, such Lender promptly shall (1) turn the same over to the Agents, in kind, and with such
endorsements as may be required to negotiate the same to the Agents, or in immediately available funds, as applicable, for the
account of all of the Lenders and for application to the Obligations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement,
or (2) purchase, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in the Obligations owed to the other Lenders
so that such excess payment received shall be applied ratably as among the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares; provided,
however, that to the extent that such excess payment received by the purchasing party is thereafter recovered from it, those
purchases of participations shall be rescinded in whole or in part, as applicable, and the applicable portion of the purchase price

5.3(a), (b) and (c) (each a “Report” and collectively, “Reports”), and
the Agents shall so furnish each Lender with such Reports,

agrees and acknowledges that the Agents do not (i) make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any Report, and (ii)
shall not be liable for any information contained in any Report,

and the other Loan Parties, as well as on representations of the Borrower’s personnel,
 
(d)          agrees
to keep all Reports and other material, non-public information regarding Borrower and its Subsidiaries and their operations, assets,
and existing and contemplated business plans in a confidential manner in accordance with Section 11.12, and
 
(e)          without
limiting the generality of any other indemnification provision contained in this Agreement, agrees: (i) to hold any Agent and any
other Lender preparing a Report harmless from any action the indemnifying Lender may take or fail to take or any conclusion the
indemnifying Lender may reach or draw from any Report in connection with any loans or other credit accommodations that the indemnifying
Lender has made or may make to the Borrower, or the indemnifying Lender’s participation in, or the indemnifying Lender’s
purchase of, a loan or loans of the Borrower, and (ii) to pay and protect, and indemnify, defend and hold any Agent, and any such
other Lender preparing a Report harmless from and against, the claims, actions, proceedings, damages, costs, expenses, and other
amounts (including, attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by any Agent and any such other Lender preparing a Report as the
direct or indirect result of any third parties who might obtain all or part of any Report through the indemnifying Lender.

In addition to the foregoing:
(x) any Lender may from time to time request of the Agent in writing that the Agents provide to such Lender a copy of any report
or document provided by the Borrower to the Agents that has not been contemporaneously provided by the Borrower to such Lender,
and, upon receipt of such request, the Agents promptly shall provide a copy of same to such Lender, (y) to the extent that the
Agents are entitled, under any provision of the Loan Documents, to request additional reports or information from Borrower, any
Lender may, from time to time, reasonably request the Agents to exercise such right as specified in such Lender’s notice
to the Agents, whereupon the Agents promptly shall request of the Borrower the additional reports or information reasonably specified
by such Lender, and, upon receipt thereof from Borrower, the Agents promptly shall provide a copy of same to such Lender, and (z)
any time that the Administrative Agent renders to the Borrower a statement regarding the Loan Account, the Administrative Agent
shall send a copy of such statement to each Lender.
 
10.18       Several
Obligations; No Liability. Notwithstanding that certain of the Loan Documents now
or hereafter may have been or will be executed only by or in favor of the Agents in its capacity as such, and not by or in favor
of the Lenders, any and all obligations on the part of any Agent to make any credit available hereunder shall constitute the several
(and not joint) obligations of the respective Lenders on a ratable basis, according to their respective Commitments, to make an
amount of such credit not to exceed, in principal amount, at any one time outstanding, the amount of their respective Commitments.
Nothing contained herein shall confer upon any Lender any interest in, or subject any Lender to any liability for, or in respect
of, the business, assets, profits, losses, or liabilities of any other Lender. Each Lender shall be solely responsible for notifying
its Participants of any matters relating to the Loan Documents to the extent any such notice may be required, and no Lender shall

member of the Lender Group shall have any liability for the acts of any other member of the Lender Group. No Lender shall be responsible
to the Borrower or any other Person for any failure by any other Lender to fulfill its obligations to make credit available hereunder,
nor to take any other action on its behalf hereunder or in connection with the financing contemplated herein.

MISCELLANEOUS
 
11.1         No
Waivers, Remedies. No failure or delay on the part of any Agent or any Lender,
or the holder of any interest in this Agreement in exercising any right, power, privilege, or remedy under this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents shall impair or operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, privilege, or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, privilege,
or remedy. The waiver of any such right, power, privilege, or remedy with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall
not be deemed to be a waiver with respect to other facts and circumstances. The remedies provided for under this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies that may be available to any Agent or any Lender,
or the holder of any interest in this Agreement at law, in equity, or otherwise.
 
11.2         Waivers
and Amendments. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, and no consent with respect to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless the same
shall be in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent, Required Lenders (or by the Agents at the written request of the Required
Lenders) and the Borrower and then any such waiver or consent shall be effective, but only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such waiver, amendment, or consent shall:
 
(a)          postpone
or delay any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees, or other amounts
due hereunder or under any other Loan Document, without the prior written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected
thereby,
 
(b)          reduce
the principal of, or the rate of interest on, or the Yield Maintenance Premium, if any, any Loan or other extension of credit hereunder,
or reduce any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document, without the prior written consent of each
Lender directly and adversely affected thereby,
 
(c)          change
the Pro Rata Share that is required to take any action hereunder, without the prior written consent of each Lender,
 
(d)          amend
or modify this Section or any provision of the Agreement providing for consent or other action by all Lenders, without the prior
written consent of each Lender,
 

 - 94 - 
 

 
(e)          other
than as permitted by Section 10.12, release the Collateral Agent’s Lien in and to any of the Collateral, without the
prior written consent of each Lender,
 
(f)           change
the definition of “Required Lenders” or “Pro Rata Share”, without the prior written consent of each Lender,
 
(g)          other
than as permitted by Section 10.12, release any Loan Party from any obligation for the payment of money, without the prior
written consent of each Lender, or
 
(h)          amend
any of the provisions of Article X, without the prior written consent of each Lender.
 
and, provided further, however,
that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Agents, affect the rights or duties of the Agents
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no amendment, termination or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents, or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom,
shall be made other than by a solicitation of all Lenders, in a manner that treats all Lenders in the same manner, and that requires
that any consent fee or other consideration payable in connection therewith be payable ratably to all Lenders who consent to the
requested amendment, termination, waiver or consent.
 
If, in connection with
any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of “each Lender” or “each Lender directly affected
thereby,” the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other necessary Lenders is not obtained (any
such Lender whose consent is necessary but not obtained being referred to herein as a “Non-Consenting Lender”),
then the Borrower may at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender
to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required
by, Section 9.1), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.11
or Section 10.11) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall
assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:
 
(i)          the
Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 9.1(b)(iv);
 
(ii)         such
Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued
fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents from the assignee (to the extent of such
outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
 
(iii)        in
the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.11 or payments required to be made
pursuant to Section 10.11, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
 

 - 95 - 
 

 
(iv)        such
assignment does not conflict with applicable law; and
 
(v)         in
the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented
to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.
 
A Lender shall not be
required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
 
11.3         Notices.
Except as otherwise provided herein, all notices, demands, instructions, requests, and other communications required or permitted
to be given to, or made upon, any party hereto shall be in writing and shall be delivered or sent by registered or certified mail,
postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or by courier or electronic mail (at such email addresses as a party may designate
in accordance herewith) and shall be deemed to be given for purposes of this Agreement on the day that such writing is received
by the Person to whom it is to be sent pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in a notice sent
or delivered in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.3, notices, demands, requests, instructions,
and other communications in writing shall be given to or made upon the respective parties hereto at their respective addresses
indicated on Exhibit 11.3 attached hereto.
 
11.4         Release
of Borrowing Base Eligible Assets. Upon receipt by the Agents of a written notice
from the Borrower at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date that the Borrower wishes to remove an Asset from the pool
of Borrowing Base Eligible Assets (including but not limited to pursuant to Section 10.12 hereof), for all purposes herein,
such Asset shall be removed from the pool of Borrowing Base Eligible Assets for all purposes hereunder upon satisfaction of the
following:
 
(a)          the
Borrower shall deliver to the Agents a description of the relevant Asset to be removed;
 
(b)          the
Borrower shall deliver to the Agents a certificate of a Responsible Officer certifying that on a pro forma basis after giving effect
to such removal, the Borrower is in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in Section 6.12; and
 
(c)          no
Default or Event of Default shall exist or would be caused by releasing such Asset.
 
11.5         Valuation
Confirmation Process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may, at any time,
at Borrower’s expense, retain the Initial Valuation Agent to undertake a valuation report (the “Valuation Report”)
with respect to any Borrowing Base Eligible Asset, which in the case of a Mortgage Asset, shall mean the value of the underlying
mortgaged property set forth in an updated appraisal provided by the Initial Valuation Agent (the Assigned Value in such Valuation
Report, the “Initial Valuation”).
 

 - 96 - 
 

 
(a)          Following
the receipt by the Borrower of a Valuation Report (and delivery of a copy thereof to the Agents), the Assigned Value in respect
of the relevant Borrowing Base Eligible Asset for the purposes of clause (b) of the definition of “Assigned Value”
shall be calculated based on the amount of the Initial Valuation (in each case, in accordance with the definition of Assigned Value),
unless the Required Agents notify the Borrower in writing (the “Initial Dispute Notice”) within five (5) Business
Days following receipt of such Valuation Report that the Required Agents dispute the Initial Valuation.
 
(b)          If
the Required Lenders, in good faith, dispute the Initial Valuation as set forth in Section 11.5(a) above, the Borrower and
the Required Lenders shall enter into good faith negotiations for two (2) Business Days to agree upon an amount that shall be used
as the Assigned Value for the relevant Borrowing Base Eligible Asset.
 
(c)          If
the Borrower and the Required Lenders cannot agree upon such amount, the Borrower and the Required Lenders, at Borrower’s
expense, shall retain the Second Valuation Agent to undertake a valuation report with respect to the Borrowing Base Eligible Asset,
which in the case of a Mortgage Asset, shall mean the value of the underlying mortgaged property set forth in an updated appraisal
provided by the Second Valuation Agent (the Assigned Value in such additional valuation report, the “Second Valuation”).
Following the receipt by the Borrower of such additional valuation report (and delivery of a copy thereof to the Agents) and if
the amount of the Second Valuation is no more than 10.0% greater or lesser than the amount of the Initial Valuation, the Assigned
Value in respect of the relevant Borrowing Base Eligible Asset for the purposes of clause (b) of the definition of “Assigned
Value” shall be the amount equal to the average of the Initial Valuation and the Second Valuation.
 
(d)          If
the Second Valuation is more than 10.0% greater or lesser than the amount of the Initial Valuation and either (i) the Required
Agents notify the Borrower in writing within five (5) Business Days following receipt of such additional valuation report that
the Required Lenders dispute the Second Valuation or (ii) the Borrower notifies the Agents in writing within five (5) Business
Days following receipt of such additional valuation report that it disputes the Second Valuation, the Borrower shall retain, at
Borrower’s expense, the Third Valuation Agent that is acceptable to the Required Lenders to undertake a valuation report
with respect to the Borrowing Base Eligible Asset, which in the case of a Mortgage Asset, shall mean the value of the underlying
mortgaged property set forth in an updated appraisal provided by the Third Valuation Agent (the Assigned Value in such additional
valuation report, the “Third Valuation”). If the amount of the Third Valuation falls within the range of the
Initial Valuation and the Second Valuation, the Assigned Value for such Borrowing Base Eligible Asset for the purposes of clause
(b) above shall be the amount of the Third Valuation. If the amount of the Third Valuation falls outside the range of the Initial
Valuation and the Second Valuation, the Assigned Value in respect of the relevant Borrowing Base Eligible Asset for purposes of
clause (b) of the definition of “Assigned Value” shall be the average of the Initial Valuation, the Second
Valuation and the Third Valuation. The “Determined Valuation” shall mean the valuation of any Borrowing Base
Eligible Asset pursuant to the process referred to above in these clauses (a)-(d) (such process, the “Valuation
Confirmation Process”); provided, that with respect to any Borrowing Base Eligible Asset which is a Mortgage Asset
(either at origination or as a result of a modification), the Borrower shall be required to obtain a valuation of the underlying
property as well as such Mortgage Asset to calculate the Determined Valuation.
 

 - 97 - 
 

 
It is understood and
agreed that, if a Valuation Confirmation Process is commenced, (i) the Valuation Confirmation Process shall be completed within
thirty (30) days of the delivery of the Initial Dispute Notice, (ii) the Initial Valuation shall apply for all purposes until the
completion of the Valuation Confirmation Process and (iii) after the completion of the Valuation Confirmation Process, the Determined
Valuation shall apply to such Borrowing Base Eligible Asset unless (a) the applicable VAE is continuing for a period of ninety
(90) days or more (other than pursuant to clause (vi) of the definition thereof) or (b) a new VAE has occurred, in which
instance the Borrower shall retain the valuation agent that conducted the Determined Valuation to undertake an updated valuation
(the “Updated Valuation”) for such Borrowing Base Eligible Asset every ninety (90) days; the value of such Borrowing
Base Eligible Asset shall be as determined in the Updated Valuation, provided, however, that the Required Lenders
shall be entitled to dispute the Updated Valuation, in which case the Borrower and the Required Lenders shall follow the procedures
set forth in the Valuation Confirmation Process in respect of the Updated Valuation.
 
11.6         Headings.

Agreement. The foregoing shall apply to each other Loan Document mutatis mutandis.
 
11.7         Execution
in Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to
be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement. Delivery of an executed

OF THE LENDER GROUP HEREBY AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE DECIDED BY A COURT
TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 11.10 WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE OTHER PARTY OR PARTIES HERETO TO WAIVER OF ITS OR THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.
 
11.11       Independence
of Covenants. All covenants under this Agreement and other Loan Documents shall
be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any one covenant, the fact that it
would be permitted by another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of an Event of Default or Default if such action is taken
or condition exists.

shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section
if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord

Article
XII

THE GUARANTY
 
12.1         The
Guarantee.
 
(a)          The
Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, guarantee to each Secured Party as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not merely
as surety, the payment of the Secured Obligations in full in cash when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment,
by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the terms thereof. Each Guarantor
hereby further jointly and severally agrees that if any of the Secured Obligations are not paid in full in cash when due (whether
at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise), each Guarantor
will promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or
renewal of any of the Secured Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full in cash when due (whether at extended maturity,
as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of
such extension or renewal.
 
(b)          Each
Guarantor, and by its acceptance of this Guaranty, the Agents and each other Secured Party, hereby confirms that it is the intention
of all such Persons that this Guaranty and the Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or
conveyance for purposes of any Debtor Relief Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or
any similar foreign, federal or state law to the extent applicable to this Guaranty and the Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder.
To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Agents, the other Secured Parties and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the
Obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the Obligations
of such Guarantor under this Guaranty not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under applicable law after giving full
effect to such Guarantor’s contribution rights but before taking into account any liabilities of such Guarantor under any
other guarantee of such Guarantor other than any other guarantee of any obligations that are secured on a pari passu basis
with the Obligations.
 

 - 101 - 
 

 
12.2         Obligations
Unconditional.
 
(a)          The
obligations of the Guarantors under Section 12.1 are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness,
validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents or other documents relating to the Secured Obligations, or
any substitution, release, impairment or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Secured Obligations, and,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute
a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor (other than payment in full in cash of the Secured Obligations,
other than Obligations (or any portion thereof) that are contingent in nature and for which no claim has been made (“Unliquidated
Obligations”)), it being the intent of this Section 12.2 that the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall
be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that it shall have no right of subrogation,
indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this Article XII until
such time as the Secured Obligations (other than Unliquidated Obligations) have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash and the
Commitments have expired or terminated.
 
Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the occurrence of any one or more of the
following shall not alter or impair the liability of any Guarantor hereunder, which shall remain absolute and unconditional as
described above:
 
(b)          at
any time or from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Secured
Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived;
 
(c)          the
maturity of any of the Secured Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Secured Obligations shall be modified, supplemented
or amended in any respect, or any right under any of the Loan Documents or other documents relating to the Secured Obligations
shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Secured Obligations or any security therefor shall be released, impaired or
exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;
 
(d)          any
Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Collateral Agent or any other holder of the Secured Obligations as security for any of the
Secured Obligations shall fail to attach or be perfected; or
 
(e)          any
of the Secured Obligations shall be determined to be void or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of any creditor
of any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated to the claims of any Person (including, without limitation, any creditor of Guarantor).
 

 - 102 - 
 

 
(f)          any
failure or omission to assert or enforce or agreement or election not to assert or enforce, delay in enforcement, or the stay or
enjoining, by order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the exercise or enforcement of, any claim or demand or any right,
power or remedy (whether arising under any Loan Document at law, in equity or otherwise) with respect to the Secured Obligations
or any agreement relating thereto, or with respect to any other guaranty of or security for the payment of the Secured Obligations;
 
(g)          any
exercise of remedies with respect to any security for the Secured Obligations (including, without limitation, any collateral, including
the Collateral, securing or purporting to secure any of the Secured Obligations) at such time and in such order and in such manner
as the Agents and the Secured Parties may decide and whether or not every aspect thereof is commercially reasonable and whether
or not such action constitutes an election of remedies and even if such action operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement
or subrogation or other right or remedy that any Guarantor would otherwise have, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing
or any other provisions hereof, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all benefits which might otherwise be available
to such Guarantor under applicable law;
 
(h)          any
other circumstance whatsoever which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor as an obligor in
respect of the Secured Obligations or which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of
the Borrower or any other Guarantor for the Secured Obligations, or of such Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Article
XII or of any security interest granted by any Guarantor, whether in an Insolvency Proceeding or in any other instance; or
 
(i)          with
respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest
and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Agents or any other holder of the Secured Obligations exhaust any right,
power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of the Loan Documents or other documents relating to the Secured Obligations,
or against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Secured Obligations.
 
12.3         Reinstatement.
The obligations of each Guarantor under this Article XII shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for
any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Secured Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored
by any holder of any of the Secured Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings under any Debtor Relief Law, and each
Guarantor agrees that it will jointly and severally indemnify the Agents and each holder of the Secured Obligations on demand
for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, the fees, charges and disbursements of one counsel for the
Agents, taken as a whole, and one counsel for the holders of any Secured Obligations, taken as a whole) incurred by the Agents
or such holders of the Secured Obligations in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses
incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment
under any proceedings under any Debtor Relief Law.
 
12.4         Certain
Additional Waivers. Each Guarantor further agrees that it shall have no right of
recourse to security for the Secured Obligations, except through the exercise of rights of subrogation pursuant to Section

and payable as provided in Article VII (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances
provided in said Article VII) for purposes of Section 12.1 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition
preventing such declaration (or preventing the Secured Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any
other Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the Secured Obligations being deemed to have become automatically
due and payable), the Secured Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person) shall forthwith become due and
payable by each Guarantor for purposes of Section 12.1. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that its respective obligations

each Guarantor shall have contribution rights against the other Guarantors as permitted under applicable law. Such contribution

been indefeasibly paid in full in cash and the Commitments have terminated.
 
12.7         Guaranty
of Payment; Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee given by each Guarantor in this
Article XII is a guaranty of payment and not of collection, is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Secured Obligations
whenever arising.

and Warranties of each Guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby (i) represents and warrants
to each Agent and each Lender as to itself that all representations and warranties relating to it contained in this Agreement

has duly authorized, executed and delivered this Agreement;
 
(d)          Such
Guarantor is not required to obtain any authorization, consent, approval, exemption or license from, or to file any registration
with, any government authority as a condition to the validity of, or to the execution, delivery or performance of, this Agreement;
 

 - 104 - 
 

 
(e)          There
is no action, suit or proceeding pending or threatened in writing against Guarantor before any court or arbitrator or any governmental
body, agency or official in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could affect, in a materially
adverse manner, the ability of Guarantor to perform any of its obligations under, or which in any manner questions the validity
of, this Agreement;
 
(f)          The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Guarantor does not contravene or constitute a default under any provision
of Guarantor’s certificate of incorporation or by-laws or any material contractual restriction binding on Guarantor, and
to the best of Guarantor’s knowledge does not contravene or constitute a default under any statue, regulation or rule of
any governmental authority;
 
(g)         This
Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
the effect of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar law affecting creditors' rights generally, and
to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
and
 
(h)          Guarantor
is familiar with, and has independently reviewed books and records regarding, the financial condition of Borrower and is familiar
with the value of any and all collateral intended to be created as security for the payment of the Secured Obligations; however,
Guarantor is not relying on such financial condition or the collateral as an inducement to enter into this Agreement.
