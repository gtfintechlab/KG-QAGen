  25 




2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Term Loans. 
(a) Each Borrowing, each conversion of Term Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans
shall be made upon the Borrowers irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone; provided that, each telephonic notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must be

any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of Five Million and No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) or a whole multiple of One Million and No/100 Dollars
($1,000,000.00) in excess thereof. Each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000.00) or a whole multiple of One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars
($100,000.00) in excess thereof. Each Term Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Term Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate
Loans,

 Term Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Term Loans
to be borrowed or to which existing Term Loans are to be converted, and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Term Loan in a Term Loan Notice or if the Borrower
fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Term Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Eurodollar Rate Loans with an Interest Period of one (1) month. Any such automatic conversion to Eurodollar
Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such
Term Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month. 
(b) Following receipt of a Term Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Lender of the
amount of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Term Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each such Lender of the details of any automatic conversion
to Eurodollar Rate Loans described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Borrowing, each applicable Lender shall make the amount of its Term Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative
Agents Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Term Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02, the Administrative Agent shall make
all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent by wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower. 
  26 




(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be
continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During (x) the existence of an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), (f) or (g), or (y) solely to
the extent requested by the Required Lenders, during the existence of any other Event of Default, no Term Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders. 
(d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest
Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in Bank of Americas prime rate used
in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.  (e) After giving effect to all
Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten (10) Interest Periods in effect with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans. 
2.03 Prepayments.

voluntarily prepay Term Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be in the form of a Notice of Loan Prepayment and be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m.

($500,000.00) or a whole multiple of One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such
prepayment and the Type(s) of Term Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Term Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of
the amount of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the applicable Term Loan of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and
payable on the date specified therein; provided that a Notice of Loan Prepayment delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other transactions, in which case such notice may be revoked by the
Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together
with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Term Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages.

to the foregoing provisions of clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 2.03(b) shall be applied to the 364-Day Term Loans. Subject to

outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. 
(b) (i) If any Event of Default has occurred under Section 8.01(a)(i) or (ii), whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. 
  28 




(ii) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on
past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.  (c) Interest on each Term Loan shall be due and payable in
arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.  2.07 Fees. 
(a) The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts
and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 
(b) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at
the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.  2.08
Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Rate.  (a) All computations of interest
for Base Rate Loans shall be made on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty-five (365) or three hundred sixty-six (366) days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations
of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a three hundred sixty-five
(365) day year). Interest shall accrue on each Term Loan for the day on which the Term Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Term Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Term Loan or such portion is paid, provided that
any Term Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.10(a), bear interest for one (1) day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  (b) If, as a result of any restatement of or
other adjustment to the financial statements of the Borrower or for any other reason, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent reasonably determine that (i) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date
was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the applicable Lenders, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States,
automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent or any Lender), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for
such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, under Section 2.06(b) or under Article VIII. The Borrowers obligations under this paragraph
shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder. 
  29 




2.09 Evidence of Debt. 
The Term Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative
Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Term Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest
and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict
between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon
the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Term Loan Note or Term Loan Notes, which shall evidence such Lenders Term Loans in
addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Term Loan Note(s) and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Term Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
2.10 Payments Generally; Administrative Agents Clawback. 
(a) General. Except as provided in Section 3.01, all payments to be made by the Borrower shall
be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for
the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agents Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will
promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lenders Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative
Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. 
(b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any
administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the 
  30 




Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender
shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share
of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Term Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have
against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.  (ii) Payments by Borrower;
Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the
Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event,
if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with
banking industry rules on interbank compensation.  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any
amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  (c) Failure to Satisfy
Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Term Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the
Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Borrowing set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds
as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.  (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations
of the Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Term Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment
under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so
make its Term Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c). 
(e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Term Loan in any
particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Term Loan in any particular place or manner. 
2.11 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise,
obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Term Loans made by it resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Term Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon
greater than its pro rata share thereof as 
  31 




provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative
Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Term Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders
ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Term Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that: 
(i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the
Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment
of or sale of a participation in any of its Term Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.  2.12 Defaulting Lenders. 
(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a
Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law: 
(i) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or
consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and Section 10.01. 
(ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 10.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent
hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Term Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by
the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with
respect to Term Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Non-Defaulting Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Non-Defaulting Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, to the payment of any 
  32 




amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of
competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Term Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Term Loans were made at a
time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Term Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata
basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Term Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Term Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder without giving effect to
Section 2.12(b). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this
Section 2.12(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a
Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par
that portion of outstanding Term Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Term Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their
Applicable Percentages, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a
Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder
arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.  ARTICLE III 
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 
3.01 Taxes. 
(a) Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes. 
(i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without
deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Administrative Agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by
the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, then the Administrative Agent or the Borrower shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection
(e) below.  (ii) If the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or
deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be
required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to 
  33 




subsection (e) below, (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full
amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased
as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.  (iii) If the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such
deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall
timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the
Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable
Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.  (b)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of the
Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.  (c) Tax Indemnifications. 
(i) The Borrower shall, and does hereby indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten
(10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01) payable or paid by such
Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto (other than penalties, interest and expenses payable by reason of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Recipient), whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the
Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to
Section 3.01(c)(ii) below. 
  34 




(ii) Each Lender shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make
payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, (x) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the
Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (y) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with
the provisions of Section 10.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender that are
payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the
relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off
and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii). 
(d) Evidence of Payments. Upon request by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any
payment of Taxes by the Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver
to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment
reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be.  (e) Status of Lenders; Tax
Documentation.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to
payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent,
shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to
backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material
unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  (ii) Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person,  (A) any Lender that is a U.S.
Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 
  35 




(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do
so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter
upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:  (I)
in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or IRS Form W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article
of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or IRS Form
W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; 
(II) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; 
(III) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c)
of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code,
a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance
Certificate) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or IRS Form W-8BEN, as applicable); or 
(IV) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form
W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or IRS Form W-8BEN, as applicable), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, IRS
Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign
Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and
indirect partner;  (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request
of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary
documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
  36 




(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject
to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as
prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their
obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA
shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date.  (iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or
certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.  (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable
Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such
Lender. If any Recipient determines, in its reasonable discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes (including any application or carry-over of such refund amount to reduce any amount otherwise payable to the
refunding Governmental Authority) as to which it has been indemnified by an indemnifying party or with respect to which it has been paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to the indemnifying
party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to
such refund), provided that such indemnifying party, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such indemnifying part

ntal Authority) to
the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to an
indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to
indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to
require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
  37 




(g) Survival. Each partys obligations under this
Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or
discharge of all other Obligations.  3.02 Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law has
made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Term Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the
Eurodollar Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the
London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans
shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate
on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist (which notice such Lender agrees to give promptly). Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be
determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such
day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the
Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is
no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 
3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. 
(a) If in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, (i) the
Administrative Agent determines that (A) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (B) (x) adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan and (y) the circumstances described
in Section 3.03(c)(i) do not apply (in each case with respect to this clause (i), Impacted Loans), or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason the
Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify
the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a
determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the 
  38 




Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component
in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice (which the Administrative Agent agrees promptly to do upon determination by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist). Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar
Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this
Section, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower and the affected Lenders, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the
Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a)(i) of this Section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders notify the Borrower that such
alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is
unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Term Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any
Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof. 
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, if the Administrative Agent
reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to Borrower) that the Borrower or Required
Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that:  (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for
any requested Interest Period, including, without limitation, because the LIBOR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or 
(ii) the administrator of the LIBOR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent
has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR or the LIBOR Screen Rate shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no
successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that will continue to provide LIBOR after such specific date (such specific date, the Scheduled Unavailability Date) 
(iii) syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include language similar to that contained in this
Section 3.03, are being executed or amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace LIBOR. 
then, reasonably promptly after such determination by the Administrative Agent or receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, as
applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing LIBOR in accordance with this Section 3.03 with (x) one or more SOFR-Based Rates or (y) another
alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any 
  39 




evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for
such alternative benchmarks and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities
for such benchmarks, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated (the
Adjustment; and any such proposed rate, a LIBOR Successor Rate), and any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such
proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders (A) in the case of an amendment to
replace LIBOR with a rate described in clause (x), object to the Adjustment; or (B) in the case of an amendment to replace LIBOR with a rate described in clause (y), object to such amendment; provided that for the avoidance of doubt, in the
case of clause (A), the Required Lenders shall not be entitled to object to any SOFR-Based Rate contained in any such amendment. Such LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the
extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. 
If no LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under clause (i) above exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date
has occurred (as applicable), the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, (to the extent of the
affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) the Eurodollar Rate component shall no longer be utilized in determining the Base Rate. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing
of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans
(subject to the foregoing clause (y)) in the amount specified therein.  Notwithstanding anything else herein, any definition of LIBOR
Successor Rate shall provide that in no event shall such LIBOR Successor Rate be less than zero for purposes of this Agreement.  In
connection with the implementation of a LIBOR Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan
Document, any amendments implementing such LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the
Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes to the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. 
3.04 Increased Costs. 
(a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e)); 
(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses
(b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable
thereto; or 
  40 




(iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other
condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender;  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to
increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Term Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Term Loan), or to reduce
the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided that the Borrower shall not be liable for such compensation if (x) the relevant Change in Law occurs on a date prior to the date such Lender becomes a party
hereto or (y) such Lender invokes Section 3.02.  (b) Capital Requirements. If any
Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Term Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or
such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then
from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
(c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section, setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount or amounts was determined and delivered to the Borrower
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 
(d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for
any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions
and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the one hundred and eighty (180) day period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).  (e) Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans. The Borrower
shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as Eurocurrency liabilities),
additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Term Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be
conclusive), which shall be due and 
  41 




payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Term Loan; provided the Borrower
shall have received at least ten (10) days prior written notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give written notice ten (10) days prior to the
relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable ten (10) days from receipt of such notice. 
3.05 Compensation for Losses. Upon written demand by any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to
time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense (other than loss of profit) incurred by it as a result of: 
(a) any conversion, payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period
for such Term Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  (b) any failure by
the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Term Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Eurodollar Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or 
(c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a
request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;  including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment
of funds obtained by it to maintain such Term Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the
foregoing.  For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender
shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Term Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period,
whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.  3.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. 
(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. Each Lender may make any Term Loan to the Borrower through any Lending
Office, provided that the exercise of this option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Term Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04, or the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or
if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then at the request of the Borrower such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Term Loans hereunder or
to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such
Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

  42 




(b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04 or gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the
account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in with Section 3.06(a), the Borrower may replace
such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13.  3.07 Survival. All of the Borrowers
obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and resignation of the Administrative Agent.

the holder or holders of such Indebtedness or the beneficiary or beneficiaries of such Guarantee (or a trustee or agent on behalf of such holder or holders or beneficiary or beneficiaries) to cause, with the giving of notice if required, such
Indebtedness to be demanded or to become due and payable or to be repurchased, prepaid, defeased or redeemed (automatically or otherwise), or an offer to repurchase, prepay, defease or redeem such Indebtedness to be made, prior to its stated
maturity, or such Guarantee to become payable and such failure is not waived; or (ii) there occurs under any Swap Contract an Early Termination Date (as defined in such Swap Contract) resulting from (A) any Event of Default (as defined in
such Swap Contract) as to which the Borrower is the Defaulting Party (as defined in such Swap Contract) that is not waived and continues beyond any cure period provided therein or (B) any Termination Event (as defined in such Swap Contract)
under such Swap Contract as to which the Borrower is an Affected Party (as defined therein) and, in either event, the Swap Termination Value owed by the B

4201 of ERISA under a Multiemployer Plan in
an aggregate amount that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or  (j) Invalidity of the
Credit Agreement. Any material provision of the Credit Agreement, at any time after its execution and delivery and for any reason other than as expressly permitted hereunder or thereunder or the occurrence of the Termination Date, ceases to be
in full force and effect; or the Borrower contests in writing or pursuant to judicial proceedings the validity or enforceability of any material provision of the Credit Agreement; or the Borrower denies in writing that it has any or further
liability or obligation under the Credit Agreement (other than by reason of the Termination Date), or purports to revoke, terminate or rescind any material provision of the Credit Agreement; or 
(k) Change of Control. There occurs any Change of Control. 
  59 




8.02 Remedies Upon Event of Default. If any Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of, or may, with the consent of, the Required Lenders, by prior written notice to the Borrower (other than with respect to an Event of Default pursuant to
Section 8.01(f)) take any or all of the following actions:  (a) declare the commitment of each
Lender to make Term Loans to be terminated, whereupon such commitments and obligation shall be terminated;  (b) declare the
unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Term Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest
or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower; and  (c) exercise on behalf of
itself and the Lenders all rights and remedies available to it and the Lenders under the Loan Documents;  provided, however, that upon the
occurrence of the entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, the obligation of each Lender to make Term Loans shall automatically terminate and the unpaid principal amount of all
outstanding Term Loans and all interest and other amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable, in each case without further act of the Administrative Agent or any Lender. 
8.03 Application of Funds. After the exercise of remedies provided for in Section 8.02 (or
after the Term Loans have automatically become immediately due and payable as set forth in the proviso to Section 8.02), any amounts received on account of the Obligations shall, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.12 be applied by the Administrative Agent in the following order:  First, to payment of that
portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent and amounts payable under Article III) payable to the Administrative Agent
in its capacity as such;  Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities and other amounts
(other than principal and interest) payable to the Lenders (including fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the respective Lenders and amounts payable under Article III), ratably among them in proportion to the respective amounts
described in this clause Second payable to them;  Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued
and unpaid interest on the Term Loans and other Obligations, ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third payable to them; 
Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid principal of the Term Loans, ratably among the Lenders, in
proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Fourth payable to them; and  Last, the balance, if any, after
the occurrence of the Termination Date, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.

ARTICLE IX 
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 
9.01 Appointment and Authority. 
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article (other than Section 9.06) are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party
beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any
fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
contracting parties.  9.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have
the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or
unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial
advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account
therefor to the Lenders or to provide notice to or consent of the Lenders with respect thereto.  9.03 Exculpatory
Provisions. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arranger, as applicable, shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in
nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent or the Arranger, as applicable:  (a)
shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; 
(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights
and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly
provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that
is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property
of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and 
  61 




(c) shall not, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the
failure to disclose, to any Lender any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to, or in
the possession of, the Administrative Agent, Arranger or any of their Related Parties in any capacity, except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein. 
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by the Administrative Agent
under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall
be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct
as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment. Any such action taken or failure to act pursuant to the foregoing shall be binding on all Lenders. The Administrative
Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender. 
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties have any duty or obligation to any Lender or participant or any other Person
to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or
thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to
confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its
Related Parties shall be responsible or have any liability for, or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance with the provisions of this Agreement relating to Disqualified Institutions. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not (i) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender, any Participant, or any prospective Lender or prospective Participant, is a Disqualified Institution, or
(ii) have any liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or participation of Term Loans, or disclosure of confidential information, to any Disqualified Institution. 
9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully
protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, communication, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website
posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it
to have been made by the proper Person, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Term Loan, that by its terms must be
fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of
such Term Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance
with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
  62 




9.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and
all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any
such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of
the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the
extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.  9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent. 
(a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of
any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an
Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent
gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders and the Borrower) (the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on
behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above (including the consent of the Borrower). Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance
with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.  (b) If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting
Lender, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders and the
Borrower) (the Removal Effective Date), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. 
(c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (i) the retiring or
removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of
the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then
owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the
Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above (including the consent of the Borrower). Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and
become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or removed) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in 
  63 





Section 3.01(g) and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective
Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as
provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring or
removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed
Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. 
9.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender
expressly acknowledges that none of the Administrative Agent nor the Arranger has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent or the Arranger hereafter taken, including any consent to, and acceptance of any
assignment or review of the affairs of the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent or the Arranger to any Lender as to any matter, including whether the
Administrative Agent or the Arranger have disclosed material information in their (or their Related Parties) possession. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent and the Arranger that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of, appraisal of, and investigation into, the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to
enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, any other Lender or any of their Related Parties
and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document
or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower. Each Lender represents and warrants that (i) the Loan Documents set forth the terms of a commercial lending facility and (ii) it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary
course and is entering into this Agreement as a Lender for the purpose of making, acquiring or holding commercial loans and providing other facilities set forth herein as may be applicable to such Lender, and not for the purpose of purchasing,
acquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument, and each Lender agrees not to assert a claim in contravention of the foregoing. Each Lender represents and warrants that it is sophisticated with respect to decisions to make, acquire
and/or hold commercial loans and to provide other facilities set forth herein, as may be applicable to such Lender, and either it, or the Person exercising discretion in making its decision to make, acquire and/or hold such commercial loans or to
provide such other facilities, is experienced in making, acquiring or holding such commercial loans or providing such other facilities. 
9.08 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Syndication Agents or the
Arranger listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder. 
  64 




9.09 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the
pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Term Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or
by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: 
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Term Loans
and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07 and 10.04) allowed in such
judicial proceeding; and  (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims
and to distribute the same;  and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender = to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative
Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07 and 10.04. 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any
Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding. 
9.10 Enforcement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the
authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Borrower or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted
and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Documents for the benefit of all applicable Persons. 
9.11 Certain ERISA Matters. 
(a) Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and
(y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the
Borrower, that at least one of the following is and will be true:  (i) such Lender is not using plan assets

(iii) (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a Qualified Professional Asset Manager (within the meaning
of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf of such Lender to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Term Loans, the

(iv) such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Administrative Agent, in its sole
discretion, and such Lender.  (b) In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause

Lender involved in such Lenders entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Term Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto).  ARTICLE X 
MISCELLANEOUS 
10.01 Amendments, Etc. Subject to Section 3.03(c), no amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) and the Borrower, as
the case may be, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such amendment,

Commitments of any Lender);  (c) postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any payment or
mandatory prepayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders (or any of them) or any scheduled or mandatory reduction of the Commitments hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender
directly affected thereby;  (d) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on, any Term Loan or

the Default Rate or (y) change the manner of computation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (including any change in such defined term or defined terms used directly or indirectly in the definition of Consolidated Leverage Ratio); 
(e) change Section 8.03 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required
thereby without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;  (f) change any provision of this Section or
the definition of Required Lenders or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder

thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto, (iii) this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to cure any ambiguity,

specifying that any waiver, amendment or modification may be made with the consent or approval of the Administrative Agent.  Notwithstanding the above:
 (A) each Lender is entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan that affects the Term
Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States supersedes the unanimous consent provisions set forth herein,

(x) the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender, (y) the principal owing to such Lender may not be decreased without the consent of such Lender and (z) the interest rate being paid
to such Lender may not be decreased without the consent of such Lender.  10.02 Notices; Effectiveness; Electronic Communication.

Related Parties have any liability to the Agent Parties, the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrowers or the
Administrative Agents transmission of Borrower Materials through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and non-appealable judgment to have resulted from a material breach of this Agreement by, or the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of, such Agent Party, or the Borrower or any of its Related Parties, as
applicable (provided that nothing herein shall limit the Borrowers indemnification obligations with respect to third party claims made pursuant to Section 10.04(b)); provided, however, that in no event
shall any Agent Party or the Borrower or its Related Parties have any liability to the Agent Parties, the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual
damages) (provided that nothing herein shall limit the Borrowers indemnification obligations with respect to third party claims made pursuant to Section 10.04(b)). Borrower Materials means,

(e) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative
Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including telephonic Term Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were
incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender and the Related Parties from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic notices to and other telephonic
communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording. 
10.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies; Enforcement. No failure by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and
no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by Law. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Borrower shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent
in accordance with Section 8.02 for the benefit of all the Lenders; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and
remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents or (b) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the
pendency of a proceeding relative to the Borrower under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (i) the
Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b) and (c) of the preceding proviso and
subject to Section 2.11, any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders. 
10.04 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. 
(a) Costs and Expenses. The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution,
delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated);
provided that payment of any legal fees and expenses incurred under this clause (i) shall be limited to those of one counsel for the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, taken as a whole, and (ii) all reasonable and
documented 
  70 





out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender (but limited, in the case of legal fees,
charges and disbursements, to those of one counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders taken as a whole (unless a conflict exists as determined in the good faith judgment of such affected Persons, in which case(s) the fees, charges and
disbursements of one reasonably necessary additional counsel for all such affected Persons, taken as a whole, shall be covered)), in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights (A) in connection with this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or (B) in connection with the Term Loans made hereunder, including all such reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Term Loans. 
(b) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (but limited, in the case of legal fees, charges and disbursements, to those reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket fees, charges and disbursements of one counsel for all Indemnitees, taken as a whole, plus, in the event of a conflict of interest as determined in the
good faith judgment of each affected Indemnitee, one additional counsel for all such affected Indemnitees, taken as a whole), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Borrower arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations
hereunder or thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the
administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including in respect of any matters addressed in Section 3.01), (ii) any Term Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any
actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or
(iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower, and regardless of whether
any Indemnitee is a party thereto, IN ALL CASES, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OUT OF THE COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNITEE; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any
Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment to
have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of, or a material breach of any Loan Document by, such Indemnitee or (y) arise out of any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding brought by such Indemnitee solely
against one or more other Indemnitees (other than any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding that is brought by or against the Administrative Agent or any similar agent, acting in its capacity as the Administrative Agent or such similar
role) that does not involve any act or omission of the Borrower or its Affiliates. The Borrower shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim effected by any Indemnitee without the consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), but if settled with the Borrowers written consent, or if there is a final judgment against an Indemnitee in any such proceeding, the Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless such Indemnitee in the manner
set forth above. This Section 10.04(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim. 
  71 




(c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower for any
reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party of any of
the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders Applicable Percentage (determined as of the
time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by
or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.10(d). 
(d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, no party hereto shall
assert, and each party hereto hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee or any other party hereto, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Term Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof; provided that
nothing herein shall limit the Borrowers indemnification obligations with respect to third party claims made pursuant to Section 10.04(b). No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above or any other
party hereto shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or

 a material breach of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or other party hereto, in each case, as determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction; provided that nothing herein shall limit the Borrowers indemnification obligations with respect to third party claims made pursuant to Section 10.04(b). 
(e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than thirty (30) days after receipt by
Borrower of written demand therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Indemnitee shall be obligated to refund or return any and all amounts paid by the Borrower to such Indemnitee under this Section for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities
and expenses to the extent such Indemnitee is not entitled to payment of such amounts in accordance with the terms of this Section. 
(f) Survival. The agreements in this Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement
of any Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.  10.05
Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the
proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its
discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be
satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had 
  72 





not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the
Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under clause (b) of the
preceding sentence shall survive the occurrence of the Termination Date.  10.06 Successors and Assigns. 
(a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder or thereunder without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of
this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (e) of this
Section, (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal
or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.  (b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender
may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Term Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such
assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:  (i) Minimum Amounts. 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment and the Term Loans
at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
(B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this
purpose includes Term Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Term Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment
and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if a Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than Five Million and No/100 Dollars
($5,000,000.00) unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), (f) or (g) has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an
Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met. 
  73 




(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as
an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders Term Loans and Commitments, and rights and obligations with respect thereto, assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a
portion of its rights and obligations in respect of its Commitment (and the related Term Loans thereunder) on a non-pro rata basis. 
(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection
(b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:  (A) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), (f) or (g) has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a
Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Disqualified
Institution; provided, further, that, the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment requiring its consent under this clause (A) unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten
(10) Business Days after having received written notice thereof; and  (B) the consent of the Administrative Agent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender; provided, that, (x) in consenting
to any such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible or have any liability for, or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Disqualified Institutions and
(y) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not (I) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender or prospective Lender is a Disqualified Institution or (II) have any
liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or participation of Term Loans, or disclosure of confidential information, to any Disqualified Institution. 
(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of Three Thousand Five Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($3,500.00) payable by the assignor; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its
sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. 
(v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Borrower or any Affiliates or
Subsidiaries of the Borrower or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or to any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute one of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B). 
  74 




(vi) No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be
made to a natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural person). 
(vii) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender
hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount
sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Term Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full
all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Term Loans in accordance
with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this
paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the
assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with respect to
facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any
claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Term Loan Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of
this Section.  (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower
(and such agency solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the
names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Term Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the
Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
  75 




(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent
of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Term Loans; provided that (i) such Lenders
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 10.04(c)
without regard to the existence of any participation.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such
Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in Section 10.01(a) through (f) that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section
(it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 10.13 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and
(B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive,
except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers request
and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to
the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.11 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a
participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and
stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Term Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any
portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Term Loans or its other Obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the
extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Term Loan or other Obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The
entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement
notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
(e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement (including under its Term Loan Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall
release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
  76 




(f) Disqualified Institutions. 
(i) The Borrower may request that a Disqualified Institution be added to the Disqualified Institution List pursuant to a
written notice to the Administrative Agent. Such Disqualified Institution shall only be added to the Disqualified Institution List upon the written consent of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the
Administrative Agent has not consented to any such request within 10 Business Days after receiving notice thereof then such request to add a Disqualified Institution shall be deemed to be denied. If the Administrative Agent does consent to a request
to add a Disqualified Institution then the Disqualified Institution List shall be updated and made available as set forth in Section 10.06(f)(v). 
(ii) No assignment or, to the extent the Disqualified Institution List has been posted on the Platform for all Lenders,
participation shall be made to any Person that was a Disqualified Institution as of the date (the Trade Date) on which the applicable Lender entered into a binding agreement to sell and assign or participate all or a portion of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement to such Person (unless the Borrower has consented to such assignment in its sole and absolute discretion (but, for the avoidance of doubt, otherwise subject to
Section 10.06(b)(iii)(A)), in which case such Person will not be considered a Disqualified Institution for the purpose of such assignment). For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any assignee or participant that
becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable Trade Date, such assignee shall not retroactively be considered a Disqualified Institution. Any assignment in violation of this clause (g)(ii) shall not be void, but the other provisions of
this clause (g) shall apply.  (iii) If any assignment is made to any Disqualified Institution without the
Borrowers prior consent in violation of clause (ii) above, the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Institution and the Administrative Agent, (A) terminate any Commitment of such
Disqualified Institution and repay all obligations of the Borrower owing to such Disqualified Institution in connection with such Commitment, or (B) require such Disqualified Institution to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance
with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 10.06), all of its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement and related Loan Documents to one or more Eligible Assignees that shall assume such
obligations at the lesser of (1) the principal amount thereof, (2) the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire such interests, rights and obligations, in each case plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts
(other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder and the other Loan Documents; provided that such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws. 
(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (A) Disqualified Institutions will not
(1) have the right to receive information, reports or other materials provided to Lenders by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, (2) attend or participate in meetings attended by the Lenders and the Administrative
Agent, or (3) access any electronic site established for the Lenders or confidential communications from counsel to or financial advisors of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, and (B)(1) for purposes of any consent to any amendment,
waiver or modification of, or any action under, and for the purpose of any direction to the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, each
Disqualified Institution will be deemed to have consented in the same proportion as the Lenders that are not 
  77 




Disqualified Institutions consented to such matter, and (2) for purposes of voting on
any plan of reorganization or plan of liquidation pursuant to any Debtor Relief Laws (Plan of Reorganization), each Disqualified Institution party hereto hereby agrees (I) not to vote on such Plan of Reorganization,
(II) if such Disqualified Institution does vote on such Plan of Reorganization notwithstanding the restriction in the foregoing clause (I), such vote will be deemed not to be in good faith and shall be designated pursuant to
Section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws), and such vote shall not be counted in determining whether the applicable class has accepted or rejected such Plan of Reorganization in accordance
with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws), and (III) not to contest any request by any party for a determination by the bankruptcy court (or other applicable court of competent
jurisdiction) effectuating the foregoing clause (II).  (v) The Administrative Agent shall have the right, and the Borrower
hereby expressly authorizes the Administrative Agent, to (A) post the list of Disqualified Institutions provided by the Borrower and any updates thereto from time to time (collectively, the Disqualified Institution List) on
the Platform, including that portion of the Platform that is designated for public side Lenders, and/or (B) provide the Disqualified Institution List to each Lender requesting the same. 
10.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to
maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed
of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties,
including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (in which case such Administrative Agent or Lender shall (i) except with respect to any audit or examination conducted by bank accountants or
any Governmental Authority exercising examination or regulatory authority, to the extent permitted by Law, endeavor to notify the Borrower promptly in advance thereof, and in any event, as soon as practical and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that any such Information so disclosed is accorded confidential treatment), (c) to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process (in which case such Administrative Agent or Lender
shall (i) to the extent permitted by Law, endeavor to inform the Borrower promptly in advance thereof, and in any event, as soon as practical and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any such Information so disclosed is
accorded confidential treatment), (d) to any other party hereto, (e) to the extent reasonably necessary or advisable, in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or
Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which
payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder (it being understood that the Disqualified Institution List may be disclosed to any assignee or Participant in, or any prospective
assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement in reliance on this clause (f)), (g) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or the credit facilities
provided hereunder (provided that any such disclosure shall be made in consultation with the Borrower) or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market
identifiers with respect to the credit facilities provided hereunder, (h) with the consent of the Borrower, (i) 
  78 




to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or (j) to data service providers, including league table
providers, that serve the lending industry.  For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received
from or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or
any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower or any of their representatives. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be
considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. 
Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material
non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state
securities Laws.  10.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (but subject to
the provisions of Section 10.03), each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or its Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or such Affiliate shall have made any
demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch or office or Affiliate
holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for
further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such
right of setoff. The rights of each Lender and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender
agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 
10.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest
paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate). If the Administrative Agent or any
Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Term Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest
contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable 
  79 




Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than
interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. 
10.10 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties
hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this
Agreement by telecopy or other electronic imaging means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 
10.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan
Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default
at the time of any Borrowing, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Term Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied shall remain outstanding. 
10.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations
to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any
provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited. 
10.13 Replacement of Lenders. If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04
or gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 3.01, (iii) a Lender (a Non-Consenting Lender) does not consent to a proposed amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination with respect to any Loan
Document that has been approved by the Required Lenders as provided in Section 10.01 but requires unanimous consent of all Lenders or all Lenders directly affected thereby (as applicable) or (iv) any Lender is a
Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate (and such Lender shall be obligated to assign and delegate), without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, 
  80 




rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and
obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which Eligible Assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that: 
(a) with respect to any assignment, the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in
Section 10.06(b);  (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the
outstanding par principal amount of its Term Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under
Section 3.05) from the Eligible Assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees), in the case of an assignment, or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
(c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or
payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
(d) in the case of an assignment, such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and 
(e) in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting
Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.  A Lender shall not be required to
make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
10.14 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc. 
(a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS (EXCEPT, AS TO ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AS EXPRESSLY SET

Lender has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent, the
Lenders and the Arranger with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby. 
10.17 USA PATRIOT Act Notice. Each Lender that is subject to the Patriot Act (as hereinafter defined) and the

Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; provided that notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to agree to accept electronic signatures in any form or in any format unless expressly
agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it and provided further without limiting the foregoing, upon the request of any party, any electronic signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed

  83 




10.20 Entire Agreement. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE
FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS

shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be
accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or 
(iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of
any EEA Resolution Authority.  10.22 Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that the Loan
Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap Contract or any other agreement or instrument that i

ive to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime
if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a
Covered Party becomes subject to a 
  84 





proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against
such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or
a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a
Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.  [rest of page intentionally blank]
