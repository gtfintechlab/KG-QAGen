ARTICLE 2 CREDIT FACILITY
 
2.1                               Revolving Loans.
 
(a)                                 Subject to, and upon the terms and conditions contained herein, each Lender agrees to make revolving credit loans to Borrower from time to time during the term of this Agreement in an amount not to exceed such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such advances. The Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loan of any Lender shall not at any time exceed its separate Revolving Loan Commitment. The obligations of each Lender hereunder shall be several and not joint. Until the Termination Date, after giving effect to such Revolving Loans, the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding shall not exceed the lesser of the Borrowing Base at such time or the Maximum Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Borrower may from time to time borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans; provided that if the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans at any time shall exceed the Borrowing Base at such time, as a result of an Eligible Debt Investment no longer being eligible for reasons that were unanticipated by the Borrower, the Borrower shall have fifteen (15) days to repay the Revolving Loans to the extent required to eliminate such excess or present to the Agent and Lenders a plan to repay Revolving Loans to the extent required to eliminate such excess, that is acceptable to the Required Lenders.
 
(b)                                 The Borrower shall execute and deliver to each Revolving Lender a Revolving Note to evidence the Revolving Loan Commitment of that Revolving Lender. Each Revolving Note shall be in the principal amount of the Revolving Loan Commitment of the applicable Revolving Lender, dated the Closing Date and substantially in the form of Schedule 2.1(b) (each, a Revolving Note and collectively, the Revolving Notes). Each Revolving Note shall represent the obligation of the Borrower to pay the amount of the Revolving Lenders
 
42





 
Revolving Loan Commitment or, if less, such Revolving Lenders Pro Rata Share of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Loans to Borrower, together with interest thereon as prescribed in Section 3.1.
 
2.2                               Requests for Borrowings.
 
(a)                                 To request a Revolving Loan, Borrower shall notify Agent (for prompt further notification from Agent to Lenders) of such request by telephone not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the same Business Day as the date of the proposed Revolving Loan. Each such telephonic request shall be irrevocable and to the extent required by Agent, shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or facsimile to Agent of a written request in a form approved by Agent and signed by a Responsible Officer of Borrower. Each such telephonic and written request shall specify the following information:
 
(i)                                     the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loan;
 
(ii)                                  the date of such Revolving Loan, which shall be a Business Day; and
 
(iii)                               the Deposit Account of Borrower specified on Schedule 8.10 or any other account with Agent that shall be specified in a written notice signed by a Responsible Officer of Borrower and delivered to and approved by Agent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld).
 
(b)                                 All Revolving Loans under this Agreement shall be conclusively presumed to have been made to, and at the request of and for the benefit of, Borrower when deposited to the credit of Borrower or otherwise disbursed or established in accordance with the instructions of Borrower or in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Except in Agents discretion, or as otherwise provided herein, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed the lesser of the Maximum Credit or the Borrowing Base.
 
2.3                               Incremental Facility.
 
(a)                                 So long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and are continuing, the Borrower may request, by written notice to the Agent, at any time the Lenders increase the existing Commitments (any such increase, the New Commitments) by an amount such that the amount of the Maximum Credit does not exceed Eighty Five Million Dollars ($85,000,000) in the aggregate (or such lesser amount, provided, however, the New Commitments shall be at least Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000)). Each such notice shall specify the date (each, an Increased Amount Date) on which the Borrower proposes that the New Commitments shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Agent. Borrower and Agent shall first offer to the existing Lenders at that time such New Commitments (if an existing Lender agrees to an increase, they shall be an Increasing Lender). In the event the existing Lenders decline to increase their Commitments to the full amount of New Commitments requested by the Borrower, Agent agrees to arrange such New Commitments and the Agent and the Borrower shall mutually agree on one or more acceptable Qualified Assignees (each, a New Lender) to provide the remaining amount of the New Commitments. If the Agent is unable to identify any acceptable New Lenders, then Borrower
 
43

 




 
shall be permitted to approach potential New Lenders identified to the Agent and approved in writing by the Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Borrower acknowledges the Agent is under no obligation to identify and obtain New Commitments from New Lenders. Borrower shall upon request of Agent provide such updated information as the Agent deems necessary to syndicate the New Commitments and such other information as the Lenders and any New Lender shall request. Any New Lender approached by the Agent or Borrower to provide all or a portion of the New Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a New Commitment. Such New Commitments shall become effective as of such Increased Amount Date; provided, that (A) no Default or Event of Default shall exist on such Increased Amount Date before or after giving effect to such New Commitments; (B) the New Commitments shall be effected pursuant to one or more Supplemental Agreements executed and delivered by the Borrower, such Increasing Lender (if applicable), such New Lenders (if applicable) and the Agent, and each of which shall be recorded in the Register and each New Lender shall be bound by and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (C) the Borrower shall make any payments required pursuant to this Agreement and the Fee Letter in connection with the New Commitments and shall pay any other required fees in connection with the New Commitments; and (D) the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered any legal opinions, certificates, promissory notes or other customary closing documents (substantially consistent with the documents set forth in Section 6 of this Agreement) reasonably requested by Agent, an Increasing Lender (if applicable) or a New Lender (if applicable) in connection with such transaction.
 
(b)                                 On any Increased Amount Date on which New Commitments are effected, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, (i) each of the existing Lenders shall assign to each of the Increasing Lender or New Lenders, as applicable, and each of the Increasing Lender or New Lenders, as applicable, shall purchase from each of the existing Lenders, at the principal amount thereof (together with accrued interest and fees), such interests in the Revolving Loans outstanding on such Increased Amount Date as shall be necessary in order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, such Revolving Loans will be held by the existing Lenders Increasing Lender or New Lenders, as applicable, ratably in accordance with their Commitments after giving effect to the addition of such New Commitments to the Commitments, (ii) each New Commitment shall be deemed, for all purpose, a Commitment, and each Revolving Loan made thereunder shall be deemed, for all purposes, a Revolving Loan under this Agreement, (iii) each New Lender if applicable, shall become a Lender with respect to the Commitments and all matters relating thereto and (iv) the Borrower shall execute one or more new Revolving Note(s), as required by the Agent, and deliver it to the Increasing Lenders or New Lenders, as applicable.
 
(c)                                  The Agent shall notify the Lenders promptly upon receipt of the Borrowers notice of each Increased Amount Date and in respect thereof (i) the New Commitments and the identities of the Increasing Lenders and New Lenders, as applicable, and (ii) in the case of each notice to any Lender, the respective interests in such Lenders Loans, in each case subject to the assignments contemplated by this Section 2.3.
 
(d)                                 The terms and provisions of the New Loans shall be identical to the Revolving Loans made hereunder. Each Supplemental Agreement may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as
 
44





 
may be necessary or appropriate, in the Agents Permitted Discretion, and consented to by the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), to effect the provisions of this Section 2.3.
 
ARTICLE 3 INTEREST AND FEES
 
3.1                               Rates and Payment of Interest.
 
(a)                                 All Obligations (including, to the extent permitted by law, interest not paid when due) shall bear interest at the following rates: (i) with respect to Prime Rate Loans, at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin; and (ii) with respect to LIBOR Loans, at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin, except as otherwise provided in this Section 3 below. At any time an Event of Default exists or has occurred and is continuing (and the Agent has sent, or the Required Lenders have directed the Agent to send, the Borrower written notice thereof) the Obligations shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date of such increase (whether before or after any judgment). Agent may, at its option (or at the direction of Required Lenders, shall), after written notice to the Borrower, increase the Interest Rate to the Default Rate from the date of such increase for Revolving Loans during any time that the principal amount of Revolving Loans outstanding is in excess of the Borrowing Base (in each case whether or not such excess (es) arise or are made with or without the knowledge or consent of Agent and whether made before or after an Event of Default).
 
(b)                                 Interest shall accrue from the date a Revolving Loan is made or Obligation is incurred or payable until paid in full by Borrower. If a Revolving Loan is repaid on the same day made, one days interest shall accrue. Interest accrued on the Revolving Loans shall be due and payable in arrears, (i) on the first day of each month and (ii) on the Termination Date. Interest accrued on any other Obligations shall be due and payable on each Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest accrued at the Default Rate shall be due and payable on demand.
 
3.2                               Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest and fees calculated on a per annum basis shall be calculated on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year and actual days elapsed. The interest rate on non-contingent Obligations shall increase or decrease as of the first day of each LIBOR Period by an amount equal to each increase or decrease in the LIBOR Rate since its determination for the prior LIBOR Period and shall remain in effect until the end of the then current LIBOR Period (except that in the case of any Prime Rate Loans, the interest rate shall increase or decrease effective on the date any change in such Prime Rate and by an amount equal to each increase or decrease in the Prime Rate). Each determination by Agent of any interest, fees or interest rate hereunder shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. All fees shall be fully earned when due and shall not be subject to rebate, refund or proration.
 
3.3                               Unused Line Fee. Borrower shall pay to Agent for the ratable benefit of Agent and Lenders an unused line fee on a monthly basis at a rate equal to three-quarters of one percent (.75%) (on a per annum basis) multiplied by the amount by which the Maximum Credit exceeds the average daily principal balance of the outstanding Revolving Loans during the immediately
 
45





 
preceding calendar month (or part thereof) so long as any Obligations are outstanding. Such fees shall be payable on the first day of each month in arrears.
 
3.4                               Termination Fee. If Borrower prepays the Revolving Loans and reduces or terminates the amount of the Maximum Credit, whether voluntarily or involuntarily and whether before or after acceleration of the Obligations, or if any of the Revolving Loan Commitments are otherwise terminated, Borrower shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of Lenders as liquidated damages and compensation for the costs of being prepared to make funds available hereunder an amount equal to the Applicable Percentage (as defined below) multiplied by the amount of the reduction of the Maximum Credit. As used herein, the term Applicable Percentage shall mean (x) two percent (2%), in the case of a permanent reduction or termination on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, (y) one percent (1%), in the case of a permanent reduction or termination after the first anniversary of the Closing Date but on or prior to the second anniversary thereof and (z) one-half of one percent (.5%), in the case of a permanent reduction or termination after the second anniversary of the Closing Date but on or prior to the third anniversary thereof. The Borrower agrees that the Applicable Percentages are a reasonable calculation of Lenders lost profits in view of the difficulties and impracticality of determining actual damages resulting from an early reduction of the Maximum Credit or termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments.
 
3.5                               Commitment Fee. Borrower shall pay to the Lenders a commitment fee in an amount equal to Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), to be allocated among the Lenders based on their respective Pro Rata Shares as of the Closing Date). The entire commitment fee shall be deemed fully earned by the Lenders and shall be due and payable in full on the Closing Date. In the event of an increase in the Commitments, the Borrower shall pay (i) to Agent for the benefit of the Increasing Lenders or New Lenders, as applicable, a commitment fee in such amount as shall be agreed upon by Agent, the Increasing Lenders, New Lenders and Borrower and (ii) to the Agent, individually, such fee, if any, specified in that certain fee letter of even date herewith between the Borrower and the Agent, at the time specified for payment therein. All such fees shall be deemed fully earned by the Agent, Increasing Lenders and/or New Lenders and shall be due and payable in full as agreed upon by Agent, the Increasing Lenders, New Lenders and Borrower.
 
3.6                               Agency Fee. Borrower shall pay to Agent, individually, the fee specified in that certain fee letter of even date herewith between Borrower and Agent, at the times specified for payment therein.
 
3.7                               Inability to Determine Applicable Interest Rate. If Agent shall determine in good faith (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on Borrower) that on any date by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank market adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to LIBOR Loans on the basis provided for in the definition of LIBOR Rate, Agent shall on such date give notice to Borrower of such determination. Upon such date no Revolving Loans may be made as LIBOR Loans until such time as Agent notifies Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist and any Revolving Loans shall be made as Prime Rate Loans.
 
46





 
3.8                               Illegality. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if (a) any Change in Law makes it unlawful for Lenders to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan or to maintain any Commitment with respect to a LIBOR Loan or (b) Agent determines in good faith (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that it has become impracticable as a result of a circumstance that adversely affects the London interbank market or the position of Lenders in such market, then Agent shall give notice thereof to Borrower and may (i) declare that LIBOR Loans will not thereafter be made by Lenders, such that any Revolving Loans made shall be a Prime Rate Loan unless Agents declaration has been withdrawn (and it shall be withdrawn promptly upon the cessation of the circumstances described in clause (a) or (b) above and (ii) require that all outstanding LIBOR Loans made by Lenders be converted to Prime Rate Loans immediately, in which event all outstanding LIBOR Loans shall be so converted.
 
3.9                               Increased Costs. If any Change in Law shall: (a) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, Agent or Lenders; (b) subject Agent or Lenders to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any LIBOR Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to Agent or Lenders in respect thereof (except for Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 4.7 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any taxes payable by Agent or Lenders described in Section 4.7); or (c) impose on Agent or Lenders or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Loans made by Agent or Lenders or participation therein, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to Agent or Lenders of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan (or of maintaining their obligation to make any such LIBOR Loan), or to increase the cost to Agent or Lenders or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by Agent or Lenders hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of Agent, Borrower will pay to Agent or Lenders, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Agent or Lenders, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
3.10                        Capital Requirements. If Agent determines that any Change in Law affecting Agent or Lenders or any lending office of Lenders or Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on Agents or Lenders capital or on the capital of Agents or Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of Lenders or the Revolving Loans made by Agent or Lenders to a level below that which Agent or Lenders or Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration Agents or Lenders policies and the policies of Agents or Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Borrower will pay to Agent or Lenders, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Agent or Lenders or Agents or Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
3.11                        Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of Agent or Lenders setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate Agent or Lenders or their holding companies, as the case may be, as specified in Sections 3.9 or 3.10 and delivered to Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrower shall pay Agent or Lenders, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof.
 
47





 
3.12                        Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of Agent or Lenders to demand compensation pursuant to Sections 3.9 or 3.10 shall not constitute a waiver of Agents or Lenders right to demand such compensation, provided that Borrower shall not be required to compensate Agent or Lenders pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions occurring more than ninety (90) days prior to the date that Agent or Lenders, as the case may be, becomes aware of the event giving rise to Agents or Lenders claim for compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the ninety (90) day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
 
3.13                        Maximum Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, in no event whatsoever shall the aggregate of all amounts that are contracted for, charged or received by Agent or Lenders pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and that are deemed interest under applicable law exceed the Maximum Interest Rate (including, to the extent applicable, the provisions of Section 5197 of the Revised Statutes of the United States of America as amended, 12 U.S.C. Section 85, as amended). In the event any interest is charged or received in excess of the Maximum Interest Rate (Excess), Borrower acknowledge and stipulate that any such charge or receipt shall be the result of an accident and bona fide error, and that any Excess received by Agent or Lender shall be applied, first, to the payment of the then outstanding and unpaid principal hereunder; second to the payment of the other Obligations then outstanding and unpaid; and third, returned to Borrower. All monies paid to Agent and Lender hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, whether at maturity or by prepayment, shall be subject to any rebate of unearned interest as and to the extent required by applicable law.

50





 
of Exhibit F hereto. Borrower shall execute and deliver to Agent a promissory note payable to the order of each Lender (or, if requested by a Lender, to its registered assigns). Thereafter, the Revolving Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
 
4.7                               Taxes.
 
(a)                                 Withholding of Taxes; Gross-Up. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 4.7) the Agent or Lenders receive an amount equal to the sum they would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
 
(b)                                 Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower. Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.
 
(c)                                  Evidence of Payments.

(d)                                 Indemnification by Borrower. Borrower shall indemnify Agent and Lenders, within thirty (30) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by Agent and Lenders or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to Agent and Lenders and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(e)                                  Treatment of Certain Refunds. If Agent determines, in its sole discretion, exercised in good faith, that Agent or Lenders have received a refund of any Taxes as to which they has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 4.7 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 4.7), they shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 4.7 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including
 
51





 
Taxes) of Agent or Lenders and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of Agent, shall repay to Agent and Lenders the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 4.7(e) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that Agent or Lenders are required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.7(e), in no event will Agent and Lenders be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 4.7 the payment of which would place Agent and Lenders in a less favorable net after-Tax position than Agent and Lenders would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section 4.7(e) shall not be construed to require Agent and Lenders to make available their Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that they deem confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

(a)           At any time an Event of Default exists or has occurred and is continuing, and after the applicable cure period, if any, has passed, and Agent has provided the Borrower with a Notice of Acceleration, Agent and the Lenders shall have all rights and remedies provided in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the UCC and other applicable law, all of which rights and remedies may be exercised without further notice to or consent by the Credit Parties, except as such notice or consent is expressly provided for hereunder or required by applicable law. All rights, remedies and powers granted to Agent and Lenders hereunder, under any of the other Loan Documents, the UCC or other applicable law, are cumulative, not exclusive and enforceable, in Agents and Lenders discretion, alternatively, successively, or concurrently on any one or more occasions, and shall include, without limitation, the right to apply to a court of equity for an injunction to restrain a breach or threatened breach by the Credit Parties of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. Agent may (and at the written request of the Required Lenders shall) at any time or times an Event of Default exists or has occurred and is continuing, and the Agent has provided a Notice of Acceleration, proceed directly against the Credit Parties to collect the Obligations without prior recourse to the Collateral.
 
(b)           Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at any time an Event of Default exists or has occurred and is continuing, and after the applicable cure period, if any, has passed, and upon the Agents delivery of a Notice of Acceleration, with the written approval of Required Lenders (which approval (x) shall be deemed to have been given if no response is received by Agent within three (3) Business Days of such approval being requested and (y) shall not be required if Agent determines in its Permitted Discretion that exigent circumstances exist that require the taking of action prior to approval from Required Lenders) Agent may, and at the
 
74





 
written request of the Required Lenders, Agent shall (i) accelerate the payment of all Obligations and demand immediate payment thereof to Agent and Lenders (provided, that, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in Sections 11.1(e) and 11.1(f), all Obligations shall automatically become immediately due and payable), (ii) terminate the commitment of Lenders to make Revolving Loans hereunder whereupon the obligation of Lenders to make any Revolving Loan shall immediately terminate (provided, that, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in Sections 11.1(e) and 11.1(f), the commitments and any other obligation of Agent or Lenders hereunder shall automatically terminate), (iii) cease making Revolving Loans or reduce the lending formulas or amounts of Revolving Loans available to Borrower, (iv) establish such Reserves as Agent determines, without limitation or restriction, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and/or (v) require the Borrower to replace the portfolio manager and Chief Executive Officer of the Borrower with Persons acceptable to the Agent, in its Permitted Discretion.
 
ARTICLE 12 ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS; APPOINTMENT OF AGENT
 
12.1        Assignment and Participations.
 
(a)           Subject to the terms of this Section 12.1, any Lender may make an assignment to a Qualified Assignee of, at any time or times, the Loan Documents, Revolving Loans and any Commitment or any portion thereof or interest therein, including any Lenders rights, title, interests, remedies, powers or duties thereunder. Any assignment by a Lender shall: (i) require the consent of Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed with respect to a Qualified Assignee) and the execution of an Assignment Agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to, and acknowledged by, Agent; (ii) be conditioned on such assignee Lender representing to the assigning Lender and Agent that it is purchasing the applicable Revolving Loans to be assigned to it for its own account, for investment purposes and not with a view to the distribution thereof; (iii) except for an assignment to an Affiliate of such Lender, after giving effect to any such partial assignment the assignee Lender shall have Commitments in an amount at least equal to Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) and the assignor Lender shall have Commitments in an amount at least equal to Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000); (iv) with respect to any assignment of the Revolving Loan Commitment and the Revolving Loan, be for a ratable portion of the assigning Lenders interest in the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount and the Revolving Loan; (v) include a payment to Agent of an assignment fee of three thousand five hundred dollars ($3,500) by assignee Lender; (vi) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, require the consent of Borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that no such consent shall be required for an assignment to a Qualified Assignee; and (vii) unless such an assignment is to an Affiliate of such Lender, Lender shall give notice to the other Lenders of any intent to assign and such other Lenders shall be permitted to purchase such assignment on terms agreed to by assignor Lender and assignee Lender. After the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, any Lender may make an assignment to a non-Qualified Assignee with the consent of the Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If more than one Lender wishes to purchase Revolving Loans or Commitments from the assigning Lender, such assignments to Lenders will be allocated on a pro-rata basis. In the case of an assignment by a Lender under this Section 12.1, the assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment, the same rights, benefits and obligations as all other Lenders hereunder. The assigning Lender shall be relieved of its
 
75





 
obligations hereunder with respect to its Commitments or assigned portion thereof from and after the date of such assignment. The Credit Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that any assignment shall give rise to a direct obligation of the Credit Parties to the assignee and that the assignee shall be considered to be a Lender. In all instances, each Lenders agreement to make Revolving Loans hereunder shall be several and not joint and shall be limited to such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the applicable Commitment. In the event Agent or any Lender assigns or otherwise transfers all or any part of the Obligations, Agent or any such Lender shall so notify Borrower and Borrower shall, upon the request of Agent or such Lender, execute new Revolving Notes in exchange for the Revolving Notes, if any, being assigned. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.1(a), any Lender may at any time pledge the Obligations held by it and such Lenders rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, that, no such pledge to a Federal Reserve Bank shall release such Lender from such Lenders obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document. The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 13.1(a) a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a register of the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitments, and principal amounts thereunder owing to, each Lender from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, prior to the occurrence of a Consent Rights Trigger Event, the Lenders shall not assign any portion of their Commitments, Revolving Loans, rights or responsibilities hereunder to any Disqualified Lender. After the occurrence of a Consent Rights Trigger Event, the Lenders shall be permitted to assign any portion of their Commitments, Revolving Loans, rights or responsibilities hereunder to any Person approved by Agent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
 
(b)           Subject to the terms of this Section 12.1, any Lender may sell to a Qualified Assignee participations in, at any time or times, the Loan Documents, Revolving Loans and any Commitment or any portion thereof or interest therein, including any Lenders rights, title, remedies, powers or duties thereunder. Any participation by a Lender of all or any part of its Commitment shall be made with the understanding that all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if that Lender had not sold such participation, and that the holder of any such participation shall not be entitled to require such Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder except actions directly affecting (i) any reduction in the principal amount of, or interest rate or fees payable with respect to, any Loan in which such holder participates, (ii) any extension of the scheduled amortization of the principal amount of any Loan in which such holder participates or the final maturity date thereof, and (iii) any release of all or substantially all of the Collateral (other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents). Solely for purposes of Section 12.8 (Setoff and Sharing of Payments), Section 3.9 (Increased Cost), Section 4.7 (Taxes), and Section 13.6 (Indemnification), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees that a participation shall give rise to a direct obligation of the Borrower to the participant and the participant shall be considered to be a Lender. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence the Borrower shall not have any obligation or duty to any participant. Neither Agent nor any Lender (other than the Lender selling a participation) shall have any duty to any participant and may continue to deal solely
 
76





 
with the Lender selling a participation as if no such sale had occurred. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, prior to the occurrence of a Consent Rights Trigger Event, the Lenders shall not grant any participations in any portion of their Commitments, Revolving Loans, rights or responsibilities hereunder to any Disqualified Lender. After the occurrence of a Consent Rights Trigger Event, the Lenders shall be permitted to grant participations in any portion of their Commitments, Revolving Loans, rights or responsibilities hereunder to any Person approved by Agent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
 
(c)           Except as expressly provided in this Section 12.1, no Lender shall, as between the Borrower and that Lender, or Agent and that Lender, be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any sale, assignment, transfer or negotiation of, or granting of participation in, all or any part of the Revolving Loans, the Revolving Notes or other Obligations owed to such Lender.
 
(d)           Borrower shall assist any Lender permitted to sell assignments or participations under this Section 12.1 as reasonably required to enable the assigning or selling Lender to effect any such assignment or participation, including the execution and delivery of any and all agreements, notes and other documents and instruments as shall be requested and, if requested by Agent, the preparation of informational materials for, and the participation of management in meetings with, potential assignees or participants. Borrower shall certify the correctness, completeness and accuracy of all descriptions of the Credit Parties and their affairs contained in any selling materials provided by Borrower and all other information provided by Borrower and included in such materials, except that any projections delivered by Borrower shall only be certified by Borrower as having been prepared by Borrower based upon any estimates or assumptions stated therein which Borrower believed to be reasonable and fair in light of the conditions and facts then known to Borrower and that such projections reflected Borrowers good faith and reasonable estimates of the future financial performance of the Credit Parties and of the other information projected therein for the periods set forth therein.
 
(e)           Any Lender may furnish any information concerning the Credit Parties in the possession of such Lender from time to time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and participants), provided, all such prospective assignees and participants shall have signed a confidentiality agreement in form and substance acceptable to Borrower and Agent. After the occurrence of an Event of Default, all such prospective assignees and participants shall have signed a confidentiality agreement in form and substance acceptable to Agent.
 
12.2        Appointment of Agents.
 
(a)           Agent is hereby appointed to act on behalf of all Lenders as Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The provisions of this Section 12.2 are solely for the benefit of Agent and Lenders and neither the Credit Parties nor any other Person shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Agent shall act solely as an agent of Lenders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with or for the Credit Parties or any other Person. Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except for those expressly set forth in this
 
77





 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The duties of Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature and Agent shall not have, or be deemed to have, by reason of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for failure to disclose, any information relating to the Credit Parties, the Portfolio Companies or the Debt Investment Obligors that is communicated to or obtained by Agent in any capacity. Neither Agent nor any of its Affiliates nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives shall be liable to any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or in connection herewith or therewith, provided that Agent may be liable for damages resulting from a breach by Agent of its Obligations hereunder caused by its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 
If Agent shall request instructions from Required Lenders or all affected Lenders with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, then Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until Agent shall have received instructions from Required Lenders or all affected Lenders, as the case may be, and Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (a) if such action would, in the reasonable opinion of Agent, be contrary to law or the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (b) if such action would, in the reasonable opinion of Agent, expose Agent to liability under any Environmental Law (as such term is defined in the Environmental Agreement) or (c) if Agent shall not first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder or under any other Loan Document in accordance with the instructions of Required Lenders or all affected Lenders, as applicable.
 
(b)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any provision of any other Loan Document, the Syndication Agent is named as such for recognition purposes only, and in its capacity as such shall have no duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document; it shall not be entitled to any additional fees as a result of such designation; it being understood and agreed that the Syndication Agent shall be entitled to all indemnification and reimbursement rights in favor of the Agent provided herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Syndication Agent in its capacity as such shall not, by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, have any fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender, Credit Party or any other Person.
 
12.3        Agents Reliance, Etc. Neither Agent nor any of its Affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except that Agent or its Affiliates, as applicable, may be liable for damages caused by its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Agent: (a) may treat the payee of any Revolving Note as the holder thereof until Agent receives written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof signed by such payee and in form reasonably satisfactory to Agent; (b) may consult with legal counsel, independent public
 
78





 
accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (c) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; (d) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents on the part of the Credit Parties or any Guarantor or to inspect the Collateral (including the books and records) of the Credit Parties or any Guarantor; (e) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; and (f) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopy, telegram, cable or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.
 
12.4        Agent and Affiliates. With respect to its Commitments hereunder, Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Agent; and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Agent in its individual capacity. Agent and its Affiliates may lend money to, invest in, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Credit Parties or any Guarantor, any of their Affiliates and any Person who may do business with or own securities of the Credit Parties or any such Affiliate, all as if Agent were not Agent and without any duty to account therefor to Lenders. Agent and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Credit Parties or any Guarantor for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders. Each Lender acknowledges the potential conflict of interest between Agent as a Lender holding disproportionate interests in the Revolving Loans and Agent as Agent. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.
 
12.5        Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender and based on the Financial Statements referred to in Section 7.5 and Section 8.1 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit and financial analysis of the Credit Parties and its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement. Each Lender acknowledges the potential conflict of interest of each other Lender as a result of Lenders holding disproportionate interests in the Revolving Loans, and expressly consents to, and waives any claim based upon, such conflict of interest.
 
12.6        Indemnification. Lenders agree to indemnify Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower or Guarantors and without limiting the obligations of Borrower and Guarantors under the Loan Documents), ratably according to their respective Pro Rata Shares, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on,
 
79





 
incurred by, or asserted against Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any action taken or omitted to be taken by Agent in connection therewith; provided, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement and each other Loan Document, to the extent that Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by Borrower or Guarantors and without limiting the obligations of Borrower and Guarantors under the Loan Documents.
 
12.7        Successor Agent. Agent may resign at any time by giving not less than 30 days prior written notice thereof to Lenders and Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the resigning Agents giving notice of resignation, then the resigning Agent may, on behalf of Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a Lender, if a Lender is willing to accept such appointment, or otherwise shall be a commercial bank or financial institution or a subsidiary of a commercial bank or financial institution if such commercial bank or financial institution is organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and has a combined capital and surplus of at least Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000). If no successor Agent has been appointed pursuant to the foregoing, within 30 days after the date such notice of resignation was given by the resigning Agent, such resignation shall become effective and the Required Lenders shall thereafter perform all the duties of Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided above. Any successor Agent appointed by Required Lenders hereunder shall be subject to the prior written approval of Borrower, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that such approval after the first 30 days after the notice of resignation by the Agent shall not be required if a Consent Rights Triggering Event has occurred and is continuing. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Agent. Upon the earlier of the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent or the effective date of the resigning Agents resignation, the resigning Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, except that any indemnity rights or other rights in favor of such resigning Agent shall continue. After any resigning Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Section 12 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
 
12.8        Setoff and Sharing of Payments. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default and subject to Section 12.9(f), each Lender is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without notice to Borrower or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to offset and to appropriate and to apply any and all balances held by it at any of its offices for the account of Borrower or
 
80





 
any Guarantor (regardless of whether such balances are then due to Borrower or Guarantor) and any other properties or assets at any time held or owing by that Lender or that holder to or for the credit or for the account of Borrower or any Guarantor against and on account of any of the Obligations that are not paid when due. Any Lender exercising a right of setoff or otherwise receiving any payment on account of the Obligations in excess of its Pro Rata Share thereof shall purchase for cash (and the other Lenders or holders shall sell) such participations in each such other Lenders or holders Pro Rata Share of the Obligations as would be necessary to cause such Lender to share the amount so offset or otherwise received with each other Lender or holder in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares (other than offset rights exercised by any Lender with respect to Section 3.9 (Increased Cost), Section 4.7 (Taxes), Section 13.6 (Indemnification)). The Credit Parties agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (a) any Lender may exercise its right to offset with respect to amounts in excess of its Pro Rata Share of the Obligations and may sell participations in such amounts of offset to other Lenders and holders and (b) any Lender so purchasing a participation in the Revolving Loans made or other Obligations held by other Lenders or holders may exercise all rights of offset, bankers Lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender or holder were a direct holder of the Revolving Loans and the other Obligations in the amount of such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if all or any portion of the offset amount or payment otherwise received is thereafter recovered from the Lender that has exercised the right of offset, the purchase of participations by that Lender shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored together with interest at such rate, if any, as such Lender is required to pay to Borrower or such other Person, without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.
 
12.9        Revolving Loans; Payments; Non-Funding Lenders; Defaulting Lenders; Information; Actions in Concert.
 
(a)           Revolving Loans; Payments.
 
(i)            Subject to the satisfaction of the funding conditions hereunder, each Lender shall make the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of each Revolving Loan available to Agent in same day funds by wire transfer to Agents account as set forth in Exhibit D not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the requested borrowing date. After receipt of such wire transfers (or, in the Agents sole discretion, before receipt of such wire transfers), subject to the terms hereof, Agent shall make the requested Revolving Loan to the Borrower on the borrowing date set forth in the applicable Notice of Borrowing. All payments by each Lender shall be made without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind. To the extent that any Lender (a Non-Funding Lender) fails to fund such payments and Revolving Loans or fails to fund the purchase of any required participations, Agent shall be entitled to set off the funding short-fall against that Non-Funding Lenders Pro Rata Share of all payments received from Borrower.
 
(ii)           On the second Business Day of each calendar week or more frequently at Agents election (each, a Reporting Date), Agent shall report to each Lender by telephone, electronic mail, or telecopy of the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of Revolving Loans funded by such Lender since the previous Reporting Date and the amount of principal, interest and fees paid for the benefit of Lenders with respect to the Obligations.
 
81





 
(b)           Availability of Lenders Pro Rata Share. Each Lenders obligation to make its Pro Rata Share of each Revolving Loan shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, other than an inability of Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to borrowing set forth in this Agreement at any time. If such Pro Rata Share is not, in fact, paid to Agent by such Lender when due, Agent will be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender. If any Lender fails to pay the amount of its Pro Rata Share forthwith upon Agents demand, Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and Borrower shall immediately repay such amount to Agent. Nothing in this Section 12.9(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to require Agent to advance funds on behalf of any Lender or to relieve any Revolving Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. To the extent that Agent advances funds to Borrower on behalf of any Lender and is not reimbursed therefor on the same Business Day as such Revolving Loan is made, Agent shall be entitled to retain for its account all interest accrued on such Revolving Loan until reimbursed by the applicable Lender.
 
(c)           Return of Payments.
 
(i)            If Agent pays an amount to a Lender under this Agreement in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received by Agent from Borrower and such related payment is not received by Agent, then Agent will be entitled to recover such amount from such Lender on demand without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.
 
(ii)           If Agent determines at any time that any amount received by Agent under this Agreement must be returned to Borrower or paid to any other Person pursuant to any insolvency law or otherwise, then, notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Lender. In addition, each Lender will repay to Agent on demand any portion of such amount that Agent has distributed to such Lender, together with interest at such rate, if any, as Agent is required to pay to Borrower or such other Person, without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.
 
(d)           Non-Funding Lenders; Defaulting Lenders.
 
(i)            The failure of any Non-Funding Lender to make any Revolving Loan or any payment required by it hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender (each such other Lender, an Other Lender) of its obligations to make such Revolving Loan or purchase such participation on such date, but neither any Other Lender nor Agent shall be responsible for the failure of any Non-Funding Lender to make a Revolving Loan, purchase a participation or make any other payment required hereunder.
 
(ii)           Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, a Defaulting Lender shall not have any voting or consent rights under or with respect to any Loan Document or constitute a Lender (or be included in the calculation of Required Lenders hereunder) for any voting or consent rights under or with respect to any Loan Document. At Borrowers request, Agent or a Person reasonably acceptable to Agent shall have the right with Agents consent and in Agents sole discretion (but shall have no obligation) to purchase from
 
82





 
any Defaulting Lender, and each Defaulting Lender agrees that it shall, at Agents request, sell and assign to Agent or such Person, all of the Commitments of that Defaulting Lender for an amount equal to the principal balance of all Revolving Loans held by such Defaulting Lender and all accrued interest and fees with respect thereto through the date of sale, such purchase and sale to be consummated pursuant to an executed Assignment Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to a Lender that is a Defaulting Lender, the Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, obtain a substitute Lender and execute an Assignment on behalf of such Defaulting Lender at any time with three (3) Business Days prior notice to such Defaulting Lender (unless notice is not practicable under the circumstances) and cause such Lenders Revolving Loans and Commitments to be sold and assigned, in whole or in part, at par.
 
(e)           Dissemination of Information. Agent shall use reasonable efforts to provide Lenders with any notice of Default or Event of Default received by Agent from, or delivered by Agent to, Borrower, with notice of any Event of Default of which Agent has actually become aware and with notice of any action taken by Agent following any Event of Default; provided, that Agent shall not be liable to any Lender for any failure to do so, except to the extent that such failure is attributable to Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. Lenders acknowledge that Borrower is required to provide financial statements, collateral reports and other information to Lenders in accordance with Section 8.1 and agree that Agent shall have no duty to provide the same to Lenders.
 
(f)            Actions in Concert. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, each Lender hereby agrees with each other Lender that no Lender shall take any action to protect or enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement or the Revolving Notes (including exercising any rights of setoff) without first obtaining the prior written consent of Agent and Required Lenders as applicable, it being the intent of Lenders that any such action to protect or enforce rights under this Agreement and the Revolving Notes shall be taken in concert and at the direction or with the consent of Agent or Required Lenders, as applicable, in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
12.10      Amendments and Waivers.
 
(a)           The Credit Parties and, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Agent may, from time to time, enter into written (but not oral) amendments, supplements or modifications hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement, the Revolving Notes or any other Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or of any other party hereunder or thereunder, and with the consent of the Required Lenders, the Agent may execute and deliver to the Borrower a written instrument waiving, on such terms and conditions as the Agent or the Required Lenders may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement, the Revolving Notes or any other Loan Document; provided, however, that no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification shall (i) extend either the Maturity Date or the maturity of any Revolving Note or any installment thereof, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or change the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or change the amount or extend the time of payment of any fee payable to all of the Lenders hereunder, or change the amount of any Lenders commitment to grant Revolving Loans, or amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 4.1(b), Section 8.1 or Section 11 or this Section 12.10, or any changes or modifications to the definition of Required Lenders or

(b)                                 The Credit Parties, Agent, and Lenders irrevocably consent and submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, whichever Agent may elect, and waive any objection based on venue or forum non conveniens with respect to any action instituted therein arising under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or in any way connected with or related or incidental to the dealings of the parties hereto in respect of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions related hereto or thereto, in each case whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise, and agree that any dispute with respect to any such matters shall be heard only in the courts described above (except that Agent shall have the right to bring any action or proceeding against Credit Parties or their property in the courts of any other jurisdiction which Agent deems necessary or appropriate in order to realize on the Collateral or to otherwise enforce its rights against Credit Parties or their property).
 
(c)                                  The Credit Parties hereby waive personal service of any and all process upon them and consent that all such service of process may be made by certified mail (return receipt requested) directed to their address set forth herein and service so made shall be deemed to be completed five (5) days after the same shall have been so deposited in the U.S. mails, or, at Agents option, by service upon the Credit Parties in any other manner provided under the rules of any such courts. Within forty-five (45) days after such service, the Credit Parties shall appear in answer to such process, failing which the Credit Parties shall be deemed in default and judgment may be entered by Agent against the Credit Parties for the amount of the claim and other relief requested.

85





 
(e)                                  Agent and Lenders shall not have any liability to the Credit Parties (whether in tort, contract, equity or otherwise) for losses suffered by the Credit Parties in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to the transactions or relationships contemplated by this Agreement, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection herewith, unless it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment or court order binding on Agent and Lenders that the losses were the result of a breach by Agent or such Lender of its obligations hereunder or an act or omission of Agent or such Lender constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Credit Parties: (i) certify that neither Agent, Lenders, nor any representative, agent or attorney acting for or on behalf Agent or Lenders has represented, expressly or otherwise, that Agent and Lenders would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce any of the waivers provided for in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and (ii) acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Agent and Lenders are relying upon, among other things, the waivers and certifications set forth in this Section 13.2 and elsewhere herein and therein.
 
13.3                        Waiver of Notices. The Credit Parties hereby expressly waive demand, presentment, protest and notice of protest and notice of dishonor with respect to any and all instruments and chattel paper, included in or evidencing any of the Obligations or the Collateral, and any and all other demands and notices of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Obligations, the Collateral and this Agreement, except such as are expressly provided for herein or required by applicable law and cannot be waived thereunder. No notice to or demand on the Credit Parties which Agent may elect to give shall entitle the Credit Parties to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
 
13.4                        Amendments and Waivers. Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated unless such amendment, waiver, discharge or termination is in writing signed by Agent, and as to amendments to any of the Loan Documents, by the Credit Parties, as applicable, and such amendment, waiver, discharge or termination shall be effective and binding as to Agent and Lenders only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. Agent and Lenders shall not, by any act, delay, omission or otherwise be deemed to have expressly or impliedly waived any of its or their rights, powers and/or remedies unless such waiver shall be in writing and signed as provided herein. Any such waiver shall be enforceable only to the extent specifically set forth therein. A waiver by Agent or Lenders of any right, power and/or remedy on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any such right, power and/or remedy which Agent or Lenders would otherwise have on any future occasion, whether similar in kind or otherwise.
 
13.5                        Waiver of Counterclaims. The Credit Parties waive all rights to interpose any claims, deductions, setoffs or counterclaims of any nature (other than compulsory counterclaims) in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, the Obligations, the Collateral or any matter arising therefrom or relating hereto or thereto.
 
13.6                        Indemnification. The Credit Parties shall indemnify and hold Agent and Lenders, and their respective officers, directors, agents, employees, advisors and counsel and their respective Affiliates (each such person being an Indemnitee), harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorneys fees

and expenses) imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any of them in connection with any litigation, investigation, claim or proceeding commenced or threatened related to the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery, enforcement, performance or administration of this Agreement, any other Loan Documents, or any undertaking or proceeding related to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any act, omission, event or transaction related or attendant thereto, including amounts paid in settlement, court costs, and the fees and expenses of counsel except the Credit Parties shall not have any obligation under this Section 13.6 to indemnify an Indemnitee with respect to (i) a matter covered hereby resulting from a breach by such Indemnitee of its obligations hereunder which are the result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined pursuant to a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction (but without limiting the obligations of the Credit Parties as to any other Indemnitee) or (ii) any dispute between any two (2) or more Indemnitees which is not the result of any act or failure to act by the Credit Parties. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in this Section may be unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall pay the maximum portion which they are permitted to pay under applicable law to Agent and Lenders in satisfaction of indemnified matters under this Section. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Credit Parties shall not assert, and the Credit Parties hereby waive, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any undertaking or transaction contemplated hereby. No Indemnitee referred to above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable upon demand. The foregoing indemnity shall survive the payment of the Obligations and the termination or non-renewal of this Agreement.
