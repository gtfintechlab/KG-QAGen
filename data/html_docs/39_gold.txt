change in GAAP that affects in any respect the calculation of any covenant contained in this Agreement or the definition of any term defined under GAAP used in such calculations, Agent, Lenders and Loan Parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend

statements or supplements thereto, attachments to Compliance Certificates and/or calculations regarding financial covenants as Agent may reasonably require in order to provide the appropriate financial information required hereunder with respect to

 The Applicable Margin as of the Closing Date shall be based upon the percentages associated with Level 4
pricing in the pricing grid above, and such Applicable Margin shall remain in effect until the first Adjustment Date occurring after the end of the second full fiscal quarter following the Closing Date. 
If Borrowers shall fail to deliver a Compliance Certificate required under Section 9.8 by the dates required pursuant to such section,
each Applicable Margin shall be conclusively presumed to equal the highest Applicable Margin specified in the pricing table set forth above until the date of delivery of such Compliance Certificate, at which time the rate will be adjusted based upon
the Leverage Ratio reflected in such Compliance Certificate. Notwithstanding 
  3 



anything to the contrary contained herein, no downward adjustment in any Applicable Margin shall be made on any Adjustment Date on which any Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, immediately and automatically upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, each Applicable Margin shall increase to and equal the highest Applicable Margin specified in the
pricing table set forth above and shall continue at such highest Applicable Margin until the date (if any) on which such Event of Default shall be waived in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, at which time the rate will be adjusted
based upon the Leverage Ratio reflected in the most recently delivered Compliance Certificate delivered by Borrowers to Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.8. Any increase in interest rates and/or other fees payable by Borrowers under
this Agreement and the Other Documents pursuant to the provisions of the foregoing sentence shall be in addition to and independent of any increase in such interest rates and/or other fees resulting from the occurrence of any Event of Default
(including, if applicable, any Event of Default arising from a breach of Section 9.9 hereof) and/or the effectiveness of the Default Rate provisions of Section 3.1 hereof or the default fee rate provisions of Section 3.2 hereof. 
If, as a result of any restatement of, or other adjustment to, the Compliance Certificate or for any other reason, Administrative Agent
determines that (a) the Leverage Ratio as previously calculated as of any applicable date for any applicable period was inaccurate, and (b) a proper calculation of the Leverage Ratio for any such period would have resulted in different
pricing for such period, then (i) if the proper calculation of the Leverage Ratio would have resulted in a higher interest rate and/or fees (as applicable) for such period, automatically and immediately without the necessity of any demand or
notice by Administrative Agent or any other affirmative act of any party, the interest accrued on the applicable outstanding Advances and/or the amount of the fees accruing for such period under the provisions of this Agreement and the Other
Documents shall be deemed to be retroactively increased by, and Borrowers shall be obligated to immediately pay to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should
have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period; and (ii) if the proper calculation of the Leverage Ratio would have resulted in a lower interest rate and/or fees (as applicable) for such
period, then the interest accrued on the applicable outstanding Advances and the amount of the fees accruing for such period under the provisions of this Agreement and the Other Documents shall be deemed to remain unchanged, and Administrative Agent
and Lenders shall have no obligation to repay interest or fees to the Borrowers; provided, that, if as a result of any restatement or other event or other determination by Administrative Agent a proper calculation of the Leverage Ratio would have
resulted in a higher interest rate and/or fees (as applicable) for one or more periods and a lower interest rate and/or fees (as applicable) for one or more other periods (due to the shifting of income or expenses from one period to another period
or any other reason), then the amount payable by Borrowers pursuant to clause (i) above shall be based upon the excess, if any, of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for all applicable periods over the amounts of
interest and fees actually paid for such periods.  Application Date shall have the meaning set forth in
Section 2.8(b) hereof.  Approvals shall have the meaning set forth in Section 5.7(b) hereof. 
  4 


Approved Electronic Communication shall mean each notice, demand,
communication, information, document and other material transmitted, posted or otherwise made or communicated by e-mail, E-Fax, the StuckyNet System©, or any other equivalent electronic
service agreed to by Administrative Agent, whether owned, operated or hosted by Administrative Agent, any Lender, any of their Affiliates or any other Person, that any party is obligated to, or otherwise chooses to, provide to Administrative Agent
pursuant to this Agreement or any Other Document, including any financial statement, financial and other report, notice, request, certificate and other information material; provided that Approved Electronic Communications shall not
include any notice, demand, communication, information, document or other material that Administrative Agent specifically instructs a Person to deliver in physical form. 
Authorized Officer shall mean the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Corporate
Controller or Assistant Treasurer of each of the Loan Parties or such other individuals, designated by written notice to the Administrative Agent from the Loan Parties, authorized to execute notices, reports and other documents on behalf of the Loan

successors and assigns.  Base Rate shall mean the base commercial lending rate of PNC as publicly announced to be in
effect from time to time, such rate to be adjusted automatically, without notice, on the effective date of any change in such rate. This rate of interest is determined from time to time by PNC as a means of pricing some loans to its customers and is
neither tied to any external rate of interest or index nor does it necessarily reflect the lowest rate of interest actually charged by PNC to any particular class or category of customers of PNC. 
Benefited Lender shall have the meaning set forth in Section 2.6(e) hereof. 
Blocked Account Bank shall have the meaning set forth in Section 4.8(h) hereof.

Dollars ($5,000,000.00) minus (y) the amount of Uninsured Foreign Receivables included in the Formula Amount, plus 
  41 


(ii) the least of (A) up to sixty-five percent (65%) (the Inventory Advance
Rate) of the sum of the value of the WIP/FG Eligible Inventory, the RM Eligible Inventory and the Supplies/Materials Eligible Inventory, (B) up to eighty-five percent (85%) (the Inventory NOLV Advance Rate, and
together with the Inventory Advance Rate, the Receivables Advance Rate and the Insured Foreign Receivables Advance Rate, collectively, the Advance Rates) of the sum of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of the WIP/FG
Eligible Inventory, the RM Eligible Inventory and the Supplies/Materials Eligible Inventory (as evidenced by an Inventory appraisal satisfactory to Co-Collateral Agents in their sole discretion exercised in good faith) or (C) seventy percent
(70%) of the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount; provided that the amount of availability from Supplies/Materials Eligible Inventory included in any calculation made pursuant to sub-clause (A) or (B) of this clause
(ii) shall not exceed One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00), minus   (iii) the Availability Block; minus 
(iv) the aggregate Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit, minus 
(v) such reserves as Co-Collateral Agents may reasonably deem proper and necessary from time to time in their Permitted Discretion. 
The amount derived from the difference between (x) the sum of Sections 2.1(a)(A)(y)(i) and (ii) minus (y) the sum of
Sections 2.1(a)(A)(y)(iii), (iv) and (v) at any time and from time to time shall be referred to as the Formula Amount. The maximum dollar amount of the Lenders commitment allocations will be based on the Maximum
Revolving Advance Amount.  (B) (i) The Lenders aggregate obligations to make Revolving Advances pursuant to this Agreement (whether
pursuant to clause (A) or (B)) is limited to the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount and (ii) each individual Lenders aggregate obligation to make Revolving Advances pursuant to this Agreement is limited to its Revolving Commitment
Amount.  (C) The Revolving Advances shall be evidenced by one or more secured promissory notes (collectively, the Revolving
Credit Notes) substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the foregoing or otherwise in this Agreement, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Swing Loans
and the Revolving Advances at any one time outstanding shall not exceed an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount less the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit or (ii) the Formula
Amount.  (b) Discretionary Rights. The Advance Rates may be increased or decreased by Co-Collateral Agents at any time and from time
to time in the exercise of their Permitted Discretion. Each Borrower consents to any such increases or decreases and acknowledges that decreasing the Advance Rates or increasing or imposing reserves may limit or restrict Advances requested by
Borrowing Agent. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default or Default, Administrative Agent shall give Borrowing Agent three (3) days prior written notice of its intention to decrease the Advance Rates. The rights of Co-Collateral Agents
under this subsection are subject to the provisions of Section 16.2(b). 
  42 


2.2. Procedures for Requesting Revolving Advances; Procedures for Selection of Applicable
Interest Rates for All Advances.  (a) Borrowing Agent on behalf of any Borrower may notify Administrative Agent prior to 1:00 p.m. on a
Business Day of a Borrowers request to incur, on that day, a Revolving Advance hereunder. Should any amount required to be paid as interest hereunder, or as fees or other charges under this Agreement or any other agreement with Administrative
Agent or Lenders, or with respect to any other Obligation under this Agreement, become due, same shall be deemed a request for a Revolving Advance maintained as a Domestic Rate Loan as of the date such payment is due, in the amount required to pay
in full such interest, fee, charge or Obligation, and such request shall be irrevocable.  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
(a) above, in the event any Borrower desires to obtain a LIBOR Rate Loan for any Advance (other than a Swing Loan), Borrowing Agent shall give Administrative Agent written notice by no later than 1:00 p.m. on the day which is three
(3) Business Days prior to the date such LIBOR Rate Loan is to be borrowed, specifying (i) the date of the proposed borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) the type of borrowing and the amount of such Advance to be borrowed,
which amount shall be in a minimum amount of One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and in integral multiples of Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($500,000.00) thereafter, and (iii) the duration of the first Interest Period
therefor. Interest Periods for LIBOR Rate Loans shall be for one, two or three months; provided that, if an Interest Period would end on a day that is not a Business Day, it shall end on the next succeeding Business Day unless such day falls in the
next succeeding calendar month in which case the Interest Period shall end on the next preceding Business Day. No LIBOR Rate Loan shall be made available to any Borrower during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default. After giving effect
to each requested LIBOR Rate Loan, including those which are converted from a Domestic Rate Loan under Section 2.2(e), there shall not be outstanding more than five (5) LIBOR Rate Loans, in the aggregate. 
(c) Each Interest Period of a LIBOR Rate Loan shall commence on the date such LIBOR Rate Loan is made and shall end on such date as Borrowing
Agent may elect as set forth in subsection (b)(iii) above, provided that the exact length of each Interest Period shall be determined in accordance with the practice of the interbank market for offshore Dollar deposits and no Interest Period shall
end after the last day of the Term.  (d) Borrowing Agent shall elect the initial Interest Period applicable to a LIBOR Rate Loan by its
notice of borrowing given to Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or by its notice of conversion given to Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(e), as the case may be. Borrowing Agent shall elect the duration of each
succeeding Interest Period by giving irrevocable written notice to Administrative Agent of such duration not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day which is three (3) Business Days prior to the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable
to such LIBOR Rate Loan. If Administrative Agent does not receive timely notice of the Interest Period elected by Borrowing Agent, Borrowing Agent shall be deemed to have elected to convert such LIBOR Rate Loan to a Domestic Rate Loan subject to
Section 2.2(e) below. 
  43 


(e) Provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrowing
Agent may, on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period applicable to any outstanding LIBOR Rate Loan, or on any Business Day with respect to Domestic Rate Loans, convert any such loan into a loan of another type in the same
aggregate principal amount provided that any conversion of a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be made only on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan. If Borrowing Agent desires to convert a loan, Borrowing
Agent shall give Administrative Agent written notice by no later than 1:00 p.m. (i) on the day which is three (3) Business Days prior to the date on which such conversion is to occur with respect to a conversion from a Domestic Rate Loan
to a LIBOR Rate Loan, or (ii) on the day which is one (1) Business Day prior to the date on which such conversion is to occur (which date shall be the last Business Day of the Interest Period for the applicable LIBOR Rate Loan) with
respect to a conversion from a LIBOR Rate Loan to a Domestic Rate Loan, specifying, in each case, the date of such conversion, the loans to be converted and if the conversion is to a LIBOR Rate Loan, the duration of the first Interest Period
therefor.  (f) At its option and upon written notice given prior to 1:00 p.m. at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of
such prepayment, any Borrower may, subject to Section 2.2(g) hereof, prepay the LIBOR Rate Loans in whole at any time or in part from time to time with accrued interest on the principal being prepaid to the date of such repayment. Such Borrower
shall specify the date of prepayment of Advances which are LIBOR Rate Loans and the amount of such prepayment. In the event that any prepayment of a LIBOR Rate Loan is required or permitted on a date other than the last Business Day of the then
current Interest Period with respect thereto, such Borrower shall indemnify Administrative Agent and Lenders therefor in accordance with Section 2.2(g) hereof. The Borrowers shall also have the right at any time after the Closing Date upon five
(5) days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent to permanently reduce the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount (by ratably reducing the current Lenders Revolving Commitment Amounts in proportion to their Revolving Commitment
Percentages) in a minimum amount of Ten Million and 00/100 Dollars ($10,000,000.00) and whole multiples of Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00); provided that any such reduction shall be accompanied by prepayment of the Revolving
Credit Notes, together with outstanding Facility Fees, and the full amount of interest accrued on the principal sum to be prepaid (and all amounts referred to in Section 2.2(g) hereof) to the extent necessary so that the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of Swing Loans and the Revolving Advances at any one time outstanding shall not exceed an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount as so reduced less the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding
Letters of Credit or (ii) the Formula Amount.  (g) Each Borrower shall indemnify Administrative Agent and Lenders and hold
Administrative Agent and Lenders harmless from and against any and all losses or expenses that Administrative Agent and Lenders may sustain or incur as a consequence of any prepayment, conversion of or any default by any Borrower in the payment of
the principal of or interest on any LIBOR Rate Loan or failure by any Borrower to complete a borrowing of, a prepayment of or conversion of or to a LIBOR Rate Loan after notice thereof has been given,

  44 



including, but not limited to, any interest payable by Administrative Agent or Lenders to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder. A
certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by Administrative Agent or any Lender to Borrowing Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(h) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any Applicable Law, treaty, regulation or directive, or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, including without limitation any Change in Law, shall make it unlawful for Lenders or any Lender (for purposes of this subsection (h), the term Lender shall include any Lender and the office or
branch where any Lender or any Person controlling such Lender makes or maintains any LIBOR Rate Loans) to make or maintain its LIBOR Rate Loans, the obligation of Lenders (or such affected Lender) to make LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder shall forthwith
be cancelled and Borrowers shall, if any affected LIBOR Rate Loans are then outstanding, promptly upon request from Administrative Agent, either pay all such affected LIBOR Rate Loans or convert such affected LIBOR Rate Loans into loans of another
type. If any such payment or conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loan is made on a day that is not the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan, Borrowers shall pay Administrative Agent, upon Administrative Agents request,
such amount or amounts set forth in clause (g) above. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by Lenders to Borrowing Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
2.3. Term Loan.  Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Lender, severally and not jointly, will make a term loan to Borrowers in the sum equal to such Lenders Term Loan Commitment Percentage of Thirty Million and 00/100 Dollars ($30,000,000.00)
(the Term Loan). The Term Loan shall be advanced on the Closing Date and shall be, with respect to principal, payable in equal quarterly installments each in the amount of One Million Seventy-One Thousand Four Hundred Twenty-Eight
and 58/100 Dollars ($1,071,428.58), which installments are due and payable by the Borrowers commencing on April 1, 2016 and on the first day of each fiscal quarter thereafter with the balance payable upon the last day of the Term, subject to
acceleration upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under this Agreement or termination of this Agreement. The Term Loan shall be evidenced by one or more secured promissory notes (collectively, the Term Notes) in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 2.3. The Term Loan may consist of Domestic Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, or a combination thereof, as Borrowing Agent may request. In the event that Borrowers desire to obtain or
extend a Eurodollar Rate Loan or to convert a Domestic Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, Borrowing Agent shall comply with the notification requirements set forth in Sections 2.2(b) and (d) and the provisions of Sections 2.2(b)
through (g) shall apply. The Term Loan Commitment of each Lender shall terminate after such Lender advances its Term Loan Commitment Percentage of the Term Loan on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
  45 


2.4. Swing Loans. 
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in order to minimize the transfer of funds between Lenders and
Administrative Agent for administrative convenience, Administrative Agent, Lenders holding Revolving Commitments and Swing Loan Lender agree that in order to facilitate the administration of this Agreement, Swing Loan Lender may, at its election and
option made in its sole discretion cancelable at any time for any reason whatsoever, make swing loan advances (Swing Loans) available to Borrowers as provided for in this Section 2.4 at any time or from time to time after the
date hereof to, but not including, the expiration of the Term, in an aggregate principal amount up to but not in excess of the Maximum Swing Loan Advance Amount, provided that the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Swing Loans and the
Revolving Advances at any one time outstanding shall not exceed an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount, less the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit or (B) the Formula Amount. All
Swing Loans to the Borrowers shall be in Dollars and shall be Domestic Rate Loans only. Borrowers may borrow (at the option and election of Swing Loan Lender), repay and reborrow (at the option and election of Swing Loan Lender) Swing Loans and
Swing Loan Lender may make Swing Loans as provided in this Section 2.4 during the period between Settlement Dates. All Swing Loans shall be evidenced by a secured promissory note (the Swing Loan Note) substantially in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit 2.4(a). Swing Loan Lenders agreement to make Swing Loans under this Agreement is cancelable at any time for any reason whatsoever and the making of Swing Loans by Swing Loan Lender from time to time
shall not create any duty or obligation, or establish any course of conduct, pursuant to which Swing Loan Lender shall thereafter be obligated to make Swing Loans in the future. 
(b) Upon either (i) any request by Borrowing Agent for a Revolving Advance made pursuant to Section 2.2(a) hereof or (ii) the
occurrence of any deemed request by Borrowers for a Revolving Advance pursuant to the provisions of the last sentence of Section 2.2(a) hereof, Swing Loan Lender may elect, in its sole discretion, to have such request or deemed request treated
as a request for a Swing Loan, and may advance same day funds to Borrowers as a Swing Loan; provided that notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided for herein, Swing Loan Lender may not make Swing Loan Advances if Swing Loan Lender has been
notified by Administrative Agent or by Required Lenders that one or more of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 8.2 of this Agreement have not been satisfied or the Revolving Commitments have been terminated for any reason. 
(c) Upon the making of a Swing Loan (whether before or after the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default and regardless of whether a
Settlement has been requested with respect to such Swing Loan), each Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from Swing Loan Lender, without recourse or warranty, an
undivided interest and participation in such Swing Loan in proportion to its Revolving Commitment Percentage. Swing Loan Lender or Administrative Agent may, at any time, require the Lenders holding Revolving Commitments to fund such participations
by means of a Settlement as provided for in Section 2.6(d) below. From and after the date, if any, on which any Lender is required to fund, and funds, its participation in any Swing Loans purchased hereunder, Administrative Agent shall promptly
distribute to such Lender its Revolving Commitment Percentage of all payments of principal and interest and all 
  46 



proceeds of Collateral received by Administrative Agent in respect of such Swing Loan; provided that no Lender shall be obligated in any event to make Revolving Advances in an amount in excess of
its Revolving Commitment Amount minus its Participation Commitment (taking into account any reallocations under Section 2.22) of the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit. 
2.5. Disbursement of Advance Proceeds. 
All Advances shall be disbursed from whichever office or other place Administrative Agent may designate from time to time and, together with
any and all other Obligations of Borrowers to Administrative Agent or Lenders, shall be charged to Borrowers Account on Administrative Agents books. The proceeds of each Revolving Advance or Swing Loan requested by Borrowing Agent on
behalf of any Borrower or deemed to have been requested by any Borrower under Sections 2.2(a), 2.6(b) or 2.14 hereof shall, (i) with respect to requested Revolving Advances, to the extent Lenders make such Revolving Advances in accordance with
Section 2.2(a), 2.6(b) or 2.14 hereof, and with respect to Swing Loans made upon any request by Borrowing Agent for a Revolving Advance to the extent Swing Loan Lender makes such Swing Loan in accordance with Section 2.4(b) hereof, be made
available to the applicable Borrower on the day so requested by way of credit to such Borrowers operating account at PNC, or such other bank as Borrowing Agent may designate following notification to Administrative Agent, in immediately
available federal funds or other immediately available funds or, (ii) with respect to Revolving Advances deemed to have been requested by any Borrower or Swing Loans made upon any deemed request for a Revolving Advance by any Borrower, be
disbursed to Administrative Agent to be applied to the outstanding Obligations giving rise to such deemed request. During the Term, Borrowers may use the Revolving Advances and Swing Loans by borrowing, prepaying and reborrowing, all in accordance
with the terms and conditions hereof.  2.6. Making and Settlement of Advances. 
(a) Each borrowing of Revolving Advances shall be advanced according to the applicable Revolving Commitment Percentages of Lenders (subject to
any contrary terms of Section 2.22). The Term Loan shall be advanced according to the applicable Term Loan Commitment Percentages of Lenders. Each borrowing of Swing Loans shall be advanced by Swing Loan Lender alone. 
(b) Promptly after receipt by Administrative Agent of a request or a deemed request for a Revolving Advance pursuant to Section 2.2(a)
and, with respect to Revolving Advances, to the extent Administrative Agent elects not to provide a Swing Loan or the making of a Swing Loan would result in the aggregate amount of all outstanding Swing Loans exceeding the maximum amount permitted
in Section 2.4(a), Administrative Agent shall notify Lenders of its receipt of such request specifying the information provided by Borrowing Agent and the apportionment among Lenders of the requested Revolving Advance as determined by
Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Lender shall remit the principal amount of each Revolving Advance to Administrative Agent such that Administrative Agent is able to, and Administrative Agent shall, to the extent the
applicable Lenders have made funds available to it for such purpose and subject to Section 8.2, fund such Revolving Advance to the Borrowers in Dollars and immediately available funds at the Payment Office prior to the close of

  47 



business, on the applicable borrowing date; provided that if any Lender fails to remit such funds to Administrative Agent in a timely manner, Administrative Agent may elect in its sole
discretion to fund with its own funds the Revolving Advance of such Lender on such borrowing date, and such Lender shall be subject to the repayment obligation in Section 2.6(c) hereof. 
(c) Unless Administrative Agent shall have been notified by telephone, confirmed in writing, by any Lender that such Lender will not make the
amount which would constitute its applicable Revolving Commitment Percentage of the requested Revolving Advance available to Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) assume that such Lender has made such amount
available to Administrative Agent on such date in accordance with Section 2.6(b) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrowers a corresponding amount. Administrative Agent will promptly notify Borrowing Agent of its
receipt of any such notice from a Lender. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its applicable Revolving Commitment Percentage of the requested Revolving Advance available to Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and Borrowers
severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to Borrowers through but excluding the date of payment to Administrative
Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of (A) (x) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days) during such period as quoted by Administrative
Agent, times (y) such amount or (B) a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by Borrower, the Revolving Interest Rate
for Revolving Advances that are Domestic Rate Loans. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Revolving Advance to Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Revolving Advance. Any payment by Borrowers
shall be without prejudice to any claim Borrowers may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to Administrative Agent. A certificate of Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender or Borrower with respect to any amounts
owing under this paragraph (c) shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error.  (d) Administrative Agent, on behalf of Swing
Loan Lender, shall demand settlement (a Settlement) of all or any Swing Loans with Lenders on at least a weekly basis, or on any more frequent date that Administrative Agent elects or that Swing Loan Lender at its option
exercisable for any reason whatsoever may request, by notifying Lenders of such requested Settlement by facsimile, telephonic or electronic transmission no later than 2:00 p.m. on the date of such requested Settlement (the Settlement
Date). Subject to any contrary provisions of Section 2.22, each Lender shall transfer the amount of such Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage of the outstanding principal amount (plus interest accrued thereon to the extent
requested by Administrative Agent) of the applicable Swing Loan with respect to which Settlement is requested by Administrative Agent, to such account of Administrative Agent as Administrative Agent may designate not later than 5:00 p.m. on such
Settlement Date if requested by Administrative Agent by 2:00 p.m., otherwise not later than 5:00 p.m. on the next Business Day. Settlements may occur at any time notwithstanding that the conditions precedent to making Revolving Advances set forth in
Section 8.2 have not been satisfied or the Revolving Commitments shall have otherwise been terminated at such time. All amounts so transferred to Administrative Agent shall be applied against the amount of outstanding Swing Loans and, when so
applied shall constitute Revolving Advances of such Lenders accruing interest as Domestic Rate Loans. If any such amount is not transferred to Administrative Agent by any Lender on such Settlement Date, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon as specified in Section 2.6(c). 
  48 


(e) If any Lender or Participant (a Benefited Lender) shall at any time
receive any payment of all or part of its Advances, or interest thereon, or receive any Collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by set-off) in a greater proportion than any such payment to and Collateral received by
any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lenders Advances, or interest thereon, and such greater proportionate payment or receipt of Collateral is not expressly permitted hereunder, such Benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from
the other Lenders a participation in such portion of each such other Lenders Advances, or shall provide such other Lender with the benefits of any such Collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefited Lender
to share the excess payment or benefits of such Collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the other Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefited Lender, such
purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that
each Lender so purchasing a portion of another Lenders Advances may exercise all rights of payment (including rights of set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion, and the
obligations owing to each such purchasing Lender in respect of such participation and such purchased portion of any other Lenders Advances shall be part of the Obligations secured by the Collateral, and the obligations owing to each such
purchasing Lender in respect of such participation and such purchased portion of any other Lenders Advances shall be part of the Obligations secured by the Collateral. 
2.7. Maximum Advances. 
The aggregate balance of Revolving Advances plus Swing Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed the lesser of (a) the Maximum
Revolving Advance Amount less the aggregate Maximum Undrawn Amount of all issued and outstanding Letters of Credit or (b) the Formula Amount. 
2.8. Manner and Repayment of Advances. 
(a) The Revolving Advances and Swing Loans shall be due and payable in full on the last day of the Term subject to earlier prepayment as herein
provided. The Term Loan shall be due and payable as provided in Section 2.3 hereof and shall be due and payable in full on the last day of the Term, subject to mandatory prepayments as herein provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all
Advances shall be subject to earlier repayment upon (x) acceleration upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under this Agreement or (y) termination of this Agreement. Each payment (including each prepayment) by any Borrower on account
of the principal of and interest on the Advances (other than the Term Loan) shall be applied, first to the outstanding Swing Loans and next, pro rata according to the applicable Revolving Commitment Percentages of Lenders, to the outstanding
Revolving Advances (subject to any contrary provisions of 
  49 



Section 2.22). Each payment (including each prepayment) by any Borrower on account of the principal of and interest on the Term Loan shall be applied to the Term Loan pro rata according to
the Term Loan Commitment Percentages of the Lenders in the inverse order of maturities thereof.  (b) Each Borrower recognizes that the
amounts evidenced by checks, notes, drafts or any other items of payment relating to and/or proceeds of Collateral may not be collectible by Administrative Agent on the date received by Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent shall conditionally
credit Borrowers Account for each item of payment on the next Business Day after the Business Day on which such item of payment is received by Administrative Agent (and the Business Day on which each such item of payment is so credited shall
be referred to, with respect to such item, as the Application Date). Administrative Agent is not, however, required to credit Borrowers Account for the amount of any item of payment which is unsatisfactory to Administrative
Agent and Administrative Agent may charge Borrowers Account for the amount of any item of payment which is returned, for any reason whatsoever, to Administrative Agent unpaid. Subject to the foregoing, Borrowers agree that for purposes of
computing the interest charges under this Agreement, each item of payment received by Administrative Agent shall be deemed applied by Administrative Agent on account of the Obligations on its respective Application Date. Borrowers further agree that
there is a monthly float charge payable to Administrative Agent for Administrative Agents sole benefit, in an amount equal to (y) the face amount of all items of payment received during the prior month (including items of payment received
by Administrative Agent as a wire transfer or electronic depository check) multiplied by (z) the Revolving Interest Rate with respect to Domestic Rate Loans for one (1) Business Day. All proceeds received by Administrative Agent shall be
applied to the Obligations in accordance with Section 4.8(h).  (c) All payments of principal, interest and other amounts payable
hereunder, or under any of the Other Documents shall be made to Administrative Agent at the Payment Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the due date therefor in Dollars in federal funds or other funds immediately available to Administrative Agent.
Administrative Agent shall have the right to effectuate payment of any and all Obligations due and owing hereunder by charging Borrowers Account or by making Advances as provided in Section 2.2 hereof. 
(d) Except as expressly provided herein, all payments (including prepayments) to be made by any Borrower on account of principal, interest,
fees and other amounts payable hereunder shall be made without deduction, setoff or counterclaim and shall be made to Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders to the Payment Office, in each case on or prior to 1:00 p.m., in Dollars and in
immediately available funds.  2.9. Repayment of Excess Advances. 
If at any time the aggregate balance of outstanding Revolving Advances, Swing Loans, Term Loans and/or Advances taken as a whole exceeds the
maximum amount of such type of Advances and/or Advances taken as a whole (as applicable) permitted hereunder, such excess Advances shall be immediately due and payable without the necessity of any demand, at the Payment Office, whether or not a
Default or an Event of Default has occurred. 
  50 


2.10. Statement of Account. 
Administrative Agent shall maintain, in accordance with its customary procedures, a separate sub-loan account for the Borrowers (the
Borrowers Account) in the name of the Borrowers in which shall be recorded the date and amount of each Advance made by Administrative Agent or Lenders and the date and amount of each payment in respect thereof; provided,
however, the failure by Administrative Agent to record the date and amount of any Advance shall not adversely affect Administrative Agent or any Lender. Each month, Administrative Agent shall send to Borrowing Agent a statement showing the
accounting for the Advances made, payments made or credited in respect thereof, and other transactions between Administrative Agent, Lenders and Borrowers during such month. The monthly statements shall be deemed correct and binding upon Borrowers
in the absence of manifest error and shall constitute an account stated between Lenders and Borrowers unless Administrative Agent receives a written statement of Borrowers specific exceptions thereto within thirty (30) days after such
statement is received by Borrowing Agent. The records of Administrative Agent with respect to Borrowers Account shall be conclusive evidence absent manifest error of the amounts of Advances and other charges thereto and of payments applicable
thereto.  2.11. Letters of Credit. 
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Issuer shall issue or cause the issuance of letters of credit denominated in Dollars for the
account of any Borrower (collectively, Letters of Credit), except to the extent that the issuance thereof would then cause the sum of (i) the outstanding Revolving Advances plus (ii) the outstanding Swing Loans, plus
(iii) the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit, plus (iv) the Maximum Undrawn Amount of the Letter of Credit to be issued to exceed the lesser of (x) the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount or (y) the Formula
Amount (calculated without giving effect to the deductions provided for in Section 2.1(a)(A)(y)((iv) in the Formula Amount). The Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit shall not exceed in the aggregate at any time the
Letter of Credit Sublimit. All disbursements or payments related to Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be Domestic Rate Loans consisting of Revolving Advances and shall bear interest at the Revolving Interest Rate for Domestic Rate Loans. Letters
of Credit that have not been drawn upon shall not bear interest (but fees shall accrue 

under) not in effect on the date of this Agreement, or shall impose upon Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not
applicable on the date of this Agreement, and which Issuer in good faith deems material to it, or (ii) the issuance of the Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally. 
  51 


(c) As of the Closing Date, (i) the Existing Letters of Credit will be deemed to have been
issued as, and be, Letters of Credit under this Agreement, and (ii) the Existing Letters of Credit and the reimbursement obligations in respect thereof will be Indebtedness under this Agreement and will no longer be Indebtedness under the
Existing Credit Agreement. In accordance with the foregoing, from and after the Closing Date all fees and other charges payable with respect to the Existing Letters of Credit will be determined in accordance with Section 3.2(a) of this
Agreement.  2.12. Issuance of Letters of Credit. 
(a) Borrowing Agent, on behalf of any Borrower, may request Issuer to issue or cause the issuance of a Letter of Credit by delivering to
Issuer, with a copy to Administrative Agent at the Payment Office, prior to 1:00 p.m., at least five (5) Business Days prior to the proposed date of issuance, such Issuers form of Letter of Credit Application (the Letter of
Credit Application) completed to the satisfaction of Administrative Agent and Issuer; and, such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as Administrative Agent or Issuer may reasonably request. Issuer shall not issue
any requested Letter of Credit if such Issuer has received notice from Administrative Agent or any Lender that one or more of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 8.2 of this Agreement have not been satisfied or the commitments of
Lenders to make Revolving Advances hereunder have been terminated for any reason.  (b) Each Letter of Credit shall, among other things,
(i) provide for the payment of sight drafts, or other written demands for payment, or acceptances of usance drafts when presented for honor thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof and when accompanied by the documents described therein
and (ii) have an expiry date not later than twelve (12) months after such Letter of Credits date of issuance and in no event later than the last day of the Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the expiry date of a Letter of
Credit may be up to one (1) year later than the last day of the Term if the Loan Parties Cash Collateralize each such Letter of Credit having an expiry date later than the last day of the Term on or before the thirtieth (30th) day prior to the last day of the Term; and (B) at the discretion of the Issuer, any Letter of Credit (other than a Letter of Credit which expires later than the last day 

y renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension), subject however to the Cash Collateral requirement in clause (A) above
in the event any such renewal would result in a Letter of Credit which expires later than the last day of the Term. Each standby Letter of Credit shall be subject either to the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits as most recently
published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time a Letter of Credit is issued (the UCP) or the International Standby Practices (International Chamber of Commerce Publication Number 590) (the ISP98
Rules), or any subsequent revision thereof at the time a standby Letter of Credit is issued, as determined by Issuer, and each trade Letter of Credit shall be subject to the UCP. In addition, no trade Letter of Credit may permit the
presentation of an ocean bill of lading that includes a condition that the original bill of lading is not required to claim the goods shipped thereunder. 
(c) Administrative Agent shall use its reasonable efforts to notify Lenders of the request by Borrowing Agent for a Letter of Credit hereunder.

  52 


2.13. Requirements For Issuance of Letters of Credit. 
(a) Borrowing Agent shall authorize and direct any Issuer to name the applicable Borrower as the Applicant or Account
Party of each Letter of Credit. If Administrative Agent is not the Issuer of any Letter of Credit, Borrowing Agent shall authorize and direct Issuer to deliver to Administrative Agent all instruments, documents, and other writings and property
received by Issuer pursuant to the Letter of Credit and to accept and rely upon Administrative Agents instructions and agreements with respect to all matters arising in connection with the Letter of Credit, the application therefor. 
(b) In connection with all trade Letters of Credit issued or caused to be issued by Issuer under this Agreement, each Borrower hereby appoints
Issuer, or its designee, as its attorney, with full power and authority if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing: (i) to sign and/or endorse such Borrowers name upon any warehouse or other receipts, and acceptances;
(ii) to sign such Borrowers name on bills of lading; (iii) to clear Inventory through the United States of America Customs Department (Customs) in the name of such Borrower or Issuer or Issuers designee, and
to sign and deliver to Customs officials powers of attorney in the name of such Borrower for such purpose; and (iv) to complete in such Borrowers name or Issuers, or in the name of Issuers designee, any order, sale or
transaction, obtain the necessary documents in connection therewith, and collect the proceeds thereof. Neither Administrative Agent, Issuer nor their attorneys will be liable for any acts or omissions nor for any error of judgment or mistakes of
fact or law, except for Administrative Agents, Issuers or their respective attorneys willful misconduct. This power, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable as long as any Letters of Credit remain outstanding. 
2.14. Disbursements, Reimbursement. 
(a) Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
to, purchase from Issuer a participation in each Letter of Credit and each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to such Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage of the Maximum Undrawn Amount of such Letter of Credit (as in effect from time to
time) and the amount of such drawing, respectively.  (b) In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the
beneficiary or transferee thereof, Issuer will promptly notify Administrative Agent and Borrowing Agent. Regardless of whether Borrowing Agent shall have received such notice, Borrowers shall reimburse (such obligation to reimburse Issuer shall
sometimes be referred to as a Reimbursement Obligation) Issuer prior to 12:00 Noon, on each date that an amount is paid by Issuer under any Letter of Credit (each such date, a Drawing Date) in an amount equal to
the amount so paid by Issuer. In the event Borrowers fail to reimburse Issuer for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 Noon, on the Drawing Date, Issuer will promptly notify Administrative Agent and each Lender thereof,
and Borrowers shall be automatically deemed to have requested that a Revolving Advance maintained as a Domestic Rate Loan be made by Lenders to be disbursed on the Drawing Date under such Letter of Credit, and Lenders shall be unconditionally
obligated to fund such Revolving Advance (all whether or not the conditions specified in Section 8.2 are then satisfied or the commitments of Lenders to make Revolving Advances hereunder have been terminated for any reason) as provided for in
Section 2.14(c) immediately below. Any notice given by Issuer pursuant to this Section 2.14(b) may be oral if promptly confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such a confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding
effect of such notice. 
  53 


(c) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.14(b) make available to Issuer
through Administrative Agent at the Payment Office an amount in immediately available funds equal to its Revolving Commitment Percentage (subject to any contrary provisions of Section 2.22) of the amount of the drawing, whereupon the
participating Lenders shall (subject to Section 2.14(d)) each be deemed to have made a Revolving Advance maintained as a Domestic Rate Loan to Borrowers in that amount. If any Lender so notified fails to make available to Administrative Agent,
for the benefit of Issuer, the amount of such Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage of such amount by 2:00 p.m. on the Drawing Date, then interest shall accrue on such Lenders obligation to make such payment, from the Drawing Date to
the date on which such Lender makes such payment (i) at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate during the first three (3) days following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to
Revolving Advances maintained as a Domestic Rate Loan on and after the fourth day following the Drawing Date. Administrative Agent and Issuer will promptly give notice of the occurrence of the Drawing Date, but failure of Administrative Agent or
Issuer to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Lender from its obligations under this Section 2.14(c), provided that such Lender shall not
be obligated to pay interest as provided in Section 2.14(c)(i) and (ii) until and commencing from the date of receipt of notice from Administrative Agent or Issuer of a drawing. 
(d) With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not converted into a Revolving Advance maintained as a Domestic Rate Loan to Borrowers in
whole or in part as contemplated by Section 2.14(b), because of the Loan Parties failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 hereof (other than any notice requirements) or for any other reason, Borrowers shall be
deemed to have incurred from Administrative Agent a borrowing (each a Letter of Credit Borrowing) in the amount of such drawing. Such Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall
bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to a Revolving Advance maintained as a Domestic Rate Loan. Each Lenders payment to Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.14(c) shall be deemed to be a payment in respect of its
participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing and shall constitute a Participation Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its Participation Commitment in respect of the applicable Letter of Credit under this
Section 2.14.  (e) Each Lenders Participation Commitment in respect of the Letters of Credit shall continue until the last to
occur of any of the following events: (x) Issuer ceases to be obligated to issue or cause to be issued Letters of Credit hereunder; (y) no Letter of Credit issued or created hereunder remains outstanding and uncancelled; and (z) all
Persons (other than the Loan Parties) have been fully reimbursed for all payments made under or relating to Letters of Credit. 
  54 


2.15. Repayment of Participation Advances. 
(a) Upon (and only upon) receipt by Administrative Agent for the account of Issuer of immediately available funds from the Loan Parties
(i) in reimbursement of any payment made by Issuer or Administrative Agent under the Letter of Credit with respect to which any Lender has made a Participation Advance to Agent, or (ii) in payment of interest on such a payment made by
Issuer or Agent under such a Letter of Credit, Agent will pay to each Lender, in the same funds as those received by Administrative Agent, the amount of such Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage of such funds, except Administrative Agent
shall retain the amount of the Revolving Commitment Percentage of such funds of any Lender that did not make a Participation Advance in respect of such payment by Administrative Agent (and, to the extent that any of the other Lender(s) holding the
Revolving Commitment have funded any portion such Defaulting Lenders Participation Advance in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.22, Administrative Agent will pay over to such Non-Defaulting Lenders a pro rata portion of the
funds so withheld from such Defaulting Lender).  (b) If Issuer or Administrative Agent is required at any time to return to any Loan Party,
or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any official in any insolvency proceeding, any portion of the payments made by Borrowers or any other Loan Party to Issuer or Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.15(a) in reimbursement
of a payment made under the Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon, each applicable Lender shall, on demand of Administrative Agent, forthwith return to Issuer or Administrative Agent the amount of its Revolving Commitment Percentage of any
amounts so returned by Issuer or Administrative Agent plus interest at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.  2.16. Documentation. 
Each Borrower agrees to be bound by the terms of the Letter of Credit Application and by Issuers interpretations of any Letter of Credit
issued on behalf of such Borrower and by Issuers written regulations and customary practices relating to letters of credit, though Issuers interpretations may be different from such Borrowers own. In the event of a conflict between
the Letter of Credit Application and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. It is understood and agreed that, except in the case of (A) gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final
non-appealable judgment) or (B) the wrongful dishonor by the Issuer or any of Issuers Affiliates of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of Credit, except if such dishonor resulted from any act or omission, whether rightful
or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto government or government authority, Issuer shall not be liable for any error, negligence and/or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following Borrowing Agents or any
Borrowers instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any modifications, amendments or supplements thereto.  2.17.
Determination to Honor Drawing Request.  In determining whether to honor any request for drawing under any Letter of Credit by the
beneficiary thereof, Issuer shall be responsible only to determine that the documents and certificates required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter
of Credit and that any other drawing condition appearing on the face of such Letter of Credit has been satisfied in the manner so set forth. 
  55 


2.18. Nature of Participation and Reimbursement Obligations. 
The obligation of each Lender in accordance with this Agreement to make the Revolving Advances or Participation Advances as a result of a
drawing under a Letter of Credit, and the obligations of Borrowers to reimburse Issuer upon a draw under a Letter of Credit, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Section 2.18 under all circumstances, including the following circumstances:  (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or
other right which such Lender or any Loan Party, as the case may be, may have against Issuer, Administrative Agent, any Borrower, any other Loan Party or Lender, as the case may be, or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; 
(ii) the failure of any Borrower or any other Person to comply, in connection with a Letter of Credit Borrowing, with the conditions set forth
in this Agreement for the making of a Revolving Advance, it being acknowledged that such conditions are not required for the making of a Letter of Credit Borrowing and the obligation of Lenders to make Participation Advances under Section 2.14;
 (iii) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit; 
(iv) any claim of breach of warranty that might be made by any Loan Party, Administrative Agent, Issuer or any Lender against the beneficiary
of a Letter of Credit, or the existence of any claim, set-off, recoupment, counterclaim, cross-claim, defense or other right which any Loan Party, Administrative Agent, Issuer or any Lender may have at any time against a beneficiary, any successor
beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit or assignee of the proceeds thereof (or any Persons for whom any such transferee or assignee may be acting), Issuer, Administrative Agent or any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection
with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any underlying transaction between any Loan Party or any Subsidiaries of such Loan Party and the beneficiary for which any Letter of Credit was
procured);  (v) the lack of power or authority of any signer of (or any defect in or forgery of any signature or endorsement on) or the
form of or lack of validity, sufficiency, accuracy, enforceability or genuineness of any draft, demand, instrument, certificate or other document presented under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, or any fraud or alleged fraud in connection
with any Letter of Credit, or the transport of any property or provision of services relating to a Letter of Credit, in each case even if Issuer or any of Issuers Affiliates has been notified thereof; 
(vi) payment by Issuer under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document which is forged or
does not fully comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit (provided that the foregoing shall not excuse Issuer from any obligation under the terms of any applicable Letter of Credit to require the presentation of documents that on their face
appear to satisfy any applicable requirements for drawing under such Letter of Credit prior to honoring or paying any such draw); 
  56 


(vii) the solvency of, or any acts or omissions by, any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit, or
any other Person having a role in any transaction or obligation relating to a Letter of Credit, or the existence, nature, quality, quantity, condition, value or other characteristic of any property or services relating to a Letter of Credit; 
(viii) any failure by Issuer or any of Issuers Affiliates to issue any Letter of Credit in the form requested by Borrowing Agent, unless
Administrative Agent and Issuer have each received written notice from Borrowing Agent of such failure within three (3) Business Days after Issuer shall have furnished Administrative Agent and Borrowing Agent a copy of such Letter of Credit and
such error is material and no drawing has been made thereon prior to receipt of such notice;  (ix) the occurrence of any Material Adverse
Effect;  (x) any breach of this Agreement or any Other Document by any party thereto; 
(xi) the occurrence or continuance of an insolvency proceeding with respect to any Borrower or any Guarantor; 
(xii) the fact that a Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; 
(xiii) the fact that the Term shall have expired or this Agreement or the obligations of Lenders to make Advances have been terminated; and
 (xiv) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. 
2.19. Liability for Acts and Omissions. 
(a) As among the Loan Parties and Issuer, Swing Loan Lender, Administrative Agent and Lenders, each Loan Party assumes all risks of the acts
and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Issuer shall not be responsible for: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency,
accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for an issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
inaccurate, fraudulent or forged (even if Issuer or any of its Affiliates shall have been notified thereof); (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of
Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) the failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or any other party to which
such Letter of Credit may be transferred, to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit or any other claim of any Borrower or any other Loan Party against any beneficiary of such Letter of

  57 



Credit, or any such transferee, or any dispute between or among any Borrower or any other Loan Party and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such transferee; (iv) errors,
omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, facsimile, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the
transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing
under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of Issuer, including any Governmental Acts, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of Issuers rights or
powers hereunder. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall relieve Issuer from liability for Issuers gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment) in connection
with actions or omissions described in such clauses (i) through (viii) of such sentence. In no event shall Issuer or Issuers Affiliates be liable to any Borrower or any other Loan Party for any indirect, consequential, incidental,
punitive, exemplary or special damages or expenses (including without limitation attorneys fees), or for any damages resulting from any change in the value of any property relating to a Letter of Credit. 
(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Issuer and each of its Affiliates: (i) may rely on any oral or other communication
believed in good faith by Issuer or such Affiliate to have been authorized or given by or on behalf of the applicant for a Letter of Credit; (ii) may honor any presentation if the documents presented appear on their face substantially to comply
with the terms and conditions of the relevant Letter of Credit; (iii) may honor a previously dishonored presentation under a Letter of Credit, whether such dishonor was pursuant to a court order, to settle or compromise any claim of wrongful
dishonor, or otherwise, and shall be entitled to reimbursement to the same extent as if such present

t any claim or demand made on Issuer or its Affiliate in any way related to any order issued at the applicants request to an air carrier, a letter of guarantee or of indemnity issued to a steamship agent or carrier
or any document or instrument of like import (each an Order) and honor any drawing in connection with any Letter of Credit that is the subject of such Order, notwithstanding that any drafts or other documents presented in
connection with such Letter of Credit fail to conform in any way with such Letter of Credit.  (c) In furtherance and extension and not in
limitation of the specific provisions set forth above, any action taken or omitted by Issuer under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith and
without gross negligence (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment), shall not put Issuer under any resulting liability to any Borrower, any other Loan Party, Administrative Agent or any Lender. 
  58 


2.20. Mandatory Prepayments. 
(a) Subject to Section 7.1 hereof, when any Loan Party sells or otherwise disposes of any Collateral other than Inventory in the Ordinary
Course of Business, Borrowers shall repay the Advances in an amount equal to the net proceeds of such sale (i.e., gross proceeds less the reasonable direct costs of such sales or other dispositions), such repayments to be made promptly but in no
event more than one (1) Business Day following receipt of such net proceeds, and until the date of payment, such proceeds shall be held in trust for Administrative Agent. The foregoing shall not be deemed to be implied consent to any such sale
otherwise prohibited by the terms and conditions hereof. Such repayments shall be applied to the Advances (x) first, to the outstanding principal installments of the Term Loan in the inverse order of the maturities thereof and (y) second,
to the remaining Advances in such order as Administrative Agent may determine, subject to Borrowers ability to reborrow Revolving Advances in accordance with the terms hereof. 
(b) In the event of any issuance or other incurrence of Indebtedness by any Loan Party or the issuance of any Equity Interests by any Loan
Party (other than the issuance of Equity Interests of Universal using the proceeds of the Closing Date Contribution), the Loan Parties shall, no later than one (1) Business Day after the receipt by the Loan Parties of (i) the cash proceeds
from any such issuance or incurrence of Indebtedness or (ii) the net cash proceeds of any issuance of Equity Interests, as applicable, repay the Advances in an amount equal to (x) one hundred percent (100%) of such cash proceeds in
the case of such incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness and (y) fifty percent (50%) of such net cash proceeds in the case of an issuance of Equity Interests (other than the issuance of Equity Interests of Universal using the proceeds of
the Closing Date Contribution). Such repayments will be applied in the same manner as set forth in Section 2.20(a) hereof.  (c)
Borrowers shall prepay the outstanding amount of the Advances in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) fifty percent (50%) (the Excess Cash Flow Percentage) of Excess Cash Flow and (ii) Seven Million Five Hundred
Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($7,500,000.00), for each fiscal year commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, payable upon delivery of the financial statements to Administrative Agent referred to in and required by
Section 9.7 for such fiscal year but in any event not later than ninety (90) days after the end of each such fiscal year, which amount shall be applied to the outstanding principal installments of the Term Loan in the inverse order of the
maturities thereof; provided that the Excess Cash Flow Percentage shall be reduced to twenty five (25%) (for the applicable fiscal year only) if the Leverage Ratio reflected in the applicable financial statements referred to herein for
any fiscal year-end is less than 2.5 to 1.0. In the event that the financial statements are not so delivered, then a calculation based upon estimated amounts shall be made by Administrative Agent upon which calculation Borrowers shall make the
prepayment required by this Section 2.20(c), subject to adjustment when the financial statements are delivered to Administrative Agent as required hereby. The calculation made by Administrative Agent shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights
Administrative Agent or Lenders may have as a result of the failure by Borrowers to deliver such financial statements. 
  59 


(d) On February 2, 2016, Equity Interests of Universal shall be issued by Universal in
respect of the Closing Date Contribution to the applicable members of the management team of Universal and/or certain other investors. The Borrowers hereby agree that on February 1, 2016, the Administrative Agent may apply one hundred percent
(100%) of such equity proceeds made pursuant to the Closing Date Contribution as a mandatory repayment of the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Advances. 
(e) Upon receipt by Universal of the Operating Lease Proceeds, Borrowers shall repay the outstanding amount of the Advances in an amount equal
to One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) of such cash proceeds, such repayment to be made promptly but in no event more than one (1) Business Day following receipt of such proceeds, and until the date of payment, such proceeds shall be
held in trust for Administrative Agent. Such repayment shall be applied equally to the outstanding principal installments of the Term Loan (in the inverse order of the maturities thereof) and the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving
Advances, subject to Borrowers ability to reborrow Revolving Advances in accordance with the terms hereof.  (f) All proceeds received
by Borrowers or Administrative Agent (i) under any insurance policy on account of damage or destruction of any assets or property of any Borrowers or on account of the interruption of any Borrowers business, or (ii) as a result of
any taking or condemnation of any assets or property shall be applied in accordance with Section 6.6 hereof.  2.21. Use of
Proceeds.  (a) Borrowers shall apply the proceeds of Advances to (i) repay existing indebtedness owed to PNC, (ii) pay fees
and expenses relating to this transaction, and (iii) provide for its working capital needs, including the financing of ongoing working capital requirements, capital expenditures, payments under the Gorbert Notes to the extent not prohibited by
the terms of this Agreement or the Other Documents and reimburse drawings under Letters of Credit. Borrowers shall not use the proceeds of any Revolving Advance to prepay the Term Loan. 
(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.21(a) above, neither the Borrowers, the Guarantors nor any other Person which may in the
future become party to this Agreement or the Other Documents as a Borrower or Guarantor, intends to use nor shall they use any portion of the proceeds of the Advances, directly or indirectly, for any purpose in violation of Applicable Law. 
2.22. Defaulting Lender. 
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, all rights and obligations
hereunder of such Defaulting Lender and of the other parties hereto shall be modified to the extent of the express provisions of this Section 2.22 so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender. 
(b) (i) except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Section 2.22, Revolving Advances shall be made pro rata from Lenders holding
Revolving Commitments which are not Defaulting Lenders based on their respective Revolving Commitment Percentages, and no Revolving Commitment Percentage of any Lender or any pro rata share of any Revolving Advances required to be advanced by any
Lender shall be increased as a result of any Lender 
  60 



being a Defaulting Lender. Amounts received in respect of principal of any type of Revolving Advances shall be applied to reduce such type of Revolving Advances of each Lender (other than any
Defaulting Lender) in accordance with their Revolving Commitment Percentages; provided, that, Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments received by Administrative Agent for Defaulting Lenders
benefit, nor shall a Defaulting Lender be entitled to the sharing of any payments hereunder (including any principal, interest or fees). Amounts payable to a Defaulting Lender shall instead be paid to or retained by Administrative Agent.
Administrative Agent may hold and, in its discretion, re-lend to a Borrower the amount of such payments received or retained by it for the account of such Defaulting Lender. 
(ii) fees pursuant to Section 3.3(b) hereof shall cease to accrue in favor of such Defaulting Lender. 
(iii) if any Swing Loans are outstanding or any Letters of Credit (or drawings under any Letter of Credit for which Issuer has not been
reimbursed) are outstanding or exist at the time any such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then:  (A) Defaulting Lenders
Participation Commitment in the outstanding Swing Loans and of the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit shall be reallocated among Non-Defaulting Lenders holding Revolving Commitments in proportion to the respective Revolving
Commitment Percentages of such Non-Defaulting Lenders to the extent (but only to the extent) that (x) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate sum of outstanding Revolving Advances made by any such Non-Defaulting Lender plus such
Lenders reallocated Participation Commitment in the outstanding Swing Loans plus such Lenders reallocated Participation Commitment in the aggregate Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit to exceed the Revolving
Commitment Amount of any such Non-Defaulting Lender, and (y) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time; 
(B) if the reallocation described in clause (A) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, Borrowers shall within one Business Day
following notice by Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay any outstanding Swing Loans that cannot be reallocated, and (y) second, Cash Collateralize for the benefit of Issuer, Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting
Lenders Participation Commitment in the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all Letters of Credit (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (A) above) in accordance with Section 3.2(b) for so long as such Obligations
are outstanding;  (C) if Borrowers Cash Collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lenders Participation Commitment in the Maximum
Undrawn Amount of all Letters of Credit pursuant to clause (B) above, Borrowers shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.2(a) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment
Percentage of Maximum Undrawn Amount of all Letters of Credit during the period such Defaulting Lenders Participation Commitment in the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all Letters of Credit are Cash Collateralized; 
  61 


(D) if Defaulting Lenders Participation Commitment in the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all
Letters of Credit is reallocated pursuant to clause (A) above, then the fees payable to Lenders holding Revolving Commitments pursuant to Section 3.2(a) shall be adjusted and reallocated to Non-Defaulting Lenders holding Revolving
Commitments in accordance with such reallocation; and  (E) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders Participation Commitment
in the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all Letters of Credit is neither reallocated nor Cash Collateralized pursuant to clauses (A) or (B) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of Issuer or any other Lender hereunder, all
Letter of Credit Fees payable under Section 3.2(a) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage of the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all Letters of Credit shall be payable to the Issuer (and not to such Defaulting
Lender) until (and then only to the extent that) such Participation Commitment in the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all Letters of Credit is reallocated and/or Cash Collateralized; and 
(iv) so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, Swing Loan Lender shall not be required to fund any Swing Loans and Issuer shall not be
required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless such Issuer is satisfied that the related exposure and Defaulting Lenders Participation Commitment in the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all Letters of Credit and all Swing Loans
(after giving effect to any such issuance, amendment, increase or funding) will be fully allocated to Non-Defaulting Lenders holding Revolving Commitments and/or such Letters of Credit will be Cash Collateralized in accordance with clause
(A) and (B) above, and participating interests in any newly made Swing Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.22(b)(iii)(A) above
(and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).  (c) A Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to give instructions to
Administrative Agent or to approve, disapprove, consent to or vote on any matters relating to this Agreement and the Other Documents, and all amendments, waivers and other modifications of this Agreement and the Other Documents may be made without
regard to a Defaulting Lender and, for purposes of the definition of Required Lenders and Supermajority Lenders, a Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed to be a Lender, to have any outstanding Advances or a Revolving
Commitment Percentage or Term Loan Commitment Percentage provided, that this clause (c) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification described in clauses (i) or (ii) of
Section 16.2(b).  (d) Other than as expressly set forth in this Section 2.22, the rights and obligations of a Defaulting Lender
(including the obligation to indemnify Administrative Agent) and the other parties hereto shall remain unchanged. Nothing in this Section 2.22 shall be deemed to release any Defaulting Lender from its obligations under this Agreement and the
Other Documents, shall alter such obligations, shall operate as a waiver of any default by such Defaulting Lender hereunder, or shall prejudice any rights which any Loan Party, Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against any Defaulting
Lender as a result of any default by such Defaulting Lender hereunder. 
  62 


(e) In the event that Administrative Agent, the Loan Parties, Swing Loan Lender and Issuer agree
in writing that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, and, if such cured Defaulting Lender is a Lender, then
Participation Commitments of Lenders (including such cured Defaulting Lender) of the Swing Loans and Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit shall be reallocated to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Revolving
Commitment, and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Advances of the other Lenders as Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Revolving Advances in accordance with
its Revolving Commitment Percentage.  (f) If Swing Loan Lender or Issuer has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in
fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, Swing Loan Lender shall not be required to fund any Swing Loans and Issuer shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of
Credit, unless Swing Loan Lender or Issuer, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with Borrowers or such Lender, satisfactory to Swing Loan Lender or Issuer, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender
hereunder.  2.23. Payment of Obligations. 
Administrative Agent may charge to Borrowers Account as a Revolving Advance or, at the discretion of Swing Loan Lender, as a Swing Loan
(i) all payments with respect to any of the Obligations required hereunder (including without limitation principal payments, payments of interest, payments of Letter of Credit Fees and all other fees provided for hereunder and payments under
Sections 16.5 and 16.9) as and when each such payment shall become due and payable (whether as regularly scheduled, upon or after acceleration, upon maturity or otherwise), (ii) without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (i),
(a) all amounts expended by Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to Sections 4.2 or 4.3 hereof and (b) all expenses which Administrative Agent incurs in connection with the forwarding of Advance proceeds and the establishment and
maintenance of any Blocked Accounts or Depository Accounts as provided for in Section 4.8(h), and (iii) any sums expended by Administrative Agent or any Lender due to any Loan Partys failure to perform or comply with its obligations
under this Agreement or any Other Document including any Loan Partys obligations under Sections 3.3, 4.4, 4.7, 6.4, 6.6, 6.7 and 6.8 hereof, and all amounts so charged shall be added to the Obligations and shall be secured by the Collateral.
To the extent Revolving Advances are not actually funded by the other Lenders in respect of any such amounts so charged, all such amounts so charged shall be deemed to be Revolving Advances made by and owing to Administrative Agent and
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to all rights (including accrual of interest) and remedies of a Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents with respect to such Revolving Advances. 
2.24. Increase in Maximum Revolving Advance Amount. 
(a) Borrowers may, at any time prior to the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, request that the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount be increased by (1) one or more of the current Lenders increasing their Revolving Commitment Amount (any current 
  63 



Lender which elects to increase its Revolving Commitment Amount shall be referred to as an Increasing Lender) and/or (2) one or more new lenders (each a New
Lender) joining this Agreement and providing a Revolving Commitment Amount hereunder , subject to the following terms and conditions: 
(i) No current Lender shall be obligated to increase its Revolving Commitment Amount and any increase in the Revolving Commitment Amount by
any current Lender shall be in the sole discretion of such current Lender;  (ii) Borrowers may not request the addition of a New Lender
unless (and then only to the extent that) there is insufficient participation on behalf of the existing Lenders in the increased Revolving Commitments being requested by Borrowers; 
(iii) There shall exist no Event of Default or Default on the effective date of such increase after giving effect to such increase; 
(iv) After giving effect to such increase, the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount shall not exceed Ninety Million and 00/100 Dollars
($90,000,000.00);  (v) Borrowers may not request an increase in the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount under this Section 2.24 more
than two (2) times during the Term, and no single such increase in the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount shall be for an amount less than Ten Million and 00/100 Dollars ($10,000,000.00); 
(vi) The Loan Parties shall deliver to Administrative Agent on or before the effective date of such increase the following documents in form
and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent: (1) certifications of their corporate secretaries with attached resolutions certifying that the increase in the Revolving Commitment Amounts has been approved by such Loan Parties,
(2) certificate dated as of the effective date of such increase certifying that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and certifying that the representations and warranties made by each Loan Party herein and in
the Other Documents are true and complete in all respects with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date (except to the extent any such representation or warranty expressly relates only to any earlier and/or specified date),
(3) such other agreements, instruments and information (including supplements or modifications to this Agreement and/or the Other Documents executed by Loan Parties as Administrative Agent reasonably deems necessary in order to document the
increase to the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount and to protect, preserve and continue the perfection and priority of the liens, security interests, rights and remedies of Administrative Agent and Lenders hereunder and under the Other Documents in
light of such increase), and (4) an opinion of counsel in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent which shall cover such matters related to such increase as Administrative Agent may reasonably require and each Loan Party hereby
authorizes and directs such counsel to deliver such opinions to Administrative Agent and Lenders;  (vii) Borrowers shall execute and
deliver (1) to each Increasing Lender a replacement Note reflecting the new amount of such Increasing Lenders Revolving Commitment Amount after giving effect to the increase (and the prior Note issued to such Increasing Lender shall be
deemed to be cancelled) and (2) to each New Lender a Note reflecting the amount of such New Lenders Revolving Commitment Amount; 
  64 


(viii) Any New Lender shall be subject to the approval of Administrative Agent and Issuer; 
(ix) Each Increasing Lender shall confirm its agreement to increase its Revolving Commitment Amount pursuant to an acknowledgement in a form
acceptable to Administrative Agent, signed by it and each Loan Party and delivered to Administrative Agent at least five (5) days before the effective date of such increase; and 
(x) Each New Lender shall execute a lender joinder in substantially the form of Exhibit 2.24 pursuant to which such New Lender shall
join and become a party to this Agreement and the Other Documents with a Revolving Commitment Amount as set forth in such lender joinder. 
(b) On the effective date of such increase, (i) Borrowers shall repay all Revolving Advances then outstanding, subject to Borrowers
obligations under Sections 3.7, 3.9, or 3.10; provided that subject to the other conditions of this Agreement, the Borrowing Agent may request new Revolving Advances on such date and (ii) the Revolving Commitment Percentages of Lenders
(including each Increasing Lender and/or New Lender) shall be recalculated such that each such Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage is equal to (x) the Revolving Commitment Amount of such Lender divided by (y) the aggregate
of the Revolving Commitment Amounts of all Lenders. Each Lender shall participate in any new Revolving Advances made on or after such date in accordance with its Revolving Commitment Percentage after giving effect to the increase in the Maximum
Revolving Advance Amount and recalculation of the Revolving Commitment Percentages contemplated by this Section 2.24.  (c) On the
effective date of such increase, each Increasing Lender shall be deemed to have purchased an additional/increased participation in, and each New Lender will be deemed to have purchased a new participation in, each then outstanding Letter of Credit
and each drawing thereunder and each then outstanding Swing Loan in an amount equal to such Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage (as calculated pursuant to Section 2.24(b) above) of the Maximum Undrawn Amount of each such Letter of
Credit (as in effect from time to time) and the amount of each drawing and of each such Swing Loan, respectively. As necessary to effectuate the foregoing, each existing Lender that is not an Increasing Lender shall be deemed to have sold to each
applicable Increasing Lender and/or New Lender, as necessary, a portion of such existing Lenders participations in such outstanding Letters of Credit and drawings and such outstanding Swing Loans such that, after giving effect to all such
purchases and sales, each Lender (including each Increasing Lender and/or New Lender) shall hold a participation in all Letters of Credit (and drawings thereunder) and all Swing Loans in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitment
Percentages (as calculated pursuant to Section 2.24(b) above). 
  65 


(d) On the effective date of such increase, Borrowers shall pay all cost and expenses incurred by
Administrative Agent and by each Increasing Lender and New Lender in connection with the negotiations regarding, and the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of all agreements and instruments executed and delivered by any of
Administrative Agent, Borrowers and/or Increasing Lenders and New Lenders in connection with, such increase (including all fees for any supplemental or additional public filings of any Other Documents necessary to protect, preserve and continue the
perfection and priority of the liens, security interests, rights and remedies of Administrative Agent and Lenders hereunder and under the Other Documents in light of such increase). 
III. INTEREST AND FEES.  3.1. Interest.
 Interest on Advances shall be payable in arrears on the first day of each month with respect to Domestic Rate Loans and, with respect to
LIBOR Rate Loans, at the end of each Interest Period, provided further that all accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable at the end of the Term. Interest charges shall be computed on the actual principal amount of Advances outstanding
during the month at a rate per annum equal to (i) with respect to Revolving Advances, the Revolving Interest Rate and (ii) with respect to Swing Loans, the Revolving Interest Rate for Domestic Rate Loan and (iii) with respect to the
Term Loan, the Term Loan Rate (as applicable, the Contract Rate). Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, any Obligations other than the Advances that are not paid when due shall accrue interest at the Revolving
Interest Rate for Domestic Rate Loans, subject to the provision of the final sentence of this Section 3.1 regarding the Default Rate. Whenever, subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the Alternate Base Rate is increased or decreased, the
applicable Contract Rate shall be similarly changed without notice or demand of any kind by an amount equal to the amount of such change in the Alternate Base Rate during the time such change or changes remain in effect. The LIBOR Rate shall be
adjusted with respect to LIBOR Rate Loans without notice or demand of any kind on the effective date of any change in the Reserve Percentage as of such effective date. Upon and after the occurrence of an Event of Default, and during the continuation
thereof, at the option of Administrative Agent or at the direction of Required Lenders (or, in the case of any Event of Default under Section 10.7, immediately and automatically upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default without the
requirement of any affirmative action by any party), the Obligations shall bear interest at the applicable Contract Rate for Domestic Rate Loans plus two percent (2%) per annum (the Default Rate). 
3.2. Letter of Credit Fees. 
(a) Borrowers shall pay (x) to Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of Lenders, fees for each Letter of Credit for the period
from and excluding the date of issuance of same to and including the date of expiration or termination, equal to the average daily face amount of each outstanding Letter of Credit multiplied by the Applicable Margin for Revolving Advances consisting
of LIBOR Rate Loans, such fees to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed and to be payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter and on the last day of the Term, and (y) to
Issuer, a fronting fee of one quarter of one percent (0.25%) per annum times the average daily face amount of each outstanding Letter of Credit for the period from and excluding the date of issuance of same to and including the date of expiration or
termination, to be payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter and on the last day of the Term. (all of the foregoing fees, the 
  66 



Letter of Credit Fees). In addition, Borrowers shall pay to Administrative Agent, for the benefit of Issuer, any and all administrative, issuance, amendment, payment and
negotiation charges with respect to Letters of Credit and all fees and expenses as agreed upon by Issuer and the Borrowing Agent in connection with any Letter of Credit, including in connection with the opening, amendment or renewal of any such
Letter of Credit and any acceptances created thereunder, all such charges, fees and expenses, if any, to be payable on demand. All such charges shall be deemed earned in full on the date when the same are due and payable hereunder and shall not be
subject to rebate or pro-ration upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason. Any such charge in effect at the time of a particular transaction shall be the charge for that transaction, notwithstanding any subsequent change in Issuers
prevailing charges for that type of transaction. Upon and after the occurrence of an Event of Default, and during the continuation thereof, at the option of Administrative Agent or at the direction of Required Lenders (or, in the case of any Event
of Default under Section 10.7, immediately and automatically upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default without the requirement of any affirmative action by any party), the Letter of Credit Fees described in clause (x) of this
Section 3.2(a) shall be increased by an additional two percent (2.0%) per annum.  (b) At any time following the occurrence of an
Event of Default, at the option of Administrative Agent or at the direction of Required Lenders (or, in the case of any Event of Default under Section 10.7, immediately and automatically upon the occurrence of such Event of Default, without the
requirement of any affirmative action by any party), or upon the expiration of the Term or any other termination of this Agreement (and also, if applicable, in connection with any mandatory prepayment under Section 2.20), Borrowers shall Cash
Collateralize all Letters of Credit, and each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes Administrative Agent, in its discretion, on such Borrowers behalf and in such Borrowers name, to open such an account and to make and maintain deposits
therein, or in an account opened by such Borrower, in the amounts required to be made by such Borrower, out of the proceeds of Receivables or other Collateral or out of any other funds of such Borrower coming into any Lenders possession at any
time. Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, invest such cash collateral (less applicable reserves) in such short-term money-market items as to which Administrative Agent and such Borrower mutually agree (or, in the absence of such agreement,
as Administrative Agent may reasonably select) and the net return on such investments shall be credited to such account and constitute additional cash collateral, or Administrative Agent may (notwithstanding the foregoing) establish the account
provided for under this Section 3.2(b) as a non-interest bearing account and in such case Administrative Agent shall have no obligation (and Borrowers hereby waive any claim) under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or under any other
Applicable Law to pay interest on such cash collateral being held by Administrative Agent. No Borrower may withdraw amounts credited to any such account except upon the occurrence of (1) the cure or waiver of all Events of Default which
resulted in the requirement to Cash Collateralize, or (2) all of the following: (x) payment and performance in full of all Obligations; (y) expiration of all Letters of Credit; and (z) termination of this Agreement. Borrowers
hereby assign, pledge and grant to Administrative Agent, for its benefit and the ratable benefit of Issuer, Lenders and each other Secured Party, a continuing security interest in and to and Lien on any such cash collateral and any right, title and
interest of Borrowers in any deposit account, securities account or investment account into which such cash collateral may be deposited from time to time to secure the Obligations, specifically including all Obligations with respect to any Letters
of Credit. Borrowers agree that upon the coming due of any Reimbursement Obligations (or any other Obligations, including Obligations for Letter of Credit Fees) with respect to the Letters of Credit, Administrative Agent may use such cash collateral
to pay and satisfy such Obligations. 
  67 


3.3. Administrative Agents Fee Letter, Facility Fee and Collateral Monitoring Fees.
 (a) Borrowers shall pay the amounts required to be paid in the Administrative Agents Fee Letter in the manner and at the times
required by the Administrative Agents Fee Letter.  (b) If, for any calendar quarter during the Term, the average daily unpaid balance
of the sum of Revolving Advances plus Swing Loans plus the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit for each day of such calendar quarter does not equal the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount, then Borrowers shall pay to
Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of Lenders based on their Revolving Commitment Percentages, a fee at a rate equal to one-quarter of one percent (.25%) per annum on the amount by which the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount exceeds such
average daily unpaid balance (the Facility Fee). Such Facility Fee shall be payable to Administrative Agent in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter with respect to the previous calendar quarter. 
(c) On the first day of the month following any month in which the Administrative Agent performs any collateral monitoring, namely any field
examination (subject to any limitations in this Agreement), collateral analysis or other business analysis, the need for which is to be determined by the Administrative Agent and which monitoring is undertaken by the Administrative Agent or for the
Administrative Agents benefit, Borrowers agree to pay a field examination fee of One Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000.00) per day for each person employed to perform such monitoring, plus all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and disbursements
incurred by the Administrative Agent in the performance of such examination or analysis.  3.4. [Reserved]. 
3.5. Computation of Interest and Fees. 
Interest and fees hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and for the actual number of days elapsed; provided that the
interest applicable to Domestic Rate Loans shall be computed upon the basis of a year of 365/366 days and for the actual number of days elapsed. If any payment to be made hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the due
date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest thereon shall be payable at the applicable Contract Rate during such extension. 
3.6. Maximum Charges.  In
no event whatsoever shall interest and other charges charged hereunder exceed the highest rate permissible under Applicable Law. In the event interest and other charges as computed hereunder would otherwise exceed the highest rate permitted under
Applicable Law: (i) the interest rates hereunder will be reduced to the maximum rate permitted under Applicable Law; (ii) such excess amount shall be first applied to any unpaid principal balance owed by Borrowers; and (iii) if the
then remaining excess amount is greater than the previously unpaid principal balance, Lenders shall promptly refund such excess amount to Borrowers and the provisions hereof shall be deemed amended to provide for such permissible rate. 
  68 


3.7. Increased Costs. 
In the event that any Applicable Law or any Change in Law or compliance by any Lender (for purposes of this Section 3.7, the term
Lender shall include Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender, any Issuer or Lender and any corporation or bank controlling Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender, any Lender or Issuer and the office or branch where Administrative Agent,
Swing Loan Lender, any Lender or Issuer (as so defined) makes or maintains any LIBOR Rate Loans) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other financial, monetary or other authority, shall:
 (a) subject Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender, any Lender or Issuer to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this
Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any LIBOR Rate Loan, or change the basis of taxation of payments to Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender, such Lender or Issuer in respect thereof (except for Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.10 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender, such Lender or the Issuer); 
(b) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, assessment, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
requirement against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, any office of Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender, Issuer or any Lender, including pursuant to Regulation D of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; or  (c) impose on Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender, any Lender or Issuer or the London
interbank LIBOR market any other condition, loss or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or any Other Document or any Advance made by any Lender, or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender, any Lender or Issuer of making,
converting to, continuing, renewing or maintaining its Advances hereunder by an amount that Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender, such Lender or Issuer deems to be material or to reduce the amount of any payment (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise) in respect of any of the Advances by an amount that Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender or such Lender or Issuer deems to be material, then, in any case Borrowers shall promptly pay Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender, such Lender
or Issuer, upon its demand, such additional amount as will compensate Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender or such Lender or Issuer for such additional cost or such reduction, as the case may be, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to
increased costs which are reflected in the LIBOR Rate, as the case may be. Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender, such Lender or Issuer shall certify the amount of such additional cost or reduced amount to Borrowing Agent, and such certification
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  69 


3.8. Basis For Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair. 
In the event that Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have determined that: 
(a) reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for any Interest Period; 
(b) Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for the relevant maturity are not available in the London interbank LIBOR market, with respect
to an outstanding LIBOR Rate Loan, a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan, or a proposed conversion of a Domestic Rate Loan into a LIBOR Rate Loan; 
(c) the making, maintenance or funding of any LIBOR Rate Loan has been made impracticable or unlawful by compliance by Administrative Agent or
such Lender in good faith with any Applicable Law or any interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental Body or with any request or directive of any such Governmental Body (whether or not having the force of law); or 
(d) the LIBOR Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender of the establishment or maintenance of any LIBOR Rate Loan,
 then Administrative Agent shall give Borrowing Agent prompt written or telephonic notice of such determination. If such notice is given,
(i) any such requested LIBOR Rate Loan shall be made as a Domestic Rate Loan, unless Borrowing Agent shall notify Administrative Agent no later than 1:00 p.m. two (2) Business Days prior to the date of such proposed borrowing, that its
request for such borrowing shall be cancelled or made as an unaffected type of LIBOR Rate Loan, (ii) any Domestic Rate Loan or LIBOR Rate Loan which was to have been converted to an affected type of LIBOR Rate Loan shall be continued as or
converted into a Domestic Rate Loan, or, if Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent, no later than 1:00 p.m. two (2) Business Days prior to the proposed conversion, shall be maintained as an unaffected type of LIBOR Rate Loan, and (iii) any
outstanding affected LIBOR Rate Loans shall be converted into a Domestic Rate Loan, or, if Borrowing Agent shall notify Administrative Agent, no later than 1:00 p.m. two (2) Business Days prior to the last Business Day of the then current
Interest Period applicable to such affected LIBOR Rate Loan, shall be converted into an unaffected type of LIBOR Rate Loan, on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period for such affected LIBOR Rate Loans (or sooner, if any Lender
cannot continue to lawfully maintain such affected LIBOR Rate Loan). Until such notice has been withdrawn, Lenders shall have no obligation to make an affected type of LIBOR Rate Loan or maintain outstanding affected LIBOR Rate Loans and no Borrower
shall have the right to convert a Domestic Rate Loan or an unaffected type of LIBOR Rate Loan into an affected type of LIBOR Rate Loan. 
3.9. Capital Adequacy. 
(a) In the event that Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender or any Lender shall have determined that any Applicable Law or guideline
regarding capital adequacy, or any Change in Law or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Body, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by
Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender, Issuer or 
  70 



any Lender (for purposes of this Section 3.9, the term Lender shall include Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender, Issuer or any Lender and any corporation or bank controlling
Administrative Agent , Swing Loan Lender or any Lender and the office or branch where Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender or any Lender (as so defined) makes or maintains any LIBOR Rate Loans) with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender or any Lenders capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder (including the making of any Swing Loans) to a level below that which Administrative Agent , Swing Loan Lender or such Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
consideration Administrative Agents, Swing Loan Lenders and each Lenders policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender or any Lender to be material, then, from time to
time, Borrowers shall pay upon demand to Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender or such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Administrative Agent , Swing Loan Lender or such Lender for such reduction. In determining such
amount or amounts, Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging or attribution methods. The protection of this Section 3.9 shall be available to Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender and each Lender
regardless of any possible contention of invalidity or inapplicability with respect to the Applicable Law, rule, regulation, guideline or condition. 
(b) A certificate of Administrative Agent, Swing Loan Lender or such Lender setting forth such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to
compensate Administrative Agent , Swing Loan Lender or such Lender with respect to Section 3.9(a) hereof when delivered to Borrowing Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
3.10. Taxes.  (a) Any and
all payments by or on account of any Obligations hereunder or under any Other Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if Loan Parties shall be
required by Applicable Law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) Agents, Swing Loan Lender, Lender, Issuer or Participant, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) Loan Parties shall make
such deductions and (iii) Loan Parties shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Body in accordance with Applicable Law. 
(b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 3.10(a) above, Borrowers shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Body
in accordance with Applicable Law.  (c) Each Loan Party shall indemnify each Agent, Swing Loan Lender, each Lender, Issuer and any
Participant, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid
by such 
  71 



Agent, Swing Loan Lender, such Lender, Issuer, or such Participant, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or
not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Body. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Loan Parties by any Lender, Swing Loan Lender,
Participant, or Issuer (with a copy to Administrative Agent), or by any Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of Swing Loan Lender, a Lender or Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Body, Loan Parties shall
deliver to Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Body evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to
Administrative Agent.  (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the
jurisdiction in which any Loan Party is resident for tax purposes, or under any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any Other Document shall deliver to Loan Parties (with a copy to Administrative
Agent), at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by Loan Parties or Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by Applicable Law as will permit such payments to be made
without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. Notwithstanding the submission of such documentation claiming a reduced rate of or exemption from U.S. withholding tax, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to withhold United States federal
income taxes at the full 30% withholding rate if in its reasonable judgment it is required to do so under the due diligence requirements imposed upon a withholding agent under § 1.1441-7(b) of the United States Income Tax Regulations or other
Applicable Law. Further, Administrative Agent is indemnified under § 1.1461-1(e) of the United States Income Tax Regulations against any claims and demands of any Lender, Issuer or assignee or participant of a Lender or Issuer for the amount of
any tax it deducts and withholds in accordance with regulations under § 1441 of the Code. In addition, any Lender, if requested by Loan Parties or Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or
reasonably requested by the Loan Parties or Administrative Agent as will enable Loan Parties or Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, in the event that any Loan Party is resident for tax purposes in the United States of America, any Foreign Lender (or other Lender) shall deliver to Loan Parties and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as
shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender (or other Lender) becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of Loan Parties or Administrative Agent, but only if
such Foreign Lender (or other Lender) is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable: two (2) duly completed valid originals of IRS Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the
United States of America is a party, 
  72 


(i) two (2) duly completed valid originals of IRS Form W-8ECI, 
(ii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code,
(x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of a Loan Party within the meaning of section
881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) two duly completed valid originals of IRS Form W-8BEN, 
(iii) any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding
tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Loan Parties to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made, or 
(iv) To the extent that any Lender is not a Foreign Lender, such Lender shall submit to Administrative Agent two (2) originals of an IRS
Form W-9 or any other form prescribed by Applicable Law demonstrating that such Lender is not a Foreign Lender.  (f) If a payment made to a
Lender, Swing Loan Lender, Participant, Issuer, or an Agent under this Agreement or any Other Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Person fails to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of
FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender, Swing Loan Lender, Participant, Issuer, or such Agent shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (in the case of Swing Loan Lender, a
Lender, Participant or Issuer) and Loan Parties (A) a certification signed by the chief financial officer, principal accounting officer, treasurer or controller of such Person, and (B) other documentation reasonably requested by
Administrative Agent or any Loan Party sufficient for Administrative Agent and Loan Parties to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that Swing Loan Lender, such Lender, Participant, Issuer, or such Agent has complied with such
applicable reporting requirements.  (g) If an Agent, Swing Loan Lender, a Lender, a Participant or Issuer determines, in its sole
discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by Loan Parties or with respect to which Loan Parties have paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to Loan
Parties an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by Loan Parties under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund); net of all
out-of-pocket expenses of such Agent, Swing Loan Lender, such Lender, Participant, or the Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Body with respect to such refund), provided that
Loan Parties, upon the request of such Agent, Swing Loan Lender, such Lender, Participant, or Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to Loan Parties (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Body) to
such Agent, Swing Loan Lender, such Lender, Participant or the Issuer in the event such Agent, Swing Loan Lender, such Lender, Participant or the Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Body. This Section shall not be construed
to require any Agent, Swing Loan Lender, any Lender, Participant, or Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to Loan Parties or any other Person.

3.11. Replacement of Lenders. 
If any Lender (an Affected Lender) (a) makes demand upon Borrowers for (or if Borrowers are otherwise required to pay)
amounts pursuant to Section 3.7 or 3.9 hereof, (b) is unable to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans as a result of a condition described in Section 2.2(h) hereof, (c) is a Defaulting Lender, or (d) denies any consent requested
by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 16.2(b) hereof, Borrowers may, within ninety (90) days of receipt of such demand, notice (or the occurrence of such other event causing Borrowers to be required to pay such compensation or
causing Section 2.2(h) hereof to be applicable), or such Lender becoming a Defaulting Lender or denial of a request by Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 16.2(b) hereof, as the case may be, by notice in writing to the Administrative
Agent and such Affected Lender (i) request the Affected Lender to cooperate with Borrowers in obtaining a replacement Lender satisfactory to Administrative Agent and Borrowers (the Replacement Lender); (ii) request the
non-Affected Lenders to acquire and assume all of the Affected Lenders Advances and its Revolving Commitment Percentage and/or Term Loan Commitment Percentages, as applicable, as provided herein, but none of such Lenders shall be under any
obligation to do so; or (iii) propose a Replacement Lender subject to approval by Administrative Agent in its good faith business judgment. If any satisfactory Replacement Lender shall be obtained, and/or if any one or more of the non-Affected
Lenders shall agree to acquire and assume all of the Affected Lenders Advances and its Revolving Commitment Percentage and/or Term Loan Commitment Percentages, as applicable, then such Affected Lender shall assign, in accordance with
Section 16.3 hereof, all of its Advances and its Revolving Commitment Percentage and/or Term Loan Commitment Percentages, as applicable, and other rights and obligations under this Loan Agreement and the Other Documents to such Replacement
Lender or non-Affected Lenders, as the case may be, in exchange for payment of the principal amount so assigned and all interest and fees accrued on the amount so assigned, plus all other Obligations then due and payable to the Affected
Lender.  IV. COLLATERAL: GENERAL TERMS  4.1.
Security Interest in the Collateral.  To secure the prompt payment and performance to each Agent, Issuer and each Lender (and each
other holder of any Obligations) of the Obligations, each Loan Party hereby assigns, pledges and grants to Administrative Agent for its benefit and for the ratable benefit of each Lender, Issuer and each other Secured Party, a continuing security
interest in and to and Lien on all of its Collateral, whether now owned or existing or hereafter created, acquired or arising and wheresoever located. Each Loan Party shall mark its books and records as may be necessary or appropriate to evidence,
protect and perfect Administrative Agents security interest and shall cause its financial statements to reflect such security interest. Each Loan Party shall provide Administrative Agent with written notice of all commercial tort claims for
which the amount of damages sought exceeds Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($500,000.00) promptly upon the occurrence of any events giving rise to any such claim(s) (regardless of whether legal proceedings have yet been commenced), such
notice to contain a brief description of the claim(s), the events out of which such claim(s) arose and the parties against which such claims may be asserted and, if applicable in any case where legal proceedings regarding such claim(s) have been
commenced, the case title together with the applicable court and docket number. 
  74 



Upon delivery of each such notice, such Loan Party shall be deemed to thereby grant to Administrative Agent a security interest and lien in and to such commercial tort claims described therein
and all proceeds thereof. Each Loan Party shall provide Administrative Agent with written notice promptly upon becoming the beneficiary under any letter of credit or otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in any letter of credit rights,
and at Administrative Agents request shall take such actions as Administrative Agent may reasonably request for the perfection of Administrative Agents security interest therein. 
4.2. Perfection of Security Interest. 
Each Loan Party shall take all action that may be necessary or desirable, or that Administrative Agent may request, so as at all times to
maintain the validity, perfection, enforceability and priority of Administrative Agents security interest in and Lien on the Collateral or to enable Administrative Agent to protect, exercise or enforce its rights hereunder and in the
Collateral, including, but not limited to, (i) immediately discharging all Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances, (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Lien Waiver Agreements as Administrative Agent may reasonably request
(it being understood that, in each case, notwithstanding the use of or failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such Lien Waiver Agreements, the failure to so obtain any such Lien Waiver Agreement shall entitle the Administrative
Agent to institute an appropriate rent reserve as determined in the Administrative Agents Permitted Discretion with respect to any such location (provided that the Loan Parties shall not be required to obtain Lien Waiver Agreements with
respect to those locations of the Loan Parties identified on Schedule 4.4 or in the separate writing referenced in Section 4.4 hereof at which less than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($250,000.00) of Collateral is
located; provided further that such requirement shall only be waived with respect to Collateral with an aggregate value of One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00 for all locations)), (iii) delivering to Administrative Agent, endorsed or
accompanied by such instruments of assignment as Administrative Agent may specify, and stamping or marking, in such manner as Administrative Agent may specify, any and all chattel paper, instruments, letters of credits and advices thereof and
documents evidencing or forming a part of the Collateral, (iv) entering into warehousing, lockbox, customs and freight agreements and other custodial arrangements satisfactory to Administrative Agent, and (v) executing and delivering
financing statements, control agreements, instruments of pledge, mortgages, notices and assignments, in each case in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent, relating to the creation, validity, perfection, maintenance or continuation
of Administrative Agents security interest and Lien under the Uniform Commercial Code or other Applicable Law. By its signature hereto, each Loan Party hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to file against such Loan Party, one or more
financing, continuation or amendment statements pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent (which statements may have a description of collateral which is broader than that set forth herein,
including without limitation a description of Collateral as all assets and/or all personal property of any Loan Party). All charges, expenses and fees Administrative Agent may incur in doing any of the foregoing, and any
local taxes relating thereto, shall be charged to Borrowers Account as a Revolving Advance of a Domestic Rate Loan and added to the Obligations, or, at Administrative Agents option, shall be paid by Loan Parties to Administrative Agent
for its benefit and for the ratable benefit of Agents and Lenders immediately upon demand. 
  75 


4.3. Preservation of Collateral. 
Following the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default, in addition to the rights and remedies set forth in Section 11.1 hereof,
Administrative Agent: (a) may at any time take such steps as Administrative Agent deems necessary to protect Administrative Agents interest in and to preserve the Collateral, including the hiring of security guards or the placing of other
security protection measures as Administrative Agent may deem appropriate; (b) may employ and maintain at any of any Loan Partys premises a custodian who shall have full authority to do all acts necessary to protect Administrative

or equipment for handling or removing the Collateral; and (e) shall have, and is hereby granted, a right of ingress and egress to the places where the Collateral is located, and may proceed over and through any of Loan Parties owned or
leased property. Each Loan Party shall cooperate fully with all of Administrative Agents efforts to preserve the Collateral and will take such actions to preserve the Collateral as Administrative Agent may direct. All of Administrative
Agents expenses of preserving the Collateral, including any expenses relating to the bonding of a custodian, shall be charged to Borrowers Account as a Revolving Advance maintained as a Domestic Rate Loan and added to the Obligations.
 4.4. Ownership and Location of Collateral. 
(a) With respect to the Collateral, at the time the Collateral becomes subject to Administrative Agents security interest: (i) each
Loan Party shall be the sole owner of and fully authorized and able to sell, transfer, pledge and/or grant a first priority security interest in each and every item of its respective Collateral to Administrative Agent; and, except for Permitted
Encumbrances the Collateral shall be free and clear of all Liens whatsoever; (ii) each document and agreement executed by each Loan Party or delivered to Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with this Agreement shall be true and
correct in all respects; (iii) all signatures and endorsements of each Loan Party that appear on such documents and agreements shall be genuine and each Loan Party shall have full capacity to execute same; and (iv) each Loan Partys

warehouse at which Inventory of any Loan Party is stored; none of the receipts received by any Loan Party from any warehouse states 
  76 



that the goods covered thereby are to be delivered to bearer or to the order of a named Person or to a named Person and such named Persons assigns; (iii) Schedule 4.4 hereto
sets forth a correct and complete list as of the Closing Date of (A) each place of business of each Loan Party and (B) the chief executive office of each Loan Party; and (iv) Schedule 4.4 hereto sets forth a correct and
complete list as of the Closing Date of the location, by state and street address, of all Real Property owned or leased by each Loan Party, identifying which properties are owned and which are leased, together with the names and addresses of any
landlords.  4.5. Defense of Administrative Agents and Lenders Interests. 
Until (a) payment and performance in full of all of the Obligations and (b) termination of this Agreement, Administrative
Agents interests in the Collateral shall continue in full force and effect. During such period no Loan Party shall, without Administrative Agents prior written consent, pledge, sell (except for sales or other dispositions otherwise
permitted in Section 7.1(b) hereof), assign, transfer, create or suffer to exist a Lien upon or encumber or allow or suffer to be encumbered in any way except for Permitted Encumbrances, any part of the Collateral. Each Loan Party shall defend
Administrative Agents interests in the Collateral against any and all Persons whatsoever. At any time following demand by Administrative Agent for payment of all Obligations, Administrative Agent shall have the right to take possession of the
indicia of the Collateral and the Collateral in whatever physical form contained, including: labels, stationery, documents, instruments and advertising materials. If Administrative Agent exercises this right to take possession of the Collateral,
Loan Parties shall, upon demand, assemble it in the best manner possible and make it available to Administrative Agent at a place reasonably convenient to Administrative Agent. In addition, with respect to all Collateral, Administrative Agent and
Lenders shall be entitled to all of the rights and remedies set forth herein and further provided by the Uniform Commercial Code or other Applicable Law. Each Loan Party shall, and Administrative Agent may, at its option, instruct all suppliers,
carriers, forwarders, warehousers or others receiving or holding cash, checks, Inventory, documents or instruments in which Administrative Agent holds a security interest to deliver same to Administrative Agent and/or subject to Administrative
Agents order and if they shall come into any Loan Partys possession, they, and each of them, shall be held by such Loan Party in trust as Administrative Agents trustee, and such Loan Party will immediately deliver them to
Administrative Agent in their original form together with any necessary endorsement.  4.6. Inspection of Premises. 
At all reasonable times and from time to time as often as Co-Collateral Agents shall elect in their sole discretion, each Co-Collateral Agent
and each Lender shall have full access to and the right to audit, check, inspect and make abstracts and copies from each Loan Partys books, records, audits, correspondence and all other papers relating to the Collateral and the operation of
each Loan Partys business; provided that no more than two (2) field examinations per fiscal year shall be at the Loan Partys expense; provided, further, that (A) there shall be no limitation on the number or frequency of such
field examinations at the Loan Parties expense if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and (B) any such field examination initiated during any applicable FE/Appraisal Trigger Period shall be at the Loan Partys
expense. Any Agent, any Lender and their agents may enter upon any premises of any Loan Party at any time during business hours and at any other reasonable time, and from time to time as often as any Agent shall elect in its sole discretion, for the
purpose of inspecting the Collateral and any and all records pertaining thereto and the operation of such Loan Partys business. 
  77 


4.7. Appraisals. 
Co-Collateral Agents may, in their sole discretion, exercised in a commercially reasonable manner, at any time after the Closing Date and from
time to time, engage the services of an independent appraisal firm or firms of reputable standing, satisfactory to Co-Collateral Agents, for the purpose of appraising the then current values of Loan Parties assets; provided that (i) no
more than two (2) Inventory appraisals per fiscal year, two (2) equipment appraisals (including one desktop appraisal) per fiscal year (which equipment appraisals may be waived in writing by the Co-Collateral Agents in their Permitted
Discretion) and one (1) Real Property appraisal per fiscal year (which Real Property appraisal may be waived in writing by the Co-Collateral Agents in their Permitted Discretion) shall be at the Loan Partys expense, (ii) each
inventory appraisal shall include physical inspections of the Loan Parties locations accounting for 50% or more of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of inventory and (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) there shall be
no limitation on the number or frequency of such appraisals at the Loan Parties expense if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (B) any such appraisal on the Inventory of the Loan Parties initiated during any applicable
FE/Appraisal Trigger Period shall be at the Loan Partys expense. Absent the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default at such time, Co-Collateral Agents shall consult with Loan Parties as to the identity of any such firm. In the event
the value of Borrowers Inventory and/or equipment, as so determined pursuant to such appraisal, is less than anticipated by Co-Collateral Agents or Lenders, such that the Revolving Advances are in excess of such Advances permitted hereunder,
then, promptly upon any Agents demand for same, Borrowers shall make mandatory prepayments of the then outstanding Revolving Advances so as to eliminate the excess Advances. 
4.8. Receivables; Deposit Accounts and Securities Accounts. 
(a) Each of the Receivables shall be a bona fide and valid account representing a bona fide indebtedness incurred by the Customer therein
named, for a fixed sum as set forth in the invoice relating thereto (provided immaterial or unintentional invoice errors shall not be deemed to be a breach hereof) with respect to an absolute sale or lease and delivery of goods upon stated terms of
a Loan Party, or work, labor or services theretofore rendered by a Loan Party as of the date each Receivable is created. Same shall be due and owing in accordance with the applicable Loan Partys standard terms of sale without dispute, setoff
or counterclaim except as may be stated on the accounts receivable schedules delivered by Loan Parties to Co-Collateral Agents.  (b) Each
Customer, to the best of each Loan Partys knowledge, as of the date each Receivable is created, is and will be solvent and able to pay all Receivables on which the Customer is obligated in full when due. With respect to such Customers of any
Loan Party who are not solvent, such Loan Party has set up on its books and in its financial records bad debt reserves adequate to cover such Receivables. 
  78 


(c) Each Loan Partys chief executive office is located as set forth on Schedule 4.4.
Until written notice is given to Administrative Agent by Borrowing Agent of any other office at which any Loan Party keeps its records pertaining to Receivables, all such records shall be kept at such executive office. 
(d) Loan Parties shall instruct their Customers to deliver all remittances upon Receivables (whether paid by check or by wire transfer of
funds) to such Blocked Account(s) and/or Depository Accounts (and any associated lockboxes) as Administrative Agent shall designate from time to time as contemplated by Section 4.8(h) or as otherwise agreed to from time to time by
Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any Loan Party directly receives any remittances upon Receivables, such Loan Party shall, at such Loan Partys sole cost and expense, but on Administrative Agents behalf
and for Administrative Agents account, collect as Administrative Agents property and in trust for Administrative Agent all amounts received on Receivables, and shall not commingle such collections with any Loan Partys funds or use
the same except to pay Obligations, and shall as soon as possible and in any event no later than one (1) Business Day after the receipt thereof (i) in the case of remittances paid by check, deposit all such remittances in their original
form (after supplying any necessary endorsements) and (ii) in the case of remittances paid by wire transfer of funds, transfer all such remittances, in each case, into such Blocked Accounts(s) and/or Depository Account(s). Each Loan Party shall
deposit in the Blocked Account and/or Depository Account or, upon request by Administrative Agent, deliver to Administrative Agent, in original form and on the date of receipt thereof, all checks, drafts, notes, money orders, acceptances, cash and
other evidences of Indebtedness.  (e) At any time following the occurrence of an Event of Default or a Default, Administrative Agent shall
have the right to send notice of the assignment of, and Administrative Agents security interest in and Lien on, the Receivables to any and all Customers or any third party holding or otherwise concerned with any of the Collateral. Thereafter,
during the continuance of an Event of Default, Administrative Agent shall have the sole right to collect the Receivables, take possession of the Collateral, or both. Administrative Agents actual collection expenses, including, but not limited
to, stationery and postage, telephone, facsimile, telegraph, secretarial and clerical expenses and the salaries of any collection personnel used for collection, may be charged to Borrowers Account and added to the Obligations. 
(f) Administrative Agent shall have the right to receive, endorse, assign and/or deliver in the name of Administrative Agent or any Loan Party
any and all checks, drafts and other instruments for the payment of money relating to the Receivables, and each Loan Party hereby waives notice of presentment, protest and non-payment of any instrument so endorsed. Each Loan Party hereby constitutes
Administrative Agent or Administrative Agents designee as such Loan Partys attorney with power (i) at any time: (A) to endorse such Loan Partys name upon any notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money orders or other
evidences of payment or Collateral; (B) to sign such Loan Partys name on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the Receivables, drafts against Customers, assignments and verifications of Receivables; (C) to send
verifications of Receivables to any Customer; (D) to sign such Loan Partys name on all financing statements or any other documents or instruments deemed necessary or appropriate by Administrative Agent to preserve, protect, or perfect
Administrative Agents interest in the Collateral and to file same; and (E) to receive, open and dispose of all mail addressed to any 
  79 



Loan Party at any post office box/lockbox maintained by Administrative Agent for Borrowers or at any other business premises of Administrative Agent; and (ii) at any time following the
occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default: (A) to demand payment of the Receivables; (B) to enforce payment of the Receivables by legal proceedings or otherwise; (C) to exercise all of such Loan Partys rights and remedies
with respect to the collection of the Receivables and any other Collateral; (D) to sue upon or otherwise collect, extend the time of payment of, settle, adjust, compromise, extend or renew the Receivables; (E) to settle, adjust or
compromise any legal proceedings brought to collect Receivables; (F) to prepare, file and sign such Loan Partys name on a proof of claim in bankruptcy or similar document against any Customer; (G) to prepare, file and sign such Loan
Partys name on any notice of Lien, assignment or satisfaction of Lien or similar document in connection with the Receivables; (H) to accept the return of goods represented by any of the Receivables; (I) to change the address for
delivery of mail addressed to any Loan Party to such address as Administrative Agent may designate; and (J) to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out this Agreement. All acts of said attorney or designee are hereby ratified and
approved, and said attorney or designee shall not be liable for any acts of omission or commission nor for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or of law, unless done maliciously or with gross (not mere) negligence (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment); this power being coupled with an interest is irrevocable while any of the Obligations remain unpaid. 
(g) Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall, under any circumstances or in any event whatsoever, have any liability for any error or
omission or delay of any kind occurring in the settlement, collection or payment of any of the Receivables or any instrument received in payment thereof, or for any damage resulting therefrom. 
(h) All proceeds of Collateral shall be deposited by Loan Parties into either (i) a lockbox account, dominion account or such other
blocked account (Blocked Accounts) established at a bank or banks (each such bank, a Blocked Account Bank) pursuant to an arrangement with such Blocked Account Bank as may be acceptable to
Administrative Agent or (ii) depository accounts established at PNC for the deposit of such proceeds (provided that such depository accounts are subject to the Liens granted in favor of Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement and
provided that such proceeds are applied in accordance with this Section 4.8(h)) (Depository Accounts). Each applicable Loan Party, Administrative Agent and each Blocked Account Bank shall enter into a deposit account control
agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent that is sufficient to give Administrative Agent control (for purposes of Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code) over such account and which directs such
Blocked Account Bank to transfer such funds so deposited on a daily basis (or at other times acceptable to Administrative Agent) to Administrative Agent, either to any account maintained by Administrative Agent at said Blocked Account Bank or by
wire transfer to appropriate account(s) at Administrative Agent. All funds deposited in such Blocked Accounts or Depository Accounts shall immediately become subject to the security interest of Administrative Agent for its own benefit and the
ratable benefit of Issuer, Lenders and all other holders of the Obligations, and Borrowing Agent shall obtain the agreement by such Blocked Account Bank to waive any offset rights against the funds so deposited. Neither Administrative Agent nor any
Lender assumes any responsibility for such blocked account arrangement, including any claim of accord and satisfaction or release with respect to deposits accepted by any Blocked Account Bank thereunder. Administrative Agent shall apply all funds
received by it 
  80 



from the Blocked Accounts and/or Depository Accounts to the satisfaction of the Obligations (including the Cash Collateralization of the Letters of Credit) in such order as Administrative Agent
shall determine in its sole discretion, provided that, in the absence of any Event of Default, Administrative Agent shall apply all such funds representing collection of Receivables first to the prepayment of the principal amount of the Swing Loans,
if any, and then to the Revolving Advances.  (i) No Loan Party will, without Administrative Agents consent, compromise or adjust any
Receivables (or extend the time for payment thereof) or accept any returns of merchandise or grant any additional discounts, allowances or credits thereon except for those compromises, adjustments, returns, discounts, credits and allowances as have
been heretofore customary in the Ordinary Course of Business of such Loan Party.  (j) All deposit accounts (including all Blocked Accounts
and Depository Accounts), securities accounts and investment accounts of each Loan Party and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date are set forth in a separate writing delivered by the Loan Parties to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the
Closing Date. No Loan Party shall open any new deposit account, securities account or investment account unless (i) Loan Parties shall have given at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Administrative Agent and (ii) if such
account is to be maintained with a bank, depository institution or securities intermediary that is not the Administrative Agent, such bank, depository institution or securities intermediary, each applicable Loan Party and Administrative Agent shall
first have entered into an account control agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent sufficient to give Administrative Agent control (for purposes of Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code) over such
account.  4.9. Inventory. 
To the extent Inventory held for sale or lease has been produced by any Loan Party, it has been and will be produced by such Loan Party in
accordance with the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, and all rules, regulations and orders thereunder.  4.10.
[Reserved].  4.11. Exculpation of Liability. 
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to constitute any Agent or any Lender as any Loan Partys agent for any purpose whatsoever,
nor shall any Agent or any Lender be responsible or liable for any shortage, discrepancy, damage, loss or destruction of any part of the Collateral wherever the same may be located and regardless of the cause thereof. Neither any Agent nor any
Lender, whether by anything herein or in any assignment or otherwise, assume any of any Loan Partys obligations under any contract or agreement assigned to such Agent or such Lender, and neither any Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible in
any way for the performance by any Loan Party of any of the terms and conditions thereof. 
  81 


4.12. Financing Statements. 
Except as respects the financing statements filed by Administrative Agent and financing statements filed in connection with Permitted
Encumbrances, no financing statement covering any of the Collateral or any proceeds thereof is or will be on file in any public office.  V.

6.1. Compliance with Laws. 
Comply with all Applicable Laws with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or to the operation of such Loan Partys business the
non-compliance with which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (except to the extent any separate provision of this Agreement shall expressly require compliance with any particular Applicable Law(s) pursuant to another
standard). Each Loan Party may, however, contest or dispute any Applicable Laws in any reasonable manner, provided that any related Lien is inchoate or stayed and sufficient reserves are established to the reasonable satisfaction of Administrative
Agent to protect Administrative Agents Lien on or security interest in the Collateral.  6.2. Conduct of Business and Maintenance
of Existence and Assets.  (a) Conduct continuously and operate actively its business according to good business practices and maintain
all of its properties useful or reasonably necessary in its business in good working order and condition (reasonable wear and tear excepted and except as may be disposed of in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), including all Intellectual

cruals for taxes, assessments, Charges, levies and claims, allowances against doubtful Receivables and accruals for depreciation, obsolescence or amortization of assets), all in accordance
with, or as required by, GAAP consistently applied in the opinion of such independent public accountant as shall then be regularly engaged by Loan Parties. 
6.4. Payment of Taxes. 
Pay, when due, all taxes, assessments and other Charges lawfully levied or assessed upon such Loan Party or any of the Collateral, including
real and personal property taxes, assessments and charges and all franchise, income, employment, social security benefits, withholding, and sales taxes except (i) to the extent any such tax, assessment or other charge is the subject of a good
faith dispute that is being diligently prosecuted and for which such Loan Party is maintaining adequate reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP and otherwise which does not result in any Lien with any priority over the security interest of the
Administrative Agent and (ii) to the extent the failure to pay when due any such tax, assessment or other charge (or any event 
  90 



or circumstance relating thereto) has not resulted in the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, unless such failure could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect
(in which case this exception shall not apply). If any tax by any Governmental Body is or may be imposed on or as a result of any transaction between any Loan Party and Administrative Agent or any Lender which Administrative Agent or any Lender may
be required to withhold or pay or if any taxes, assessments, or other Charges remain unpaid after the date fixed for their payment, or if any claim shall be made which, in Administrative Agents or any Lenders opinion, may possibly create
a valid Lien on the Collateral, Administrative Agent may without notice to Loan Parties pay the taxes, assessments or other Charges and each Loan Party hereby indemnifies and holds Administrative Agent and each Lender harmless in respect thereof.
Administrative Agent will not pay any taxes, assessments or Charges to the extent that any applicable Loan Party has Properly Contested those taxes, assessments or Charges. The amount of any payment by Administrative Agent under this

businesses similar to such Loan Party insuring against larceny, embezzlement or other criminal misappropriation of insureds officers and employees who may either singly or jointly with others at any time have access to the assets or funds of
such Loan Party either directly or through authority to draw upon such funds or to direct generally the disposition of such assets; (iii) maintain public and product liability insurance against claims for personal injury, death or property
damage suffered by others; (iv) maintain all such workers 
  91 



compensation or similar insurance as may be required under the laws of any state or jurisdiction in which such Loan Party is engaged in business; (v) furnish Administrative Agent with

Administrative Agent, naming Administrative Agent as an additional insured and mortgagee and/or lender loss payee (as applicable) as its interests may appear with respect to all insurance coverage referred to in clauses (i), and (iii) above,
and providing (I) that all proceeds thereunder shall be payable to Administrative Agent, (II) no such insurance shall be affected by any act or neglect of the insured or owner of the property described in such policy, and (III) that such policy
and loss payable clauses may not be cancelled, amended or terminated unless at least thirty (30) days prior written notice is given to Administrative Agent. In the event of any loss thereunder, the carriers named therein hereby are directed by
Administrative Agent and the applicable Loan Party to make payment for such loss to Administrative Agent and not to such Loan Party and Administrative Agent jointly. If any insurance losses are paid by check, draft or other instrument payable to any
Loan Party and Administrative Agent jointly, Administrative Agent may endorse such Loan Partys name thereon and do such other things as Administrative Agent may deem advisable to reduce the same to cash. 
(b) Each Loan Party shall take all actions required under the Flood Laws and/or requested by Administrative Agent to assist in ensuring that
each Lender is in compliance with the Flood Laws applicable to the Collateral, including, but not limited to, providing Administrative Agent with the address and/or GPS coordinates of each structure on any real property that will be subject to a
mortgage in favor of Agent, for the benefit of Agents and Lenders, and, to the extent required, obtaining flood insurance for such property, structures and contents prior to such property, structures and contents becoming Collateral, and thereafter
maintaining such flood insurance in full force and effect for so long as required by the Flood Laws.  (c) Administrative Agent is hereby
authorized to adjust and compromise claims under insurance coverage referred to in Sections 6.6(a)(i), above. All loss recoveries received by Administrative Agent under any such insurance shall be applied to the Advances (x) first, to the
outstanding principal installments of the Term Loan in the inverse order of the maturities thereof and (y) second, to the remaining Advances in such order as Co-Collateral Agents may determine. Any surplus shall be paid by Administrative Agent
to Borrowers or applied as may be otherwise required by law. Any deficiency thereon shall be paid by Borrowers to Administrative Agent, on demand. Anything hereinabove to the contrary notwithstanding, and subject to the fulfillment of the conditions
set forth below, Administrative Agent shall remit to Borrowing Agent insurance proceeds received by Administrative Agent during any calendar year under insurance policies procured and maintained by Loan Parties which insure Loan Parties
insurable properties to the extent such insurance proceeds do not exceed One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in the aggregate during such calendar year or Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($500,000.00) per occurrence. In the event
the amount of insurance proceeds received by Administrative Agent for any occurrence exceeds Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($500,000.00), then Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to remit the insurance proceeds to Borrowing Agent
unless Borrowing Agent shall provide Administrative Agent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent that 
  92 



the insurance proceeds will be used by Loan Parties to repair, replace or restore the insured property which was the subject of the insurable loss. In the event Borrowing Agent has previously
received (or, after giving effect to any proposed remittance by Administrative Agent to Borrowing Agent would receive) insurance proceeds which equal or exceed One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in the aggregate during any calendar year,
then Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, either remit the insurance proceeds to Borrowing Agent upon Borrowing Agent providing Administrative Agent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent that the insurance
proceeds will be used by Loan Parties to repair, replace or restore the insured property which was the subject of the insurable loss, or apply the proceeds to the Obligations, as aforesaid. The agreement of Administrative Agent to remit insurance
proceeds in the manner above provided shall be subject in each instance to satisfaction of each of the following conditions: (x) No Event of Default or Default shall then have occurred, (y) Loan Parties shall use such insurance proceeds
promptly to repair, replace or restore the insurable property which was the subject of the insurable loss and for no other purpose, and (z) such remittances shall be made under such procedures as Administrative Agent may establish. If any Loan
Party fails to obtain insurance as hereinabove provided, or to keep the same in force, Administrative Agent, if Administrative Agent so elects, may obtain such insurance and pay the premium therefor on behalf of such Loan Party, which payments shall
be charged to Borrowers Account and constitute part of the obligations.  6.7. Payment of Indebtedness and Leasehold
Obligations.  Pay, discharge or otherwise satisfy (i) at or before maturity (subject, where applicable, to specified grace
periods) all its Indebtedness, except when the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or when the amount or validity thereof is currently being Properly Contested, subject at all times to any applicable
subordination arrangement in favor of Lenders and (ii) when due its rental obligations under all leases under which it is a tenant, and shall otherwise comply, in all material respects, with all other terms of such leases and keep them in full
force and effect except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or when the amount or validity thereof is currently being Properly Contested. 
6.8. Environmental Matters. 
(a) Ensure that the Real Property and all operations and businesses conducted thereon are in compliance and remain in compliance with all
Environmental Laws and it shall manage any and all Hazardous Materials on any Real Property in compliance with Environmental Laws except to the extent the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 (b) Establish and maintain an environmental management and compliance system to assure and monitor continued compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws. All potential violations and violations of Environmental Laws shall be reviewed with in-house or external legal counsel to determine any required reporting to applicable Governmental Bodies and any required corrective
actions to address such potential violations or violations. 
  93 


(c) Respond promptly to any Hazardous Discharge or Environmental Complaint and take all necessary
action in order to safeguard the health of any Person and to avoid subjecting the Collateral or Real Property to any Lien. If any Loan Party shall fail to respond promptly to any Hazardous Discharge or Environmental Complaint or any Loan Party shall
fail to comply with any of the requirements of any Environmental Laws, Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders may, but without the obligation to do so, for the sole purpose of protecting Administrative Agents interest in the Collateral:
(i) give such notices or (ii) enter onto the Real Property (or authorize third parties to enter onto the Real Property) and take such actions as Administrative Agent (or such third parties as directed by Administrative Agent) deem
reasonably necessary or advisable, to remediate, remove, mitigate or otherwise manage with any such Hazardous Discharge or Environmental Complaint. All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Administrative Agent and Lenders (or such third
parties) in the exercise of any such rights, including any sums paid in connection with any judicial or administrative investigation or proceedings, fines and penalties, together with interest thereon from the date expended at the Default Rate for
Domestic Rate Loans constituting Revolving Advances shall be paid upon demand by Borrowers, and until paid shall be added to and become a part of the Obligations secured by the Liens created by the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement
between any Agent, any Lender and any Borrower.  (d) In the event that Administrative Agent in good faith has reason to believe that a
material Hazardous Discharge has occurred on any Real Property, Loan Parties shall, at Administrative Agents request in its Permitted Discretion, provide Administrative Agent with an environmental site assessment or environmental compliance
audit report prepared by an environmental engineering firm acceptable in the reasonable opinion of Administrative Agent, to assess with a reasonable degree of certainty the existence of a Hazardous Discharge and the potential costs in connection
with abatement, remediation and removal of any Hazardous Materials found on, under, at or within the Real Property. Any report or investigation of such Hazardous Discharge proposed and acceptable to the responsible Governmental Body shall be
acceptable to Administrative Agent. If such estimates, individually or in the aggregate, exceed One Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($100,000.00), Administrative Agent shall have the right to require Borrowers to post a bond, letter of credit or
other security reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent to secure payment of these costs and expenses.  6.9. Standards of
Financial Statements.  Cause all financial statements referred to in Sections 9.7 and 9.8 as to which GAAP is applicable to be complete
and correct in all material respects (subject, in the case of interim financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments) and to be prepared in reasonable detail and in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods
reflected therein (except as disclosed therein and agreed to by such reporting accountants or officer, as applicable).

obligations under this Section 6.15, or otherwise under this Agreement or any Other Document, voidable under applicable law, including applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The
obligations of each Qualified ECP Loan Party under this Section 6.15 shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement and the Other Documents. Each Qualified ECP Loan Party intends

XI. LENDERS RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AFTER DEFAULT. 
11.1. Rights and Remedies. 
(a) Upon the occurrence of: (i) an Event of Default pursuant to Section 10.7 (other than Section 10.7(vii)), all Obligations
shall be immediately due and payable and this Agreement and the obligation of Lenders to make Advances shall be deemed terminated, (ii) any of the other Events of Default and at any time thereafter, at the option of Administrative Agent or at
the direction of Required Lenders all Obligations shall be immediately due and payable and Administrative Agent or Required Lenders shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and to terminate the obligation of Lenders to make Advances; and
(iii) without limiting Section 8.2 hereof, any Default under Sections 10.7(vii) hereof, the obligation of Lenders to make Advances hereunder shall be suspended until such time as such involuntary petition shall be dismissed. Upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default, Administrative Agent shall have the right to exercise any and all rights and remedies provided for herein, under the Other Documents, under the Uniform Commercial Code, any Applicable Laws and at law or equity
generally, including the right to foreclose the security interests granted herein and to realize upon any Collateral by any available judicial procedure and/or to take possession of and sell any or all of the Collateral with or without judicial
process. Administrative Agent may enter any of any Loan Partys premises or other premises without legal process and without incurring liability to any Loan Party therefor, and Administrative Agent may thereupon, or at any time thereafter, in
its discretion without notice or demand, take the Collateral and remove the same to such place as Administrative Agent may deem advisable and Administrative Agent may require Loan Parties to make the Collateral available to Administrative Agent at a
convenient place. With or without having the Collateral at the time or place of sale, Administrative Agent may sell the Collateral, or any part thereof, at public or private sale, at any time or place, in one or more sales, at such price or prices,
and upon such terms, either for cash, credit or future delivery, as Administrative Agent may elect. Except as to that part of the Collateral which is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a
recognized market, Administrative Agent shall give Loan Parties reasonable notification of such sale or sales, it being agreed that in all events written notice mailed to Borrowing Agent at least ten (10) days prior to such sale or sales is
reasonable notification. At any public sale Administrative Agent or any Lender may bid (including credit bid) for and become the purchaser, and Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other purchaser at any such sale thereafter shall hold the
Collateral sold absolutely free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity of redemption and all such claims, rights and equities are hereby expressly waived and released by each Loan Party. In connection with the exercise of
the foregoing remedies, including the sale of Inventory, Administrative Agent is granted a perpetual nonrevocable, royalty free, nonexclusive license and Administrative Agent is granted permission to use all of each Loan Partys
(a) Intellectual Property which is used or useful in connection with Inventory for the purpose of marketing, advertising for sale and selling or otherwise disposing of such Inventory and (b) equipment for the purpose of completing the
manufacture of unfinished goods. The cash proceeds realized from the sale of any Collateral shall be applied to the Obligations in the order set forth in Section 11.5 hereof. Noncash proceeds will only be applied to the Obligations as they are
converted into cash. If any deficiency shall arise, Loan Parties shall remain liable to Administrative Agent and Lenders therefor. 
  115 


(b) To the extent that Applicable Law imposes duties on Administrative Agent to exercise remedies
in a commercially reasonable manner, each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that it is not commercially unreasonable for Administrative Agent: (i) to fail to incur expenses reasonably deemed significant by Administrative Agent to prepare
Collateral for disposition or otherwise to complete raw material or work in process into finished goods or other finished products for disposition; (ii) to fail to obtain third party consents for access to Collateral to be disposed of, or to
obtain or, if not required by other law, to fail to obtain governmental or third party consents for the collection or disposition of Collateral to be collected or disposed of; (iii) to fail to exercise collection remedies against Customers or
other Persons obligated on Collateral or to remove Liens on or any adverse claims against Collateral; (iv) to exercise collection remedies against Customers and other Persons obligated on Collateral directly or through the use of collection
agencies and other collection specialists; (v) to advertise dispositions of Collateral through publications or media of general circulation, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature; (vi) to contact other Persons, whether
or not in the same business as any Loan Party, for expressions of interest in acquiring all or any portion of such Collateral; (vii) to hire one or more professional auctioneers to assist in the disposition of Collateral, whether or not the
Collateral is of a specialized nature; (viii) to dispose of Collateral by utilizing internet sites that provide for the auction of assets of the types included in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capacity of doing so, or that match
buyers and sellers of assets; (ix) to dispose of assets in wholesale rather than retail markets; (x) to disclaim disposition warranties, such as title, possession or quiet enjoyment, (xi) to purchase insurance or credit enhancements
to insure Administrative Agent against risks of loss, collection or disposition of Collateral or to provide to Administrative Agent a guaranteed return from the collection or disposition of Collateral; or (xii) to the extent deemed appropriate
by the Administrative Agent, to obtain the services of other brokers, investment bankers, consultants and other professionals to assist Administrative Agent in the collection or disposition of any of the Collateral. Each Loan Party acknowledges that
the purpose of this Section 11.1(b) is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by Administrative Agent would not be commercially unreasonable in Administrative Agents exercise of remedies against the Collateral
and that other actions or omissions by Administrative Agent shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely on account of not being indicated in this Section 11.1(b). Without limitation upon the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Section 11.1(b) shall be construed to grant any rights to any Loan Party or to impose any duties on Administrative Agent that would not have been granted or imposed by this Agreement or by Applicable Law in the absence of this
Section 11.1(b).  11.2. Administrative Agents Discretion. 
Administrative Agent shall have the right in its sole discretion to determine which rights, Liens, security interests or remedies
Administrative Agent may at any time pursue, relinquish, subordinate, or modify, which procedures, timing and methodologies to employ, and what any other action to take with respect to any or all of the Collateral and in what order, thereto and such
determination will not in any way modify or affect any of Administrative Agents or Lenders rights hereunder as against Loan Parties or each other. 
  116 


11.3. Setoff. 
Subject to Section 14.13, in addition to any other rights which Administrative Agent or any Lender may have under Applicable Law, upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder, Administrative Agent and such Lender shall have a right, immediately and without notice of any kind, to apply any Loan Partys property held by Administrative Agent and such Lender or any of their
Affiliates to reduce the Obligations and to exercise any and all rights of setoff which may be available to Administrative Agent and such Lender with respect to any deposits held by Administrative Agent or such Lender. 
11.4. Rights and Remedies not Exclusive. 
The enumeration of the foregoing rights and remedies is not intended to be exhaustive and the exercise of any rights or remedy shall not
preclude the exercise of any other right or remedies provided for herein or otherwise provided by law, all of which shall be cumulative and not alternative. 
11.5. Allocation of Payments After Event of Default. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, after the acceleration of the Obligations or an exercise of secured
creditor remedies pursuant to Section 11.1 (other than the exercise of control over deposit accounts pursuant to a deposit account control agreement), all amounts collected or received by Administrative Agent on account of the Obligations
(including without limitation any amounts on account of any of Cash Management Liabilities or Hedge Liabilities), or in respect of the Collateral shall be paid over or delivered as follows: 
FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of Agents in connection
with enforcing its rights and the rights of Lenders under this Agreement and the Other Documents, and any Out-of-Formula Loans and Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent with respect to the Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement;  SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to Administrative Agent; 
THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of each of the Lenders to
the extent owing to such Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;  FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Obligations consisting of
accrued interest on account of the Swing Loans;  FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Obligations consisting
of Swing Loans; 
  117 


SIXTH, to the payment of all Obligations arising under this Agreement and the Other Documents
consisting of accrued fees and interest (other than interest in respect of Swing Loans paid pursuant to clause FOURTH above);  SEVENTH, to
the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Obligations (other than principal in respect of Swing Loans paid pursuant to clause FIFTH above) arising under this Agreement (including (i) Cash Management Liabilities and Hedge
Liabilities to the extent a reserve for such amount has been included in the Formula Amount and (ii) the payment or Cash Collateralization of any outstanding Letters of Credit in accordance with Section 3.2(b) hereof); 
EIGHTH, to all other Obligations arising under this Agreement (including Cash Management Liabilities and Hedge Liabilities) which shall have
become due and payable (hereunder, under the Other Documents or otherwise) and not repaid pursuant to clauses FIRST through SEVENTH above; and 
NINTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. 
In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application
to the next succeeding category; (ii) each of the applicable Lenders shall receive (so long as it is not a Defaulting Lender) an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding applicable Advances, Cash
Management Liabilities and Hedge Liabilities held by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding applicable Advances, Cash Management Liabilities and Hedge Liabilities) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses
SIXTH, SEVENTH and EIGHTH above; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.5, no Swap Obligations of any Non-Qualifying Party shall be paid with amounts received from such
Non-Qualifying Party under its Guaranty (including sums received as a result of the exercise of remedies with respect to such Guaranty) or from the proceeds of such Non-Qualifying Partys Collateral if such Swap Obligations would constitute
Excluded Hedge Liabilities, provided, however, that to the extent possible appropriate adjustments shall be made with respect to payments and/or the proceeds of Collateral from other Borrowers and/or Guarantors that are Eligible Contract
Participants with respect to such Swap Obligations to preserve the allocation to Obligations otherwise set forth above in this Section 11.5; and (iv) to the extent that any amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause
SEVENTH above are attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be held by Administrative Agent as cash collateral for the Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 3.2(b) hereof and
applied (A) first, to reimburse Issuer from time to time for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B) then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of the types described in clauses
SEVENTH and EIGHTH above in the manner provided in this Section 11.5. 
  118 


XII. WAIVERS AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.

  119 


13.2. Termination.

Obligations of each Loan Party have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full after the termination of this Agreement or each Loan Party has furnished Administrative Agent and Lenders with an indemnification satisfactory to Administrative Agent
and Lenders with respect thereto. Accordingly, each Loan Party waives any rights which it may have under the Uniform Commercial Code to demand the filing of termination statements with respect to the Collateral, and Administrative Agent shall not be
required to send such termination statements to each Loan Party, or to file them with any filing office, unless and until this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms and all Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full

XIV. REGARDING AGENT.  14.1. Appointment.
 Each Lender hereby designates (i) PNC to act as Administrative Agent for such Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents,
and (ii) PNC and Bank of America to act as Co-Collateral Agents under this Agreement and the Other Documents. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes each Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the
Other Documents and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of each Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto and
Administrative Agent shall hold all Collateral, payments of principal and interest, fees (except the fees set forth in Sections 2.8(b), 3.3 and the Fee Letter), charges and collections received pursuant to this Agreement, for the ratable benefit of
Lenders. Each Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its agents or employees. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement (including collection of the Note) Administrative Agent shall not be required to
exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be
binding; provided, however, that Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which, in such Agents discretion, exposes Administrative Agent to liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or the Other Documents or
Applicable Law unless Administrative Agent is furnished with an indemnification reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent with respect thereto. 
  120 


14.2. Nature of Duties. 
No Agent shall have duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Other Documents. Neither any Agent
nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be (i) liable for any action taken or omitted by them as such hereunder or in connection herewith, unless caused by their gross (not mere) negligence or willful
misconduct, or (ii) responsible in any manner for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement, or in any of the Other Documents or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any of the Other Documents or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, due execution, enforceability or
sufficiency of this Agreement, or any of the Other Documents or for any failure of any Loan Party to perform its obligations hereunder. No Agent shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any of the Other Documents, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party. The duties of Administrative Agent as respects the Advances to
Borrowers shall be mechanical and administrative in nature. No Agent shall have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender; and nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so
construed as to impose upon any Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein.  14.3. Lack of
Reliance on Agent.  Independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, each Lender has made and shall continue to
make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of each Borrower and each Guarantor in connection with the making and the continuance of the Advances hereunder and the taking or not taking of any action in
connection herewith, and (ii) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Borrower and each Guarantor. Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any
credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before making of the Advances or at any time or times thereafter except as shall be provided by any Loan Party pursuant to the terms hereof. Administrative Agent
shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in any agreement, document, certificate or a statement delivered in connection with or for the execution, effectiveness,
genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any Other Document, or of the financial condition of any Borrower or any Guarantor, or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or
observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement, the Note, the Other Documents or the financial condition or prospects of any Loan Party, or the existence of any Event of Default or any Default. 
  121 


14.4. Resignation of Agents; Successor Agents. 
Administrative Agent may resign on sixty (60) days written notice to each Lender and Borrowing Agent and upon such resignation, Required
Lenders will promptly designate a successor Administrative Agent reasonably satisfactory to Loan Parties (provided that no such approval by Loan Parties shall be required (i) in any case where the successor Administrative Agent is one of the
Lenders or (ii) after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default). Any such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of Administrative Agent, and shall in particular succeed to all of
Administrative Agents right, title and interest in and to all of the Liens in the Collateral securing the Obligations created hereunder or any Other Document (including the Pledge Agreements and all account control agreements), and the term
Administrative Agent shall mean such successor agent effective upon its appointment, and the former Administrative Agents rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or
deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time of the effectiveness of the new Administrative Agents appointment, any further actions need to be taken in order to provide for the
legally binding and valid transfer of any Liens in the Collateral from former Administrative Agent to new Administrative Agent and/or for the perfection of any Liens in the Collateral as held by new Administrative Agent or it is otherwise not then
possible for new Administrative Agent to become the holder of a fully valid, enforceable and perfected Lien as to any of the Collateral, former Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such Liens solely as agent for perfection of such Liens on
behalf of new Administrative Agent until such time as new Administrative Agent can obtain a fully valid, enforceable and perfected Lien on all Collateral, provided that Administrative Agent shall not be required to or have any liability or
responsibility to take any further actions after such date as such agent for perfection to continue the perfection of any such Liens (other than to forego from taking any affirmative action to release any such Liens). After any Administrative
Agents resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article XIV, and any indemnification rights under this Agreement, including without limitation, rights arising under Section 16.5 hereof, shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement (and in the event resigning Administrative Agent continues to hold any Liens pursuant to the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, the
provisions of this Article XIV and any indemnification rights under this Agreement, including without limitation, rights arising under Section 16.5 hereof, shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it in
connection with such Liens).  Any Co-Collateral Agent may resign on sixty (60) days written notice to each of Lenders and
Borrowing Agent and upon the resignation of both Co-Collateral Agents (but not upon the resignation of only one Co-Collateral Agent), the Required Lenders (without giving effect to the Revolving Commitment Percentage or Term Loan Commitment
Percentage of the Lenders who are resigning as Co-Collateral Agents) will promptly designate a successor Co-Collateral Agent in consultation with the Borrowers.

14.5. Certain Rights of Administrative Agent. 
If Administrative Agent shall request instructions from Lenders with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with
this Agreement or any Other Document, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until Administrative Agent shall have received instructions from Required Lenders; and Administrative Agent shall
not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, Lenders shall not have any right of action whatsoever against Administrative Agent as a result of its acting or refraining from acting hereunder in
accordance with the instructions of Required Lenders.  14.6. Reliance. 
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, statement,
certificate, email, facsimile, telex, teletype or telecopier message, cablegram, order or other document or telephone message believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or entity, and, with
respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and the Other Documents and its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it. Administrative Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be liable for the default
or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by Administrative Agent with reasonable care.  14.7. Notice of
Default.  Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder or under the Other Documents, unless Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or Borrowing Agent referring to this Agreement or the Other Documents, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is
a notice of default. In the event that Administrative Agent receives such a notice, Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to Lenders. Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default
as shall be reasonably directed by Required Lenders; provided, that, unless and until Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of Lenders.  14.8.
Indemnification.  To the extent an Agent is not reimbursed and indemnified by Loan Parties, each Lender will reimburse and indemnify
such Agent in proportion to its respective portion of the outstanding Advances and its respective Participation Commitments in the outstanding Letters of Credit and outstanding Swing Loans (or, if no Advances are outstanding, pro rata according to
the percentage that its Revolving Commitment Amount constitutes of the total aggregate Revolving Commitment Amounts), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in performing its duties hereunder, or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any Other Document; provided that
Lenders shall not be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Agents gross (not mere) negligence or willful misconduct
(as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment). 
  123 


14.9. Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. 
With respect to the obligation of Administrative Agent to lend under this Agreement, the Advances made by it shall have the same rights and
powers hereunder as any other Lender and as if it were not performing the duties as Administrative Agent specified herein; and the term Lender or any similar term shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include
Administrative Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender. Administrative Agent may engage in business with any Loan Party as if it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from any Loan Party
for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders.  14.10. Delivery of
Documents.  To the extent (i) Administrative Agent or either Co-Collateral Agent, as applicable, receives financial statements
required under Sections 9.7, 9.8, 9.9 and 9.13, Borrowing Base Certificates or the results of any field examination or appraisal from any Loan Party under the terms of this Agreement or (ii) Administrative Agent receives any other notification
or communication that it deems material in its Permitted Discretion under the terms of this Agreement, in each case which any Loan Party is not obligated to deliver to each Lender, Administrative Agent or such Co-Collateral Agent, as applicable,
will promptly furnish such documents and information to Lenders.  14.11. Loan Parties Undertaking to Administrative Agent.
 Without prejudice to their respective obligations to Lenders under the other provisions of this Agreement, each Loan Party hereby
undertakes with Administrative Agent to pay to Administrative Agent from time to time on demand all amounts from time to time due and payable by it for the account of Administrative Agent or Lenders or any of them pursuant to this Agreement to the
extent not already paid. Any payment made pursuant to any such demand shall pro tanto satisfy the relevant Loan Partys obligations to make payments for the account of Lenders or the relevant one or more of them pursuant to this Agreement. 
14.12. No Reliance on Administrative Agents Customer Identification Program. 
To the extent the Advances or this Agreement is, or becomes, syndicated in cooperation with other Lenders, each Lender acknowledges and agrees
that neither such Lender, nor any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees, may rely on Administrative Agent to carry out such Lenders, Affiliates, participants or assignees customer identification program, or other
obligations required or imposed under or pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act or the regulations thereunder, including the regulations contained in 31 CFR 103.121 (as hereafter amended or replaced, the CIP Regulations), or any
other Anti-Terrorism Law, including any programs involving any of the following items relating to or in connection with any of Loan Parties, their Affiliates or their agents, the Other Documents or the
transactions hereunder or contemplated hereby: (i) any identity verification procedures, (ii) any recordkeeping, (iii) comparisons with government lists, (iv) customer notices or (v) other procedures required under the CIP
Regulations or such Anti-Terrorism Laws. 
  124 


14.13. Other Agreements. 
Each of the Lenders agrees that it shall not, without the express consent of Administrative Agent, set off against the Obligations, any amounts
owing by such Lender to any Loan Party or any deposit accounts of any Loan Party now or hereafter maintained with such Lender. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, each of the Lenders further agrees that it shall not, unless
specifically requested to do so by Administrative Agent, take any action to protect or enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement or the Other Documents, it being the intent of Lenders that any such action to protect or enforce rights under
this Agreement and the Other Documents shall be taken in concert and at the direction or with the consent of Administrative Agent or Required Lenders. 
XV. BORROWING AGENCY.  15.1. Borrowing Agency
Provisions.  (a) Each Loan Party hereby irrevocably designates Borrowing Agent to be its attorney and agent and in such capacity to
(i) borrow, (ii) request advances, (iii) request the issuance of Letters of Credit, (iv) sign and endorse notes, (v) execute and deliver all instruments, documents, applications, security agreements, reimbursement agreements
and letter of credit agreements for Letters of Credit and all other certificates, notice, writings and further assurances now or hereafter required hereunder, (vi) make elections regarding interest rates, (vii) give instructions regarding
Letters of Credit and agree with Issuer upon any amendment, extension or renewal of any Letter of Credit and (viii) otherwise take action under and in connection with this Agreement and the Other Documents, all on behalf of and in the name such
Loan Party or Loan Parties, and hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to pay over or credit all loan proceeds hereunder in accordance with the request of Borrowing Agent. 
(b) The handling of this credit facility as a co-borrowing facility with a borrowing agent in the manner set forth in this Agreement is solely
as an accommodation to Loan Parties and at their request. Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur liability to Loan Parties as a result thereof. To induce Administrative Agent and Lenders to do so and in consideration thereof, each
Loan Party hereby indemnifies Administrative Agent and each Lender and holds Administrative Agent and each Lender harmless from and against any and all liabilities, expenses, losses, damages and claims of damage or injury asserted against
Administrative Agent or any Lender by any Person arising from or incurred by reason of the handling of the financing arrangements of Loan Parties as provided herein, reliance by Administrative Agent or any Lender on any request or instruction from
Borrowing Agent or any other action taken by Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to this Section 15.1 except due to willful misconduct or gross (not mere) negligence by the indemnified party (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment).  (c) All Obligations shall be joint and several, and each Loan Party shall make
payment upon the maturity of the Obligations by acceleration or otherwise, and such obligation and liability on the part of each Loan Party shall in no way be affected by any extensions, renewals and forbearance granted by Administrative Agent or
any Lender to any Loan Party, failure of Administrative Agent or any Lender to give any Loan Party notice of borrowing or any 
  125 



other notice, any failure of Administrative Agent or any Lender to pursue or preserve its rights against any Loan Party, the release by Administrative Agent or any Lender of any Collateral now or
thereafter acquired from any Loan Party, and such agreement by each Loan Party to pay upon any notice issued pursuant thereto is unconditional and unaffected by prior recourse by Administrative Agent or any Lender to the other Loan Parties or any
Collateral for such Loan Partys Obligations or the lack thereof. Each Loan Party waives all suretyship defenses.  15.2. Waiver of
Subrogation.  Each Loan Party expressly waives any and all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnity, exoneration, contribution
of any other claim which such Loan Party may now or hereafter have against the other Loan Parties or any other Person directly or contingently liable for the Obligations hereunder, or against or with respect to any other Loan Parties property
(including, without limitation, any property which is Collateral for the Obligations), arising from the existence or performance of this Agreement, until termination of this Agreement and repayment in full of the Obligations. 
XVI. MISCELLANEOUS.  16.1. Governing Law.
 This Agreement and each Other Document (unless and except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in any such Other Document), and all
matters relating hereto or thereto or arising herefrom or therefrom (whether arising under contract law, tort law or otherwise) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Any judicial
proceeding brought by or against any Loan Party with respect to any of the Obligations, this Agreement, the Other Documents or any related agreement may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United
States of America, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Loan Party accepts for itself and in connection with its properties, generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts, and irrevocably
agrees to be bound by any judgment rendered thereby in connection with this Agreement. Each Loan Party hereby waives personal service of any and all process upon it and consents that all such service of process may be made by certified or registered
mail (return receipt requested) directed to Borrowing Agent at its address set forth in Section 16.6 and service so made shall be deemed completed five (5) days after the same shall have been so deposited in the mail of the United States
of America, or, at Administrative Agents option, by service upon Borrowing Agent which each Loan Party irrevocably appoints as such Loan Partys agent for the purpose of accepting service within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Nothing
herein shall affect the right to serve process in any manner permitted by law or shall limit the right of Administrative Agent or any Lender to bring proceedings against any Loan Party in the courts of any other jurisdiction. Each Loan Party waives
any objection to jurisdiction and venue of any action instituted hereunder and shall not assert any defense based on lack of jurisdiction or venue or based upon forum non conveniens. Each Loan Party waives the right to remove any judicial proceeding
brought against such Loan Party in any state court to any federal court. Any judicial proceeding by any Loan Party against Administrative Agent or any Lender involving, directly or indirectly, any matter or claim in any way arising out of, related
to or connected with this Agreement or any related agreement, shall be brought only in a federal or state court located in the County of Allegheny, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
  126 


16.2. Entire Understanding. 
(a) This Agreement and the documents executed concurrently herewith contain the entire understanding between each Loan Party, each Agent and
each Lender and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, if any, relating to the subject matter hereof. Any promises, representations, warranties or guarantees not herein contained and hereinafter made shall have no force and effect
unless in writing, signed by each Loan Partys, Administrative Agents and each Lenders respective officers. Neither this Agreement nor any portion or provisions hereof may be changed, modified, amended, waived, supplemented,
discharged, cancelled or terminated orally or by any course of dealing, or in any manner other than by an agreement in writing, signed by the party to be charged. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Administrative Agent may modify this Agreement or any
of the Other Documents for the purposes of completing missing content or correcting erroneous content of an administrative nature, without the need for a written amendment, provided that the Administrative Agent shall send a copy of any such
modification to the Loan Parties and each Lender (which copy may be provided by electronic mail). Each Loan Party acknowledges that it has been advised by counsel in connection with the execution of this Agreement and Other Documents and is not
relying upon oral representations or statements inconsistent with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.  (b) Required Lenders,
Administrative Agent with the consent in writing of Required Lenders (or Administrative Agent without the consent of Required Lenders pursuant to Section 2.24(vi)), and Loan Parties may, subject to the provisions of this Section 16.2(b),
from time to time enter into written supplemental agreements to this Agreement or the Other Documents executed by Loan Parties, for the purpose of adding or deleting any provisions or otherwise changing, varying or waiving in any manner the rights
of Lenders, Administrative Agent or Loan Parties thereunder or the conditions, provisions or terms thereof or waiving any Event of Default thereunder, but only to the extent specified in such written agreements; provided, however, that no such
supplemental agreement shall:  (i) increase the Revolving Commitment Percentage or the Term Loan Commitment Percentage, as applicable, or
the maximum dollar amount of the Revolving Commitment Amount or Term Loan Commitment Amount, as applicable, of any Lender without the consent of such Lender directly affected thereby; 
(ii) whether or not any Advances are outstanding, (x) extend the Term or the time for payment of principal or interest of any Advance
(excluding the due date of any mandatory prepayment of an Advance), or any fee payable to any Lender, or reduce the principal amount of or the rate of interest borne by any Advances or reduce any fee payable to any Lender, without the consent of
each Lender directly affected thereby (except that Required Lenders may elect to waive or rescind any imposition of the Default Rate under Section 3.1 or of default rates of Letter of Credit fees under Section 3.2 (unless imposed by
Administrative Agent) or (y) extend the time for payment of any mandatory prepayment of an Advance, without the consent of each Co-Collateral Agent; 
  127 


(iii) except in connection with any increase pursuant to Section 2.24 hereof, increase the
Maximum Revolving Advance Amount without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;  (iv) alter the definition of the term
Required Lenders or alter, amend or modify this Section 16.2(b) without the consent of all Lenders;  (v) alter the definition of the
term Supermajority Lenders without the consent of all Lenders;  (vi) alter, amend or modify the provisions of Section 11.5 without
the consent of all Lenders;  (vii) release any Collateral during any calendar year (other than in connection with dispositions of
Collateral permitted under Section 7.1 or in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement) having an aggregate value in excess of Two Million and 00/100 Dollars ($2,000,000.00) without the consent of all Lenders; 
(viii) change the rights and duties of any Agent without the consent of all Lenders; 
(ix) permit any Revolving Advance to be made if after giving effect thereto the total of Revolving Advances outstanding hereunder, plus the
then outstanding Swing Loans and the Maximum Undrawn Amount of Letters of Credit would exceed the Formula Amount for more than sixty (60) consecutive Business Days or exceed the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount or one hundred and ten percent
(110%) of the Formula Amount without the consent of all Lenders;  (x) terminate or reduce the amount of the Availability Block
without the consent of all Lenders;  (xi) increase the Advance Rates above the Advance Rates in effect on the Closing Date or change any
of the other definitions used in the calculation of the Formula Amount in a manner that could increase the availability of any Revolving Advances under Section 2.1 without the consent of the Co-Collateral Agents and the Supermajority Lenders;
provided that the use by the Co-Collateral Agents of their Permitted Discretion to make adjustments to eligibility criteria or to impose or remove reserves, in each case in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall not require the
consent of any Lender; or  (xii) release any Guarantor or Borrower without the consent of all Lenders. 
(c) Any such supplemental agreement shall apply equally to each Lender and shall be binding upon Loan Parties, Lenders and Agents and all
future holders of the Obligations. In the case of any waiver, Loan Parties, Agents and Lenders shall be restored to their former positions and rights, and any Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing, but no waiver of a
specific Event of Default shall extend to any subsequent Event of Default (whether or not the subsequent Event of Default is the same as the Event of Default which was waived), or impair any right consequent thereon. 
  128 


(d) In the event that Administrative Agent requests the consent of a Lender pursuant to this
Section 16.2 and such consent is denied, then Administrative Agent may, at its option, require such Lender to assign its interest in the Advances to Administrative Agent or to another Lender or to any other Person designated by Administrative
Agent (the Designated Lender), for a price equal to (i) the then outstanding principal amount thereof plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest and fees due such Lender, which interest and fees shall be paid when collected
from Borrowers. In the event Administrative Agent elects to require any Lender to assign its interest to Administrative Agent or to the Designated Lender, Administrative Agent will so notify such Lender in writing within forty five (45) days
following such Lenders denial, and such Lender will assign its interest to Administrative Agent or the Designated Lender no later than five (5) days following receipt of such notice pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement executed by
such Lender, Administrative Agent or the Designated Lender, as appropriate, and Administrative Agent.  (e) Notwithstanding (i) the
existence of a Default or an Event of Default, (ii) that any of the other applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 8.2 hereof have not been satisfied or the commitments of Lenders to make Revolving Advances hereunder have been
terminated for any reason, or (iii) any other contrary provision of this Agreement, Administrative Agent may at its discretion and without the consent of any Lender, voluntarily permit the outstanding Revolving Advances at any time to exceed
the Formula Amount by up to the difference between (I) ten percent (10%) of the Formula Amount, minus (II) the aggregate amount of Protective Advances outstanding, for up to sixty (60) consecutive Business Days (the
Out-of-Formula Loans). If Administrative Agent is willing in its sole and absolute discretion to permit such Out-of-Formula Loans, Lenders holding the Revolving Commitments shall be obligated to fund such Out-of-Formula Loans in
accordance with their respective Revolving Commitment Percentages, and such Out-of-Formula Loans shall be payable on demand and shall bear interest at the Default Rate for Revolving Advances consisting of Domestic Rate Loans; provided
that (x) if Administrative Agent does permit Out-of-Formula Loans, neither Administrative Agent nor Lenders shall be deemed thereby to have changed the limits of Section 2.1(a) nor shall any Lender be obligated to fund Revolving
Advances in excess of its Revolving Commitment Amount and (y) the Administrative Agents authorization to make such voluntary Out-of-Formula Loans may be revoked at any time upon delivery of written notice of such revocation by (i) if
there are three (3) or more Lenders, the Required Lenders or (ii) if there are fewer than three (3) Lenders, by any Lender with a Revolving Commitment Percentage of at least fifty percent (50%). For purposes of this paragraph, the
discretion granted to Administrative Agent hereunder shall not preclude involuntary overadvances that may result from time to time due to the fact that the Formula Amount was unintentionally exceeded for any reason, including, but not limited to,
Collateral previously deemed to be Eligible Receivables, Eligible Insured Foreign Receivables, WIP/FG Eligible Inventory, RM Eligible Inventory or Supplies/Materials Eligible Inventory, as
applicable, becomes ineligible, collections of Receivables applied to reduce outstanding Revolving Advances are thereafter returned for insufficient funds or overadvances are made to protect or preserve the Collateral. In the event Administrative
Agent involuntarily permits the outstanding Revolving Advances (including any Out-of-Formula Loans and Protective Advances) to exceed the Formula Amount by more than 
  129 



ten percent (10%), Administrative Agent shall use its efforts to have Borrowers decrease such excess in as expeditious a manner as is practicable under the circumstances and not inconsistent with
the reason for such excess. Revolving Advances made after Administrative Agent has determined the existence of involuntary overadvances shall be deemed to be involuntary overadvances (and for the avoidance of doubt will represent Out-of-Formula
Loans) and shall be decreased in accordance with the preceding sentence. To the extent any Out-of-Formula Loans are not actually funded by the other Lenders as provided for in this Section 16.2(e), Administrative Agent may elect in its
discretion to fund such Out-of-Formula Loans and any such Out-of-Formula Loans so funded by Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be Revolving Advances made by and owing to Administrative Agent, and Administrative Agent shall be entitled to all
rights (including accrual of interest) and remedies of a Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents with respect to such Revolving Advances. 
(f) In addition to (and not in substitution of) the discretionary Revolving Advances permitted above in this Section 16.2, Administrative
Agent is hereby authorized by Borrowers and Lenders, at any time in Administrative Agents sole discretion, regardless of (i) the existence of a Default or an Event of Default, (ii) whether any of the other applicable conditions
precedent set forth in Section 8.2 hereof have not been satisfied or the commitments of Lenders to make Revolving Advances hereunder have been terminated for any reason, or (iii) any other contrary provision of this Agreement, to make
Revolving Advances (Protective Advances) to Borrowers on behalf of Lenders which Administrative Agent, in its reasonable business judgment, deems necessary or desirable (a) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any
portion thereof, (b) to enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Advances and other Obligations, or (c) to pay any other amount chargeable to Borrowers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; provided, that
the difference between (I) the aggregate Protective Advances made hereunder, minus (II) the aggregate Out-of-Formula Loans outstanding shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the Formula Amount and provided further that at any time
after giving effect to any such Protective Advances, the total of Revolving Advances outstanding hereunder, plus the then outstanding Swing Loans and the Maximum Undrawn Amount of Letters of Credit do not exceed the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount.
Lenders shall be obligated to fund such Protective Advances and effect a settlement with Administrative Agent therefor upon demand of Administrative Agent in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitment Percentages. To the extent any
Protective Advances are not actually funded by the other Lenders as provided for in this Section 16.2(f), any such Protective Advances funded by Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be Revolving Advances made by and owing to Administrative
Agent, and Administrative Agent shall be entitled to all rights (including accrual of interest) and remedies of a Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents with respect to such Revolving Advances. 
16.3. Successors and Assigns; Participations; New Lenders. 
(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Loan Parties, Administrative Agent, each Lender, all future holders of the
Obligations and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Loan Party may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent and each Lender. 
  130 


(b) Each Loan Party acknowledges that in the regular course of commercial banking business one or
more Lenders may at any time and from time to time sell participating interests in the Advances to other Persons (each such transferee or purchaser of a participating interest, a Participant). Each Participant may exercise all
rights of payment (including rights of set-off) with respect to the portion of such Advances held by it or other Obligations payable hereunder as fully as if such Participant were the direct holder thereof provided that (i) Loan Parties shall
not be required to pay to any Participant more than the amount which it would have been required to pay to Lender which granted an interest in its Advances or other Obligations payable hereunder to such Participant had such Lender retained such
interest in the Advances hereunder or other Obligations payable hereunder unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with Loan Partys prior written consent, and (ii) in no event shall Loan Parties be required to pay
any such amount arising from the same circumstances and with respect to the same Advances or other Obligations payable hereunder to both such Lender and such Participant. Each Loan Party hereby grants to any Participant a continuing security
interest in any deposits, moneys or other property actually or constructively held by such Participant as security for the Participants interest in the Advances. 
(c) Any Lender, with the consent of Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), may sell, assign or
transfer all or any part of its rights and obligations under or relating to Revolving Advances and/or Term Loans under this Agreement and the Other Documents to one or more additional Persons and one or more additional Persons may commit to make
Advances hereunder (each a Purchasing Lender), in minimum amounts of not less than Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00), pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement, executed by a Purchasing Lender, the transferor
Lender, and Administrative Agent and delivered to Administrative Agent for recording, provided, however, that each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations
under this Agreement with respect to each of the Revolving Advances and/or Term Loans under this Agreement in which such Lender has an interest. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the transfer effective date
determined pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (i) Purchasing Lender thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender thereunder with
a Revolving Commitment Percentage and/or Term Loan Commitment Percentage, as applicable, as set forth therein, and (ii) the transferor Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement, the Commitment Transfer Supplement creating a novation for that purpose. Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the
addition of such Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of the Revolving Commitment Percentages and/or Term Loan Commitment Percentages, as applicable, arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the rights and
obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents. Each Loan Party hereby consents to the addition of such Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of the Revolving Commitment Percentages and/or Term Loan
Commitment Percentages, as applicable, arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents. Loan Parties shall execute and
deliver such further documents and do such further acts and things in order to effectuate the foregoing provided, however, that the consent of 
  131 



Borrowers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or
(y) such assignment is to a Permitted Assignee; provided that Borrowers shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after
having received prior notice thereof.  (d) Any Lender, with the consent of Administrative Agent which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, may directly or indirectly sell, assign or transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under or relating to Revolving Advances and/or Term Loans under this Agreement and the Other Documents to an entity, whether a corporation,
partnership, trust, limited liability company or other entity that (i) is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and (ii) is
administered, serviced or managed by the assigning Lender or an Affiliate of such Lender (a Purchasing CLO and together with each Participant and Purchasing Lender, each a Transferee and collectively the
Transferees), pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement modified as appropriate to reflect the interest being assigned (Modified Commitment Transfer Supplement), executed by any intermediate purchaser, the
Purchasing CLO, the transferor Lender, and Administrative Agent as appropriate and delivered to Administrative Agent for recording. Upon such execution and delivery, from and after the transfer effective date determined pursuant to such Modified
Commitment Transfer Supplement, (i) Purchasing CLO thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Modified Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender thereunder and (ii) the
transferor Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Modified Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement, the Modified Commitment Transfer Supplement creating a novation for that purpose. Such
Modified Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing CLO. Each Loan Party hereby consents to the addition of such Purchasing CLO.
Borrowers shall execute and deliver such further documents and do such further acts and things in order to effectuate the foregoing.  (e)
Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address a copy of each Commitment Transfer Supplement and Modified Commitment Transfer Supplement delivered to it and a register (the Register) for the recordation of the names and
addresses of each Lender and the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and other fees due hereunder. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and each Loan Party, Administrative Agent and
Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Advance recorded therein for the purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrowing Agent or any Lender at any reasonable
time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Administrative Agent shall receive a fee in the amount of $3,500 payable by the applicable Purchasing Lender and/or Purchasing CLO upon the effective date of each transfer or assignment (other
than to an intermediate purchaser) to such Purchasing Lender and/or Purchasing CLO.  (f) Each Loan Party authorizes each Lender to disclose
to any Transferee and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Lenders possession concerning such Loan Party which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of such Loan Party pursuant to this Agreement or
in connection with such Lenders credit evaluation of such Loan Party. 
  132 


(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any Lender may at any
time and from time to time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;
provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
16.4. Application of Payments. 
Administrative Agent shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply or reverse and re-apply any payment and any and all proceeds of
Collateral to any portion of the Obligations. To the extent that any Loan Party makes a payment or Administrative Agent or any Lender receives any payment or proceeds of the Collateral for any Loan Partys benefit, which are subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver, custodian or any other party under any bankruptcy law, common law or equitable cause, then, to such extent, the
Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by Administrative Agent or such Lender. 
16.5. Indemnity.  Each

If any part of this Agreement is contrary to, prohibited by, or deemed invalid under Applicable Laws, such provision shall be inapplicable and
deemed omitted to the extent so contrary, prohibited or invalid, but the remainder hereof shall not be invalidated thereby and shall be given effect so far as possible.

16.10. Injunctive Relief. 
Each Loan Party recognizes that, in the event any Loan Party fails to perform, observe or discharge any of its obligations or liabilities under
this Agreement, or threatens to fail to perform, observe or discharge such obligations or liabilities, any remedy at law may prove to be inadequate relief to Lenders; therefor, Administrative Agent, if Administrative Agent so requests, shall be
entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving that actual damages are not an adequate remedy. 
16.11. Consequential Damages. 
Neither any Agent nor any Lender, nor any agent or attorney for any of them, shall be liable to any Borrower, or any Guarantor (or any
Affiliate of any such Person) for indirect, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages arising from any breach of contract, tort or other wrong relating to the establishment, administration or collection of the Obligations or as a result of any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or any Other Document.  16.12. Captions. 
The captions at various places in this Agreement are intended for convenience only and do not constitute and shall not be interpreted as part
of this Agreement.  16.13. Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. 
This Agreement may be executed in any number of and by different parties hereto on separate counterparts, all of which, when so executed, shall
be deemed an original, but all such counterparts shall constitute one and the same agreement. Any signature delivered by a party by facsimile or electronic transmission (including email transmission of a PDF image) shall be deemed to be an original
signature hereto.  16.14. Construction. 
The parties acknowledge that each party and its counsel have reviewed this Agreement and that the normal rule of construction to the effect
that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement or any amendments, schedules or exhibits thereto. 
16.15. Confidentiality; Sharing Information. 
Each Agent, each Lender and each Transferee shall hold all non-public information obtained by such Agent, such Lender or such Transferee
pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement in accordance with such Agents, such Lenders and such Transferees customary procedures for handling confidential information of this nature; provided, however, each Agent, each Lender
and each Transferee may disclose such confidential information (a) to its examiners, Affiliates, outside auditors, counsel and other professional advisors, (b) to any Agent, any Lender or to any prospective Transferees, and (c) as
required or requested by any Governmental Body or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process; provided, further that (i) unless specifically prohibited by Applicable Law, each Agent, each Lender and each Transferee shall 
  138 



use its reasonable best efforts prior to disclosure thereof, to notify the applicable Loan Party of the applicable request for disclosure of such non-public information (A) by a Governmental
Body or representative thereof (other than any such request in connection with an examination of the financial condition of a Lender or a Transferee by such Governmental Body) or (B) pursuant to legal process and (ii) in no event shall any
Agent, any Lender or any Transferee be obligated to return any materials furnished by any Loan Party other than those documents and instruments in possession of any Agent or any Lender in order to perfect its Lien on the Collateral once the
Obligations have been paid in full and this Agreement has been terminated. Each Loan Party acknowledges that from time to time financial advisory, investment banking and other services may be offered or provided to such Loan Party or one or more of
its Affiliates (in connection with this Agreement or otherwise) by any Lender or by one or more Subsidiaries or Affiliates of such Lender and each Loan Party hereby authorizes each Lender to share any information delivered to such Lender by such
Loan Party and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the decision of such Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any such Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Lender, it being understood that any such Subsidiary or Affiliate
of any Lender receiving such information shall be bound by the provisions of this Section 16.15 as if it were a Lender hereunder. Such authorization shall survive the repayment of the other Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any non-disclosure agreement or similar document executed by any Agent in favor of any Loan Party or any of any Loan Partys affiliates, the provisions of this Agreement shall supersede such agreements. 
16.16. Publicity.  Each
Loan Party and each Lender hereby authorizes each Agent to make appropriate announcements of the financial arrangement entered into among Borrowers, Agents and Lenders, including announcements which are commonly known as tombstones, in such
publications and to such selected parties as such Agent shall in its sole and absolute discretion deem appropriate; provided that other than with respect to tombstones or financial league tables, the content of any such announcement shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Borrowing Agent.  16.17. Certifications From Banks and Participants; USA PATRIOT Act. 
(a) Each Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender that is not incorporated under the Laws of the United States of America or a state
thereof (and is not excepted from the certification requirement contained in Section 313 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the applicable regulations because it is both (i) an affiliate of a depository institution or foreign bank that maintains a
physical presence in the United States or foreign country, and (ii) subject to supervision by a banking authority regulating such affiliated depository institution or foreign bank) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the certification,
or, if applicable, recertification, certifying that such Lender is not a shell and certifying to other matters as required by Section 313 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the applicable regulations: (1) within ten (10) days
after the Closing Date, and (2) as such other times as are required under the USA PATRIOT Act.  (b) The USA PATRIOT Act requires all
financial institutions to obtain, verify and record certain information that identifies individuals or business entities which open an account with such financial institution. Consequently, Lender may from time to time request, and each
Loan Party shall provide to Lender, such Loan Partys name, address, tax identification number and/or such other identifying information as shall be necessary for Lender to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act and any other Anti-Terrorism Law. 
  139 


16.18. Anti-Terrorism Laws. 
(a) Each Loan Party represents and warrants that (i) no Covered Entity is a Sanctioned Person and (ii) no Covered Entity, either in
its own right or through any third party, (A) has any of its assets in a Sanctioned Country or in the possession, custody or control of a Sanctioned Person in violation of any Anti-Terrorism Law; (B) does business in or with, or derives
any of its income from investments in or transactions with, any Sanctioned Country or Sanctioned Person in violation of any Anti-Terrorism Law; or (C) engages in any dealings or transactions prohibited by any Anti-Terrorism Law. 
(b) Each Loan Party covenants and agrees that (i) no Covered Entity will become a Sanctioned Person, (ii) no Covered Entity, either
in its own right or through any third party, will (A) have any of its assets in a Sanctioned Country or in the possession, custody or control of a Sanctioned Person in violation of any Anti-Terrorism Law; (B) do business in or with, or
derive any of its income from investments in or transactions with, any Sanctioned Country or Sanctioned Person in violation of any Anti-Terrorism Law; (C) engage in any dealings or transactions prohibited by any Anti-Terrorism Law or

Obligations will not be derived from any unlawful activity, (iv) each Covered Entity shall comply with all Anti-Terrorism Laws and (v) the Borrowers shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent in writing upon the occurrence of a

EXHIBIT 8.1(c) 
FORM OF  FINANCIAL
CONDITION CERTIFICATE  The undersigned, as the Chief Financial Officer of UNIVERSAL STAINLESS & ALLOY PRODUCTS, INC., a
Delaware corporation (Universal), hereby certifies that, in each case as of the Closing Date:  1) I am the Chief
Financial Officer of Universal. Each Loan Party (as defined in the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined)) is duly organized, existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. 
2) I am fully familiar with all of the business and financial affairs of the Loan Parties including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, all of the matters hereinafter described.  3) This Certificate is made and delivered to PNC Bank, National Association
(PNC), and various other financial institutions from time to time (PNC and such other financial institutions are each a Lender and collectively, the Lenders), PNC, as administrative agent for
the Lenders (PNC, in such capacity, the Administrative Agent) and PNC and Bank of America, N.A., as co-collateral agent for the Lenders (each in such capacity a Co-Collateral Agent and collectively the
Co-Collateral Agents, and together with Administrative Agent, each an Agent and collectively the Agents), pursuant to the terms of that Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement,
dated January 21, 2016, by and among Universal, Dunkirk Specialty Steel, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Dunkirk), and North Jackson Specialty Steel, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (North
Jackson, and Universal, Dunkirk and North Jackson are each a Borrower and collectively, the Borrowers), the Guarantors (as defined therein) from time to time party thereto, Lenders and Agents (as
amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement), for the purpose of inducing Lenders, now and from time to time hereafter, to continue to make Advances to Borrowers pursuant to the Credit
Agreement. I understand that you are relying on this Certificate. All capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement. 
4) I have reviewed the most recent financial projections of the Loan Parties delivered to the Administrative Agent in accordance with
Section 5.5(b) of the Credit Agreement (the Projections), and am fully familiar with the process pursuant to which they were generated. The Projections are based on underlying assumptions which provide a reasonable basis for
the Projections and which reflect Loan Parties judgment at the time prepared, based on present circumstances of the most likely set of conditions and course of action for the period projected, it being understood that such Projections are by
their nature prospective, subject to significant uncertainties and contingent on a wide range of factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Loan Parties, and that no assurance can be given that any of the projections will be realized and
actual results may vary significantly. 


5) After giving effect to the Credit Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, each
Loan Party will be solvent, able to pay its debts as they mature, will have capital sufficient to carry on its businesses and all businesses in which it is about to engage, and (i) as of the Closing Date, the fair present saleable value of its
assets, calculated on a going concern basis, is in excess of the amount of its liabilities and (ii) subsequent to the Closing Date, the fair saleable value of its assets (calculated on a going concern basis) will be in excess of the amount of
its liabilities. All material undisputed debts owing to third parties by any Loan Party are current and not past due.  6) The Credit
Agreement was and the Other Documents were and will be executed and delivered by Loan Parties to Administrative Agent and Lenders in good faith and in exchange for reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration. 
7) I have reviewed the relevant terms of the Credit Agreement and have made or caused to be made under our supervision a review of the
transactions and conditions of the Loan Parties from December 31, 2014 to the date of this Certificate and such review has not disclosed the existence during such period of any condition of event which constitutes or would constitute a Default
or Event of Default.  [INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]
