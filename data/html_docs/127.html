conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of the Dollar Equivalent of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of the Dollar Equivalent of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in <u>Sections

existing Committed Loans are to be converted, (5) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto, and (6) the currency of the Committed Loans to be borrowed. If the Borrower fails to specify a currency in a
Committed Loan Notice requesting a Committed Borrowing, then the Committed Loans so requested shall be made in Dollars. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Committed Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely
notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Committed Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Committed Loans; <u>provided</u>, <u>that</u>, in the case of a failure to timely request a continuation of Committed

such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month. No Committed Loan may be converted into or continued as a Committed Loan denominated in a different currency,
