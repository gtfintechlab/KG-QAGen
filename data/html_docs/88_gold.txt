and Letters of Credit; Revolving Loan Commitments.  (a)    Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, each Revolving Loan Lender severally agrees to (i) make loans on a revolving credit basis to the Borrower from time to time from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the day that is two (2) Business Days prior to the
Revolving Loan Commitment Expiration Date (each a Revolving Loan, and collectively, the Revolving Loans) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) participate in standby letters of credit
issued for the account of the Borrower or the other Loan Parties pursuant to Section 2.19 from time to time from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the day that is two (2) Business Days prior to the Revolving Loan Commitment

outstanding, (2) the aggregate Letter of Credit Amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding, (3) the aggregate amount of unreimbursed drawings under all Letters of Credit and (4) the aggregate principal amount of all Swing Line Loans

Credit if after giving effect to such Revolving Loan or such participation the sum of such Revolving Loan Lenders (w) Revolving Loans outstanding, (x) Commitment Percentage of the
aggregate Letter of Credit Amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding and (y) Commitment Percentage of the aggregate amount of unreimbursed drawings under all Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans outstanding, would exceed its Revolving Loan
Commitment or if the amount of such requested Revolving Loan, such Revolving Loan Lenders Commitment Percentage of such requested Letter of Credit or Swing Line Loans, is in excess of such Revolving Loan Lenders Available Revolving Loan
Commitment.  (b)    Except as otherwise provided herein, the Revolving Loans may from time to time be

(c)    Each Lender shall maintain in its internal records an account or accounts evidencing the
Indebtedness hereunder of the Borrower to such Lender, including the amounts of the Revolving Loans made by it and each repayment and prepayment in respect thereof. Any such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower, absent
manifest error; provided, failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect any Lenders Revolving Loan Commitment or the Borrowers Obligations in respect of any Revolving Loans; and
provided further, in the event of any inconsistency between the Register and any Lenders records, the recordations in the Register shall govern. If so requested by any Lender by written notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Agent), the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender a Revolving Note substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 (a Revolving Note) to evidence such Lenders Revolving
Loans.  (d)    The Borrower shall give the Agent irrevocable written notice, substantially in the form
of a Borrowing Notice (which notice must be received by the Agent prior to 10:00 a.m., Los Angeles time, on the Business Day that is the proposed borrowing date or, if all or any part of the Revolving Loans are requested to be made as LIBOR
Loans, at least three (3) Eurodollar Business Days prior to the proposed borrowing date) requesting that the Revolving Loan Lenders make Revolving Loans on the proposed borrowing date and specifying (i) the aggregate amount of
Revolving Loans requested to be made, (ii) subject to Sections 2.9 and 2.11, whether the Revolving Loans are to be LIBOR Loans, Base Rate Loans or a combination thereof and (iii) if the Revolving Loans are to be entirely or partly LIBOR
Loans, the respective amounts of each such Type of Revolving Loan and the respective lengths of the initial Interest Periods therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such notice may be given by telephone, provided it is promptly confirmed on
the same day in writing by delivery to the Agent of a written notice, substantially in the form of a Borrowing Notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Loan Lender thereof on the date of receipt of such
notice. On the proposed borrowing date, not later than 11:00 a.m., Los Angeles time, each Revolving Loan Lender shall make available to the Agent the amount of such Revolving Loan Lenders pro rata share of the aggregate borrowing amount (as
determined in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 2.1(a)) in immediately available funds by wiring such amount to such account as the Agent shall specify. The Agent may, in the absence of notification from any Revolving Loan Lender
that such Revolving Loan Lender has not made its pro rata share available to the Agent on such date, credit the account of the Borrower on the books of the Agent

(or credit such other account as the Borrower shall instruct the Agent in writing) with the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans. 
(e)    Neither the Agent nor any Revolving Loan Lender shall be responsible for the obligations or
Revolving Loan Commitment of any other Revolving Loan Lender hereunder, nor will the failure of any Revolving Loan Lender to comply with the terms of this Agreement relieve any other Revolving Loan Lender or the Borrower of its obligations under
this Agreement.  (f)    The Revolving Loan Commitment of each Revolving Loan Lender, and the Aggregate
Revolving Loan Commitment, shall terminate on the Revolving Loan Commitment Expiration Date. 
(g)    All outstanding Revolving Loans shall be due and payable on the Revolving Loan Commitment
Expiration Date.  2.2    [Reserved]. 
2.3    Optional Prepayments; Optional Commitment Reductions. The
Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, subject to Section 2.14, prepay the Loans in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon prior written notice by the Borrower to the Agent (i) in the case of prepayment of LIBOR
Loans, not later than 10:00 a.m., Los Angeles time, three (3) Business Days before the date of prepayment and (ii) in the case of prepayment of Base Rate Loans, not later than 10:00 a.m., Los Angeles time, one Business Day before the date
of prepayment, in each case specifying the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans, or a combination thereof and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each, and whether the
prepayment is of LIBOR Loans, Base Rate Loans or a combination thereof and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each. In addition, the Borrower may, at any time and from time to time reduce the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment in
whole or in part, upon prior written notice by the Borrower to the Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., Los Angeles time, three (3) Business Days before the date of such reduction. Upon receipt of any such notice from the Borrower, the Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender thereof. If any such notice of prepayment is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable by the Borrower on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to such date on the amount
prepaid. Any notice of prepayment of Loans and/or reduction or termination of Revolving Loan Commitments delivered by the Borrower under this Section may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, the
receipt of the proceeds, the issuance of other Indebtedness or the occurrence of any other transaction, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by delivery of further written notice to the Agent as soon as practicable on or prior
to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any prepayment of Loans, or reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment, shall be in the aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $5,000,000 in
excess thereof, or such other amounts acceptable to the Agent in its sole discretion. 
2.4    Mandatory Prepayment. If at any time the sum of (A) the
aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding, (B) the aggregate Letter of Credit Amount of all 
  - 30 - 



Table of Contents


Letters of Credit outstanding, (C) the aggregate amount of unreimbursed drawings under all Letters of Credit and (D) the aggregate principal amount of all Swing Line Loans outstanding,
exceeds the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment, then the Borrower shall immediately, without notice or request by the Agent, prepay the Revolving Loans and/or make a Cash Collateral Deposit with respect to Letters of Credit in an aggregate amount
equal to such excess.  2.5    Conversion and Continuation
Options.  (a)    The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert LIBOR Loans to Base Rate
Loans, by the Borrower giving the Agent at least one (1) Business Days prior irrevocable written notice of such election pursuant to a Continuation Notice, provided that any such conversion of LIBOR Loans may only be made on the
last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Subject to Sections 2.9 and 2.11 and so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and is then continuing, the Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans
by the Borrower giving the Agent at least three (3) Eurodollar Business Days prior irrevocable written notice of such election pursuant to a Continuation Notice. Any such notice of conversion to LIBOR Loans shall specify the length
of the initial Interest Period or Interest Periods therefor. All or any part of outstanding LIBOR Loans and, subject to Sections 2.9 and 2.11, Base Rate Loans, may be converted as provided herein, provided that (i) any such conversion
may only be made if, after giving effect thereto, Section 2.6 shall not have been contravened and (ii) no such Loan may be converted into a LIBOR Loan after the date that is one month prior to the Revolving Loan Commitment Expiration Date.
 (b)    Any LIBOR Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest
Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving notice to the Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term Interest Period set forth in Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be
applicable to such LIBOR Loan, provided that, unless the Agent otherwise consents in writing, no LIBOR Loan may be continued as such if, (i) after giving effect thereto, Section 2.6 would be contravened, (ii) after the date
that is one month prior to the Revolving Loan Commitment Expiration Date, or (iii) if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and provided, further, that if the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as
described above in this Section or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso, such Loans shall be automatically converted to LIBOR Loans having an Interest Period of one (1) month, on the last day of such
then-expiring Interest Period.  2.6    Minimum Amounts of
Tranches; Minimum Borrowings. All borrowings, conversions and continuations of LIBOR Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect
thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Loans comprising each Tranche shall be equal to $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or such other amounts acceptable to the Agent in its sole discretion and, in any case,
there shall not be more than eight Tranches. All borrowings of Base Rate Loans shall be in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, or such other amounts acceptable to the Agent in its sole discretion.

2.7    Interest
Rates and Payment Dates.  (a)    Each Loan shall (i) if a LIBOR Loan, bear interest for each
day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Adjusted Rate plus the Applicable Margin and (ii) if a Base Rate Loan, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
Applicable Margin.  (b)    If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, all amounts
outstanding hereunder shall, at the election of the Required Lenders, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate determined pursuant to Section 2.7(a) plus 2% per annum, from the date of the occurrence of such Event of Default
until such Event of Default is no longer continuing (after as well as before judgment). 
(c)    Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date; provided,
however, that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section shall be payable on demand. 
(d)    For purposes of determining the Applicable Margin, interest rates on the Loans and the unused
commitment fee shall be calculated on the basis of the Total Leverage Ratio set forth in the most recent Covenant Compliance Certificate received by the Agent. A Covenant Compliance Certificate may be delivered to the Agent by the Borrower no more
frequently than quarterly in accordance with Section 5.2(a). For accrued and unpaid interest and unused commitment fees only (no changes being made for interest payments or unused commitment fees previously made), changes in interest rates on
the Loans or unused commitment fees attributable to changes in the Applicable Margin caused by changes in the Total Leverage Ratio shall be calculated upon the delivery of a Covenant Compliance Certificate, and such change shall be effective with
respect to Base Rate Loans, LIBOR Loans and the unused commitment fee from the day which is three (3) Business Days after receipt by the Agent of such Covenant Compliance Certificate. If, for any reason, the Borrower shall fail to deliver a
Covenant Compliance Certificate when due in accordance with Section 5.2(a), and such failure shall continue for a period of ten (10) days, then the Leverage Level shall be deemed to be Leverage Level 5 retroactive to the date on which
the Borrower should have delivered such Covenant Compliance Certificate, and shall continue until a Covenant Compliance Certificate indicating a different Leverage Level is delivered to the Agent. 
(e)    Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, in the event that
any financial statement or certificate delivered pursuant to Sections 5.1 or 5.2(a) is shown to be inaccurate (regardless of whether this Agreement or the Commitments are in effect when such inaccuracy is discovered but only to the extent that such
inaccuracy is discovered prior to 180 days after the termination of this Agreement), and such inaccuracy, if corrected, would have led to the application of a higher Applicable Margin (the Correct Applicable Margin) for any period
that such financial statement or certificate, as applicable, covered, then (i) the Borrower shall immediately deliver to the Agent a corrected financial statement or certificate, as the case may be, for such period, (ii) the Applicable
Margin shall be reset to the Correct Applicable Margin for such period, and (iii) the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Agent the accrued additional interest owing as a result of such Correct Applicable Margin for such period.

2.8    Computation
of Interest and Fees. Interest on LIBOR Loans and the unused commitment fee shall be calculated on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty (360) days, for the actual days elapsed, and interest on Base Rate Loans and all other Obligations
shall be calculated on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty-five (365)/ three hundred sixty-six (366) days, for the actual days elapsed. Each determination of an interest rate by the Agent pursuant
to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Agent in the absence of manifest error. 
2.9    Inability to Determine Interest Rate. In the event that,
prior to the first day of any Interest Period, (a) the Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market,
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Adjusted Rate for such Interest Period or (b) the Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders acting that the LIBOR Adjusted Rate determined or to be
determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period, the Agent shall give telecopy
or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given, (i) any LIBOR Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall accrue interest at the Base Rate,
(ii) Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to LIBOR Loans shall be continued as Base Rate Loans and (iii) any outstanding LIBOR Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such Interest Period,
to Base Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Agent, no further LIBOR Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans. 
2.10    Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. Each payment (including
each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective Commitment Percentages then held by the Lenders. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower
hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff, deduction or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 11:00 a.m., Los Angeles time, on the due date thereof to the Agent, for the account of the
Lenders, at its office specified in Section 9.2, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Agent shall distribute such payments to the applicable Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. The Borrower authorizes the
Agent to debit any of its bank accounts with the Agent or to make a draw of Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans for the purpose of effecting payment of principal, interest or other costs and expenses payable by the Borrower to the Agent or any
Lender under this Agreement.  2.11    Illegality.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any Lender determines that any Requirement of Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful for such Lender to maintain LIBOR Loans as contemplated by
this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to continue LIBOR Loans as such and convert Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans shall forthwith be suspended during such period of illegality and (b) the Loans of such Lender then
outstanding as LIBOR Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such
conversion of a LIBOR Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then 
  - 33 - 



Table of Contents


current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.14. To the extent that a Lenders
LIBOR Loans have been converted to Base Rate Loans pursuant to this Section 2.11, all payments and prepayments of principal that otherwise would be applied to such Lenders LIBOR Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans. 
2.12    Increased Costs. 
(a)    Except with respect to Indemnified Taxes and Excluded Taxes, which shall be governed solely and
exclusively by Section 2.13, if any Change in Law shall:  (i)    impose, modify
or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement
reflected in the LIBOR Adjusted Rate);  (ii)    subject the Agent or any Lender to any
Taxes (other than Indemnified Taxes and Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 
(iii)    impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or
expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender;  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to
increase the cost to the Agent, increase the cost to Issuing Bank of issuing any Letter of Credit, or increase the cost to any such Lender of purchasing or maintaining any participation in a Letter of Credit or Swing Line Loan, or the Agent or such
Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the Agent or such Lender hereunder (whether of principal,
interest or any other amount) then, upon request of the Agent or such Lender, the Borrower will pay to the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be,
for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  (b)    If any Lender determines that any
Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders
capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans or Letters of Credit made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such
Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the
Borrower will pay to such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such

reduction suffered. The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the expiration of the Letters of Credit and the payment of all Obligations. 
(c)    A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender
or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within five (5) days after receipt thereof. 
2.13    Taxes. 
(a)    All payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes unless required by Requirements of Laws. If any Requirements of Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or
withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with Requirements of Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such
deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.13) the Lender, the Agent, or any other applicable recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding
been made.  (b)    Without duplication of Section 2.13(a), the Loan Parties shall timely pay to
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Requirements of Law, or at the option of the Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
(c)    The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Agent and each Lender within ten
(10) days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.13) payable or paid by the Agent or any
Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to the Agent or any Lender and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the
relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.  (d)    As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a
Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.13, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such
payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

(e)    Any Lender that is legally entitled to an
exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to any payments made under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or Agent, such
properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by Requirements of Laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any
Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Requirements of Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Agent to determine whether
or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such
documentation set forth in Sections 2.13(e)(A), 2.13(e)(B)(i)(iv) or 2.13(e)(C)) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed
cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, with respect to any Loan made to the Borrower: 
(A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent on or
prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9
certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding Tax, 
(B)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to
the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the
Borrower or the Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:  (i)    in the case
of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to
the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income
article of such tax treaty;  (ii)    executed originals or IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor form);

Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or any successor forms); 
(iv)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example, where

exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate on behalf of each such direct or indirect partner), or 
(v)    executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable requirements of Law
as a basis for claiming exemption from, or a reduction in, U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable requirements of Law to permit the Borrower and the Agent to

or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by
Requirements of Laws (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to comply with their

Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to deliver to the Loan Parties and
to any successor Agent any documentation provided by such Lender to the Agent pursuant to this Section 2.13(e).  Each
Lender shall, whenever any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, deliver promptly to the Borrower and the Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new
documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent) or promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of its legal ineligibility to do so. 
(f)    If the Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole good faith discretion, that it has received a
refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.13, it shall promptly pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the
extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Loan Parties under this Section 2.13 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of the Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with
respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed
by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Agent or such Lender in the event the Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will
the Agent or a Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place the Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the
Agent or such Lender would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had
never been paid. This Section shall not be construed to require the Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
(g)    Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for
(i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes
attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.6(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or
paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such
Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this paragraph (g).

(h)    For purposes of this Section 2.13, the term
Lender includes the Issuing Bank, the term Loan includes liabilities with respect to Letters of Credit, and the term applicable Requirements of Law includes FATCA. 
(i)     Each partys obligations under this Section 2.13 shall survive the resignation or
replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations. 
2.14    Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender
and to hold each Lender harmless from and to pay each Lender on demand the amount of any liability, loss or expense arising from the reemployment of funds obtained by it or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were
obtained (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in payment when due of the principal amount of or interest on any LIBOR Loan, (b) default
by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of LIBOR Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (c) default by the Borrower in making any
prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (d) the making by the Borrower of a prepayment or conversion of LIBOR Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period
with respect thereto (including any prepayment required as a result of acceleration of the Loans under Article 7). Such Lenders certificate as to such liability, loss or expense shall be deemed conclusive, absent manifest error. This covenant
shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the expiration of the Letters of Credit, the expiration of the Commitments and the payment of all Obligations under the Loan Documents. 
2.15    Mitigation of Costs. If any Lender, by taking any
reasonable action, so long as making such change or taking such other action is not disadvantageous to it in any financial, regulatory or other respect, can mitigate any adverse effect on the Borrower under Section 2.12 or 2.13, such Lender
shall take such action.  2.16    Unused Commitment Fee. The
Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of the Revolving Loan Lenders, an unused commitment fee for the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment Expiration Date, based on the aggregate
amount, for each day during such period, of the Available Revolving Loan Commitments (without taking into account outstanding Swing Line Loans, except to the extent any Revolving Loan Lender is deemed to or has purchased a participation in such
outstanding Swing Line Loans), and computed at the per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin for such unused commitment fee. Such unused commitment fee shall be payable in installments quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March,
June, September and December and on the Revolving Loan Commitment Expiration Date, commencing on March 
31, 2019.  2.17    Substitution and Removal of Lenders. If any
Lender (i) makes a claim under Section 2.12 or 2.13, (ii) becomes unable to make or maintain LIBOR Loans pursuant to Section 2.9 or 2.11, (iii) is a Defaulting Lender or (iv) is a
Non-Approving Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Agent, remove such Lender on a non-pro rata basis by
(x) requiring such Lender to assign and delegate, without

recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 9.6), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments
pursuant to Section 2.12 or Section 2.13) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to a Lender reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and Agent that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be a new
Lender or an existing Lender, if an existing Lender accepts such assignment) or (y) reducing the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment by an amount equal to such Lenders Revolving Loan Commitment; provided that: 
(a)    the Borrower shall have paid to the Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 9.6(c); 
(b)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its
Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case
of all other amounts); and  (c)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable law. 
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  
2.18    Defaulting Lenders.  (a)    Defaulting Lender
Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law: 
(i)    Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or
disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and Section 9.1. 
(ii)    Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or
other amounts received by the Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article 7 or otherwise) or received by the Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.7 shall
be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing
by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with this Agreement; fourth, as
the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent;
fifth, if so determined by the Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this
Agreement and (y) Cash

Collateralize the Issuing Banks future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with this
Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender
against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a
result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting
Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate
share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and
Swing Line Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments without giving effect to clause (iv) below. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay
amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
(iii)    Commitment and Letter of Credit Fees. No Defaulting Lender shall be
entitled to receive any unused commitment fee or any letter of credit fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been
paid to that Defaulting Lender).  (iv)    Reallocation of Participations to Reduce
Fronting Exposure. All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders participation in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their
respective Commitment Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause such Lenders Commitment Percentage of the sum of the outstanding Revolving
Loans, the aggregate Letter of Credit Amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding, the aggregate amount of unreimbursed drawings under all Letters of Credit and (4) the aggregate principal amount of all Swing Line Loans outstanding to exceed
such Non-Defaulting Lenders Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having
become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such
reallocation.  (v)    Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Line Loans. If the
reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the 
  - 41 - 



Table of Contents


Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lenders
Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.23. 
(b)    Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Agent, the Swing Line Lender and the Issuing
Bank agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include
arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the
Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments (without giving effect to paragraph (a)(iv) above), whereupon, such Lender will cease
to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further,
that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a
Defaulting Lender.  (c)    New Swing Line Loans/Letters of Credit. So long as any Lender is a
Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swing Line Lender shall not be required to fund any Swing Line Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swing Line Loan and (ii) the Issuing Bank shall not
be required to issue, extend, increase, reinstate or renew any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto. 
2.19    Issuance of Letters of Credit. 
(a)    Subject to the limitations on Letters of Credit set forth in Section 2.1(a), the Borrower
shall be entitled to request the issuance of standby Letters of Credit in Dollars from time to time from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date three (3) Business Days prior to the Revolving Loan Commitment Expiration Date, by
giving the Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Agent) a Letter of Credit Request at least three (3) Business Days before the requested date of issuance of such Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day). Any Letter of Credit Request received
by the Issuing Bank and the Agent later than 12:00 noon, Los Angeles time, shall be deemed to have been received on the next Business Day. Each Letter of Credit Request shall be signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower and any other Loan
Party that is to be the account party thereof, shall be irrevocable and shall be effective upon receipt by the Issuing Bank and the Agent. Provided that a valid Letter of Credit Request has been received by the Issuing Bank and the Agent and upon
fulfillment of the other applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.2, the Issuing Bank will issue the requested Letter of Credit and will provide a copy thereof to the Agent. Each Letter of Credit shall have (i) drawing language
acceptable to the Agent and (ii) an expiration date as set forth in the Letter of Credit Request; provided that no Letter of Credit shall in any event have an expiration date later than the earlier of (A) one year after the issuance
thereof (or such longer period as the Agent and the Issuing

Bank shall agree in their sole discretion) and (B) two Business Days prior to the Revolving Loan Commitment Expiration Date. 
(b)    Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have
sold and transferred to each Revolving Loan Lender, and each Revolving Loan Lender shall be deemed to have purchased and received from the Issuing Bank, in each case irrevocably and without any further action by any party, an undivided interest and
participation in such Letter of Credit, each drawing thereunder and the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement in respect thereof in an amount equal to the product of (i) such Revolving Loan Lenders Commitment Percentage and
(ii) the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (assuming compliance with all conditions to drawing). 
(c)    The payment by the Issuing Bank of a draft drawn under any Letter of Credit shall constitute for
all purposes of this Agreement the making by the Issuing Bank as a Revolving Loan Lender hereunder (in such capacity, the Drawing Lender) of a Base Rate Loan in the amount of such payment (but without any requirement of compliance
with the conditions set forth in Sections 2.6 or 4.2). In the event that any such Loan by the Drawing Lender resulting from a drawing under any Letter of Credit is not repaid by the Borrower by 11:00 a.m., Los Angeles time, on the day
of payment of such drawing, the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Agent, and the Agent shall notify each other Revolving Loan Lender. Each Revolving Loan Lender shall, on the day of such notification (or if such notification is not given by
12:00 noon, Los Angeles time, on such day, then on the next succeeding Business Day), make a Base Rate Loan, which shall be used to repay the applicable portion of the Base Rate Loan of the Drawing Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit
drawing, in an amount equal to the amount of such Revolving Loan Lenders participation in such drawing (but without any requirement of compliance with the conditions set forth in Sections 2.6 or 4.2) and shall deliver to the Agent for the
account of the Drawing Lender, on the day of such notification (or if such notification is not given by 12:00 noon, Los Angeles time, on such day, then on the next succeeding Business Day) and in immediately available funds, the amount of such
Base Rate Loan. In the event that any Revolving Loan Lender fails to make available to the Agent for the account of the Drawing Lender the amount of such Base Rate Loan, the Drawing Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such
Revolving Loan Lender, together with interest thereon for each day from the date of non-payment until such amount is paid in full at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. 
(d)    The obligations of the Borrower with respect to any Letter of Credit, any Letter of Credit Request
and any other agreement or instrument relating to any Letter of Credit and any Base Rate Loan made under Section 2.19(c) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the
aforementioned documents under all circumstances, including the following: 
(i)    any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit prior to its stated
expiration date of any Letter of Credit, this Agreement or any other Loan Document; 
(ii)    the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower may
have at any time against any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of

Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or transferee may be acting) or the Agent, the Issuing Bank, any Revolving Loan Lender (other than the defense of payment to a Revolving Loan
Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any unrelated transaction; 
(iii)    any statement or other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to
be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect, or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever; provided that payment by the Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit against presentation of such
draft or document shall not have constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction; and 
(iv)    any exchange, release or non-perfection
of any collateral, or any release, amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from the Guarantee Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
(e)    The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, with respect to each Letter of Credit issued hereunder, the
following fees:  (i)    with respect to each Letter of Credit, for the account of the
Revolving Loan Lenders, for the period from and including the day such Letter of Credit is issued to but excluding the day such Letter of Credit expires, a Letter of Credit fee equal to the product of (x) the Applicable Margin then applicable
to LIBOR Loans and (y) the Letter of Credit Amount of such Letter of Credit from time to time, such Letter of Credit fee to be payable in installments quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and
on the expiration date of such Letter of Credit;  (ii)    with respect to each Letter
of Credit issued hereunder, for the account of the Issuing Bank (so long as the Issuing Bank is not also the sole Lender under this Agreement), a fronting fee equal to 0.15% per annum of the Letter of Credit Amount of such Letter of Credit,
payable upon issuance of such Letter of Credit; and  (iii)    with respect to each
Letter of Credit issued hereunder, for the account of the Issuing Bank, from time to time such additional fees and charges in accordance with the Issuing Banks standard internal charge guidelines (as such guidelines may change from time to
time) and the related Letter of Credit Request.  (f)    The Borrower agrees to the provisions in the
Letter of Credit Request forms; provided, however, that the terms of the Loan Documents shall take precedence if there is any inconsistency between the terms of the Loan Documents and the terms of the applicable form. 
(g)    The Borrower assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any
Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. None of the Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, nor any of their respective officers or directors shall be 
  - 44 - 



Table of Contents


liable or responsible for (i) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; or (ii) the validity,
sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereof, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing
Bank may accept any document that appears on its face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary. 
(h)    At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, subject to Section 2.18, within one
Business Day following demand by the Issuing Bank the Borrower shall make a Cash Collateral Deposit with the Agent in an amount equal to the Fronting Exposure (less the amount of any Cash Collateral Deposit made by such Defaulting Lender and held by
the Agent) with respect to such Defaulting Lender. The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grant to the Agent, and agree to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash
Collateral Deposits as security for the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of Letters of Credit. 
2.20    [Reserved]. 
2.21    Swing Line Loans. 
(a)    Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender agrees to make loans on a
revolving credit basis to the Borrower from time to time from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment Expiration Date (each a Swing Line Loan, and collectively, the Swing Line
Loans) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, after giving effect to the making of any Swing Line Loan, in no event shall (i) the then existing aggregate outstanding principal amount of Swing Line Loans
exceed $5,000,000 (Swing Line Sublimit) at any time or (ii) the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding (other than Revolving Loans made for the purpose of repaying any Refunded Swing
Line Loans or reimbursing the Issuing Bank for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, but not yet so applied), (B) the aggregate principal amount of all Swing Line Loans outstanding, (C) the aggregate Letter of Credit Amount of all
Letters of Credit outstanding, and (D) the aggregate amount of unreimbursed drawings under all Letters of Credit, exceed the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment at any time. Amounts borrowed pursuant to this Section 2.21 may be repaid and
reborrowed during the period commencing on the Closing Date to but excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment Expiration Date. 
(b)    All Swing Line Loans shall be Base Rate Loans. The Swing Line Lenders obligation to make
Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall expire on the Revolving Loan Commitment Expiration Date and all Swing Line Loans and all other amounts owed hereunder with respect to the Swing Line Loans shall be paid in full no later than
such date. Swing Line Loans shall be made in an aggregate minimum amount of $100,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount, or such other amounts acceptable to the Swing Line Lender in its sole discretion. 
(c)    The Swing Line Lender shall maintain in its internal records an account or accounts evidencing the
Indebtedness hereunder of the Borrower to the Swing Line Lender, 
  - 45 - 



Table of Contents


including the amounts of the Swing Line Loans made by it and each repayment and prepayment in respect thereof. Any such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower, absent
manifest error; provided, failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect the Borrowers Obligations in respect of any Swing Line Loans; provided further, in the event of any
inconsistency between the Register and the Swing Line Lenders records, the recordations in the Register shall govern. If so requested by the Swing Line Lender by written notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall
execute and deliver to such Lender a Swing Line Note substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 attached hereto (a Swing Line Note) to evidence the Swing Line Lenders Swing Line
Loans.  (d)    Whenever the Borrower desires that the Swing Line Lender make a Swing Line Loan, the
Borrower shall give the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Agent) irrevocable written notice, substantially in the form of a Borrowing Notice (which notice must be received by the Agent prior to 12:00 noon, Los Angeles time, on the Business Day
that is the proposed borrowing date).  (e)    The Swing Line Lender shall make the amount of its Swing
Line Loan available to the Agent not later than 2:00 p.m., Los Angeles time, on the Business Day that is the proposed borrowing date by wire transfer of same day funds in Dollars by wiring such amount to such account as the Agent shall specify.
Except as provided herein, upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent specified herein, the Agent shall make the proceeds of such Swing Line Loans available to the Borrower on the proposed borrowing date by causing an amount of same day
funds in Dollars equal to the proceeds of all such Swing Line Loans received by the Agent from the Swing Line Lender to be credited to the account of the Borrower with the Agent, or to such other account as may be designated in writing to the Agent
by the Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Swing Line Lender may, but shall not be obligated to, make Swing Line Loans at any time that one or more of the Lenders is a Defaulting Lender. 
(f)    With respect to any Swing Line Loans which have not been voluntarily prepaid by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.3, the Swing Line Lender may at any time in its sole and absolute discretion (but at least on a weekly basis), deliver to the Agent (with a copy to the Borrower), no later than 11:00 a.m., Los Angeles time at least one
Business Day in advance of the proposed borrowing date, a notice (which shall be deemed to be a Borrowing Notice given by the Borrower) requesting that each Revolving Loan Lender make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans to the Borrower on such
proposed borrowing date in an amount equal to the amount of such Swing Line Loans (the Refunded Swing Line Loans) outstanding on the date such notice is given which the Swing Line Lender requests the Lenders to prepay. Anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the proceeds of such Revolving Loans made by the Revolving Loan Lenders other than the Swing Line Lender shall be immediately delivered by the Agent to the Swing Line Lender (and
not to the Borrower) and applied to repay a corresponding portion of the Refunded Swing Line Loans and (ii) on the day such Revolving Loans are made, the Swing Line Lenders pro rata share of the Refunded Swing Line Loans shall be deemed
to be paid with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan made by the Swing Line Lender to the Borrower, and such portion of the Swing Line Loans deemed to be so paid shall no longer be outstanding as Swing Line Loans but shall instead constitute part of the
Swing Line Lenders outstanding Revolving Loans to the Borrower. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Agent and the Swing Line Lender to charge the Borrowers accounts with the

Agent and the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be (up to the amount available in each such account) in order to immediately pay the Swing Line Lender the amount of the Refunded Swing Line Loans
to the extent the proceeds of such Revolving Loans made by the Revolving Loan Lenders, including the Revolving Loans deemed to be made by the Swing Line Lender, are not sufficient to repay in full the Refunded Swing Line Loans. If any portion of any

eliminate the Swing Line Lenders risk with respect to the Defaulting Lenders participation in such Swing Line Loan, including by depositing with the Agent immediately available funds

2.22    Incremental Commitment. 
(a)    The Borrower may, by written notice to the Agent (each, a Commitment Increase
Notice), at any time prior to the Revolving Loan Commitment Expiration Date, request increases of the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment (a Revolving Commitment Increase); provided that (i) the
Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment after giving effect to the Revolving Commitment Increase shall not exceed $150,000,000 (the Maximum Commitment Amount); (ii) the Borrower may exercise such increase request option up to three
times during the term of this Agreement; (iii) each exercise of the increase request option shall be in a minimum principal amount of not less than $10,000,000; provided that the exercise of such increase request option may be less than
$10,000,000 if the unused portion of the Maximum Commitment Amount is less than $10,000,000, so long as the request is for the full amount of the remaining Maximum Commitment Amount, and (iv) after giving effect to such Revolving Commitment
Increase, calculated on a pro forma basis, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would be caused by the consummation of such Revolving Commitment Increase. 
(b)    Each such Commitment Increase Notice shall specify (A) the date on which the Borrower proposes
that the new Revolving Commitment Increase shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than 15 Business Days after the date the Agent receives such notice and (B) the requested amount of such increase. Notwithstanding any term of this
Agreement to the contrary, neither the Agent nor any Lender shall be deemed to have committed to any Revolving Commitment Increase unless such Lender executes and delivers an Increased Commitment Letter (as defined below); for the avoidance of
doubt, any Lender may accept or decline to provide a Revolving Commitment Increase in its sole discretion.

Lender, and each Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in such increase in an amount equal to its pro rata share of outstanding Revolving Loans immediately prior to the effectiveness of any such increase. Any Lender
electing to participate in such increase must forward its written commitment therefor (an Increased Commitment Letter) to the Agent within 10 Business Days of delivery to such Lender of such Commitment Increase Notice. The failure
of a Lender to deliver an Increased Commitment Letter to the Agent within such time period shall be deemed a rejection by such Lender of the option to participate in such Revolving Commitment Increase. In the event that the Revolving Commitment
Increase requested by the Borrower is not fully committed to by existing Lenders as contemplated above, the Borrower may designate one or more Persons as new Lender(s), each of whom must be reasonably acceptable to the Agent (each, a New
Lender); provided that in no event shall such New Lender be any Person set forth in Section 9.6(b)(v), or may designate one or more existing Lenders that is willing to increase its commitment by more than its pro rata share, to
provide the amount of such unallocated excess Revolving Commitment Increase. Each New Lender shall become a Lender pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent (a New Lender Joinder). Subject to
the foregoing, final allocations with respect to any Revolving Commitment Increase shall be determined solely by the Borrower

terms and conditions relating to such Revolving Commitment Increase (including as to any upfront fee); provided that any Revolving Commitment Increase shall be on terms consistent with the initial Revolving Loan Commitments. Each Incremental
Facility Supplement may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary, in the opinion of the Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.22. From and
after the effectiveness of any Revolving Commitment Increase, the Loans and Commitments established pursuant to this Section 2.22 shall constitute Loans and Commitments under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by, this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from the Guarantee Agreement.

irrevocably designates and appoints MUB, as Agent for such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes MUB, as the Agent for such Lender, to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Agent, by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any
Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Agent in such capacity. The provisions of this Section are
solely for the benefit of the Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.

Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact, Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or
omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except for its or such Persons own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by the final
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Borrower, any
other Loan Party, or any other party to the Loan Documents, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the
Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of the Borrower, any
other Loan Party, or any other party to the Loan Documents to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Borrower, any other Loan Party, or any other party to the Loan Documents. 
8.4    Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice (including any telephonic notice), consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document
or conversation reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Borrower), the
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note or the holder of any Loan, as set forth in the Register, as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment,
negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or
concurrence of the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as it deems appropriate, or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense (except those incurred solely as a result of the Agents
gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by the final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as may be required, and such
request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans. 
8.5    Notice of Default. Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall
be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default hereunder unless such Person has received notice from the Agent, a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such notice is a
notice of default. In the event that the Agent or any Lender receives such a notice, the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall give notice 
  - 75 - 



Table of Contents


thereof to the Agent and the Lenders. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders or all Lenders as appropriate;
provided that unless and until the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the
best interests of the Lenders or as the Agent shall believe necessary to protect the Agent and the Lenders interests. 
8.6    Non-Reliance on Agent
and Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that none of the Agent or any of its respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact,
Subsidiaries or Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower, any other Loan Party, or any other party to the Loan Documents, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it
has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, and any other party to the Loan Documents and
made its own decision to make its Loans, participate in Letters of Credit hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation
as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, and any other party to the Loan Documents. The Agent agrees to promptly
furnish to each Lender a copy of all notices, reports and other documents received by it from the Borrower pursuant to the terms hereof; provided that the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit
or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower, any other Loan Party, or any other party to the Loan Documents which may otherwise come into the
possession of the Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact, Subsidiaries or Affiliates except such as may come into the possession
of the employees of Agent then having the responsibility for the administration of this Agreement.  
8.7    Indemnification. The Lenders hereby indemnify the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Lender in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of
the Borrower to do so), ratably according to the respective amounts of their Commitment Percentages, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs (including, without limitation,
the allocated cost of internal counsel), expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Obligations) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Lender in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent, the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender

shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the extent resulting
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender, as determined by the final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The agreements
in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the Commitments and the expiration of the Letters of Credit and the payment of all Obligations. 
8.8    Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The Agent and its
Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, the other Loan Parties and any other party to the Loan Documents as though the Agent were not the Agent hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents. With respect to the Agent, the Loans made by the Agent, the Letters of Credit participated in by the Agent and any Notes issued to the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as
any Lender and the Agent may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent and the terms Lender and Lenders shall include the Agent in its individual capacity. 
8.9    Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent upon thirty
(30) days notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. If the Agent shall resign as Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint (with the approval of the Borrower, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and not to be required if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing) from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, whereupon such successor agent
shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Agent and the term Agent shall mean such successor agent, effective upon its appointment, and the former Agents rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without
any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of any of the Obligations. Notice of such appointment shall be given by such successor agent to the Borrower, the Issuing Bank
and each Lender. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on such thirtieth (30th) day. After any
retiring Agents resignation as Agent, the provisions of this Section shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

(b)    The Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall indemnify the Agent, each Lender and each Related Party of
any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (limited, in the case of legal

Hazardous Substances migrating from such properties, and any violation of, noncompliance with or liability under any Environmental Laws applicable to the operations of the Loan Parties; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any

Lender, the termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations. 
9.6    Successors and Assigns; Participations. 
(a)    Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Borrower and no other Loan Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the Agent and each Lender, and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.6(b), (ii) by way of

to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
(b)    Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided, each such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(i)    Minimum Amounts. 
(A)    in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning
Lenders Commitment and/or the Loans at the time owing to it, or assignments to related Approved Funds that equal at least the amount specified in Section 9.6(b)(i)(B) of this Section in the aggregate or in the case of an assignment to a
Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and

delivered to the Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Acceptance, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless each of the Agent and, so long
as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 
(ii)    Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of
its rights and obligations among separate facilities on a non-pro rata basis. 
(iii)    Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent
required by Section 9.6(b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:  (A)    the
consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (I) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment, or (II) such assignment is to a Lender, an
Affiliate of a Lender, or an Approved Fund; provided, the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Agent within ten Business Days after having received notice
thereof;  (B)    the consent of the Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender; and

(vii)    Certain Additional Payments. In
connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall
make such additional payments to the Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions,
including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably
consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and
fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder
shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this Section, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Agent pursuant to Section 9.6(c) of this Section, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the
assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, and 9.5 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring
prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder
arising from such Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section but otherwise complies with Section 9.6(d) shall be
treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 9.6(d). 
(c)    Register. The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall
maintain at its offices, a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing
to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name
is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Loans (including any Notes evidencing such Loans) are registered obligations, and the right, title and interest of the Lender and their assignees in
and to such Loans shall be transferable only upon 
  - 84 -

notation of such transfer in the Register and no assignment thereof such be effective until recorded therein. This Section 9.6(c) shall be construed so that the Loans are at all times
maintained in registered form within the meanings of Section 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code. 
(d)    Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the
Borrower or the Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, any Borrower, any Affiliate of any Borrower or Subsidiary of any Borrower) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights
and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided, (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Borrower, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 9.6(b) with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s). Any agreement
or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided, such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in Section 9.1(b) or 9.1(c) that affects such Participant. The
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section; provided,
such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.15 and 2.16 as if it were an assignee under Section 9.6(b). To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.8 as
though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation pursuant to this Section shall maintain a register on which it records the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
Participants participation interest with respect to the Loans and the Commitments (each, a Participant Register). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of a participation with respect to such Loans or Commitments for all purposes under this Agreement, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. In maintaining the
Participant Register, such Lender shall be acting as the agent of the Borrower solely for purposes of applicable U.S. federal income tax law and undertakes no duty, responsibility or obligation to the Borrower (without limitation, in no event shall
such Lender be a fiduciary of the Borrower for any purpose, except that such Lender shall maintain the Participant Register); provided, no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any
Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans, or its other obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to
establish in connection with a Tax audit that such Commitment, Loan, or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations or, if different, under
Sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

Table of Contents

(e)    Limitations upon Participant Rights. A
Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.12 or 2.13 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant (except to the extent such
entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation) unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written
consent. A Participant that would be a Non-US Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.13 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant
and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. 
(f)    Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any
of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  
9.7    Adjustments; Set-Off. (a) If any Lender (a benefitted Lender) shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or its
participations in Letters of Credit, or interest thereon, or fees, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the
nature referred to in Section 7.1(g) or 8.8, or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lenders Loans, its participation in Letters of
Credit, or interest thereon, or fees, such benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders such portion of each such other Lenders Loans or fees, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or
the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess
payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Borrower agrees that each Lender so
purchasing a portion of another Lenders Loans or its participation in Letters of Credit may exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such portion
as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion.  (b)    In addition to any rights
and remedies of the Agent provided by law, the Agent shall have the right, exercisable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the
Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, to set-off and appropriate and apply against any such Obligations any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any
currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by the Agent or any branch or agency thereof or bank
controlling the Agent to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower. The Agent agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application made by the Agent, provided that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
