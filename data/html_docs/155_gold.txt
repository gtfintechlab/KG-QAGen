agrees to make the $58,500,000 Initial Term Loan to the Borrower on the Effective Date, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
amount of such Initial Term Loan Lender’s Initial Term Loan Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the
representations and warranties herein set forth, each Delayed Draw Term Loan Lender severally agrees to make Delayed Draw Term Loans
to the Borrower at any time and from time to time after the Effective Date until the Delayed Draw Term Loan Expiration Date. The principal
amount of any Delayed Draw Term Loan to be made by any Delayed Draw Term Loan Lender shall not exceed such Delayed Draw Term Loan Lender’s
remaining unfunded Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment; provided that no Delayed Draw Term Loans shall be made, if, after giving
effect to any such Delayed Draw Term Loans, the aggregate amount of Loans outstanding at any time shall exceed the then Borrowing Base.
The Borrower and the other Loan Parties acknowledge and agree that the Initial Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loans shall be funded
at a discount to their face value; i.e. “original issue discount”, which is payable to the Term Loan Lenders and, as such,
the “original issue discount” shall not advanced to Borrowers on the date hereof; provided, however, that such
 “original issue discount” constitutes a portion of the outstanding indebtedness evidenced by this Agreement held by the Term
Loan Lenders for all other purposes under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including determination of interest, the Prepayment
Premium and amount due on the Final Maturity Date), the Term Loan Lenders shall be deemed to have provided a Term Loan in the full amount
of the Commitments.
 


59 
 

 
(b)            Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Term Loan made on the Effective Date shall not exceed the aggregate
$58,500,000 Initial Term Loan Commitments of all Lenders, (ii) the aggregate principal amount of all Delayed Draw Term Loans shall
not exceed the aggregate $10,000,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitments of all Lenders and (iii) the aggregate amount of Loans outstanding
at any time shall not exceed the then Borrowing Base. Any principal amount of any Term Loan which is repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed;
provided, however, that if, prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Date, any portion of the Initial Term
Loan that exceeds the then Borrowing Base is required to be repaid by the Loan Parties pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(vii), such
amount may subsequently be reborrowed so long as the Loan Parties shall be in compliance with the Borrowing Base then in effect after
giving effect to such reborrowing (the “Reborrowed Amount”); provide further however, (x) the aggregate
amount of all such reborrowings shall not exceed $5,000,000, (y) any such reborrowings with respect to any repayment must be made
not later than the date that is ninety (90) days after such repayment was required to be made pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(vii) and
(z) the Loan Parties shall comply with Section 5.03 with respect to any such reborrowings. Borrowings of the Reborrowed
Amount shall be deemed to be an Initial Term Loan hereunder and for all purposes under the Loan Documents.
 
Section 2.02             Making
the Term Loans.
 
(a)            The
Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent prior written notice (in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto (a “Notice
of Borrowing”)), not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the date which is three (3) Business Days (or, in the
case of any Delayed Draw Term Loan or Reborrowed Amount, ten (10) Business Day) prior to the date of the proposed Term Loan (or
such shorter period as the Administrative Agent is willing to accommodate from time to time, but in no event later than 12:00 p.m. (New
York City time) on the borrowing date of the proposed Term Loan). Such Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the
principal amount of the proposed Term Loan, (ii) whether the Term Loan is requested to be a Reference Rate Loan or a LIBOR Rate
Loan, (iii) the proposed borrowing date, which must be a Business Day, and, with respect to the Initial Term Loan, must be the Effective
Date and (iv) the wiring information of the account of the Borrower to which the proceeds of such Loan are to be disbursed. The
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may act without liability upon the basis of written, telecopied or telephonic notice believed by
the Administrative Agent in good faith to be from the Borrower (or from any Authorized Officer thereof designated in writing purportedly
from the Borrower to the Administrative Agent). The Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be entitled to rely conclusively on any
Authorized Officer’s authority to request a Term Loan on behalf of the Borrower until the Administrative Agent receives written
notice to the contrary. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have no duty to verify the authenticity of the signature appearing
on any written Notice of Borrowing. Any Delayed Draw Term Loan shall be in an aggregate amount of at least $2,500,000 (except such minimum
amount shall not apply when the Borrower draws all of the remaining Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitments available at such time) and there
shall not be more than (x) four (4) borrowings of Delayed Draw Term Loans and (y) two (2) borrowings of the Reborrowed
Amount.
 


60 
 

 
(b)            Each
Notice of Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.02 shall be irrevocable and the Borrower shall be bound to make a borrowing
in accordance therewith.
 
(c)            Pro
Rata Shares:
 
(i)              Except
as otherwise provided in this subsection 2.02(c), all Loans under this Agreement shall be made by the Lenders simultaneously
and proportionately to their Pro Rata Shares of the total Initial Term Loan Commitment, it being understood that no Lender shall be responsible
for any default by any other Lender in that other Lender’s obligations to make a Term Loan requested hereunder, nor shall the Commitment
of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of the default by any other Lender in that other Lender’s obligation to make
a Term Loan requested hereunder, and each Lender shall be obligated to make the Term Loans required to be made by it by the terms of
this Agreement regardless of the failure by any other Lender.
 
(ii)             Following
the receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall notify each applicable Lender of the specifics of the Term Loan.
Each applicable Lender shall make its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Loan available to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available
funds, to the Administrative Agent’s account no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date of the proposed Term Loan.
Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (or, if such borrowing is a borrowing of Initial
Term Loan, Sections 5.01 and 5.02) and receipt of all of the proceeds of the applicable Loan, the Administrative Agent
will make the proceeds of such Loans received by it available to the Borrower on the day of the proposed Term Loan by causing an amount,
in immediately available funds, equal to the proceeds of all such Loans received by the Administrative Agent in the Administrative Agent’s
Account to be deposited in the account designated by the Borrower in the applicable Notice of Borrowing.
 
(iii)            Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender prior to 12:00 p.m. (New York time) on the proposed date
of any borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that each applicable Lender has made the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent on
the applicable borrowing day and the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, may, but shall not be obligated to, cause a corresponding
amount to be made available to the Borrower on such day. If the Administrative Agent makes such corresponding amount available to the
Borrower and such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by any such Lender, the Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such payment was due until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate
for three (3) Business Days. Upon any such failure by a Lender to pay the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
thereafter notify the Borrower of such failure and the Borrower shall promptly pay any such corresponding amount to the Administrative
Agent for its own account.
 


61 
 

 
(iv)            Nothing
in this subsection 2.02(c) shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligations to fulfill its Commitments hereunder.
 
Section 2.03            Repayment
of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
 
(a)            The outstanding unpaid principal of the Term Loans and all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and payable in full on the December 31, 2025 Final Maturity Date.
 
(b)            Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an

including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
 
(c)            The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to
become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.
 
(d)            The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of
this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner
affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Term Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event of any
conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent, the
accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.
 
(e)            Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a note. In
such event, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender a note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to
such Lender and its registered assigns). Thereafter, the Term Loans evidenced by such note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including after assignment pursuant to Section 12.07) be represented by one or more notes payable to the payee named
therein and its registered assigns.

in accordance with Section 2.05(c)(ix).

Repayment. On or before February 28, 2022, the Borrower shall make a repayment of the Initial Term Loan in an aggregate amount
equal to $8,500,000 (the “February 2022 Repayment”). The February 2022 Repayment shall reduce the face amount

of Payments. Each prepayment pursuant to subsections (c)(i), (c)(ii), (c)(iii), (c)(iv), (c)(v),
(c)(vi), and (c)(vii) above shall be applied to the Term Loans (for the avoidance of doubt, pro rata as between the
Initial Term Loan (after giving effect to the amount of February 2022 Repayment) and the Delayed Draw Term Loans (if any)), until
paid in full. Prepayments (other than pursuant to subsection (c)(i) and (c)(viii)) of the Term Loans shall be applied
against the remaining installments of principal of the Term Loans (including the final payment of the Term Loans on the Final Maturity
Date) in the inverse order of maturity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, if the Administrative Agent has elected, or has been directed by the Collateral Agent or the Required Lenders, to apply payments
in respect of any Obligations in accordance with Section 4.03(b), prepayments required under Section 2.05(c) shall be
applied in the manner set forth in Section 4.03(b).
 
(d)           Interest,
Fees and Prepayment Premium. Any prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be accompanied by (i) accrued
interest in cash on the principal amount being prepaid to the date of prepayment, (ii) any Funding Loss (if any) payable pursuant
to Section 2.09(e) and (iii) the applicable Prepayment Premium, if any, shall be payable in connection with such
voluntary or mandatory prepayment under subsections (b), (c)(ii), (c)(iv), (c)(vi) and (c)(vi) of
the Term Loans.

Prepayments. Payments with respect to any subsection of this Section 2.05 are without duplication of payments made or required
to be made under any other subsection of this Section 2.05.
 
(f)            Notice

obligation to make a payment of a Mandatory Amortization Amount under Section 2.05(c) at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the date of such payment, and each such notice shall specify the date of such prepayment, provide a reasonably detailed
calculation of the amount of such payment and contain the Prepayment Premium (if any) applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent will
promptly notify each Lender of the contents of any such payment notice so received from the Borrower, including the date on which such

(a)            Any
and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made without
deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith
discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding
Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount
deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax,
then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction and withholding has been
made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.07) the applicable
Recipient receives the amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
 
(b)            Each
Loan Party shall pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law any Other Taxes, or, at the option of the
Administrative Agent, timely reimburse it for the payment of any Other Taxes.

required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate
as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(i)            Any
Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit
such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested
by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such
Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding
two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections
2.07(d)(i)(A), (i)(B) and (i)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment
such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice
the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

limiting the generality of the foregoing,
 
(A)           any
Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender

Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
 
(B)            any
Lender that is not a U.S. Person (a “Foreign Lender”) shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be reasonably requested by the recipient) on or prior
to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable
request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from,
or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect
to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction

2.            executed
copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;

Revenue Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.09(d)-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not
a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, a “10 percent shareholder”
of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation”
described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and
(y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or
 


68 
 

 
4.            to
the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS
Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.09(d)-2 or Exhibit 2.09(d)-3, IRS
Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender
is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such
Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.09(d)-4 on behalf of each such
direct and indirect partner;
 
(C)            any
Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number
of copies as shall be reasonably requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under
this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies
of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax,
duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)            if
a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were
to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of
the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times
prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed
by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to
comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA
or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA”
shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification
it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly
notify the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(e)            Each
Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes
attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such
Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s
failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.07(i) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any
Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any
Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to
any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent
to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative
Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).
 


69 
 

 
(f)            If
any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.07 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.07),
it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.07
with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party
and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying
party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph
(f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified
party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f),
in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (f) the
payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been
in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the
indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to
require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential)
to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
(g)            Each
party’s obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment
of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all
obligations under any Loan Document.
 
(h)            As
soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, such Loan Party
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing
such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.
 
(i)            For
purposes of this Section, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.
 
Section 2.08            Tax
Treatment. The parties hereto agree (a) that the Term Loans shall be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (b) that
the Term Loans are not governed by the rules set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1275-4, (c) that the Term Loans
are being issued with “original issue discount” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Internal Revenue Code, (d) that
the Term Loans are part of an investment unit within the meaning of Section 1273(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, and (e) to
adhere to this Agreement for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not to take any action or file any tax return, report or declaration
in

ect any Secured Party to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described
in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) with respect to this Agreement
or any Term Loan made by such Agent or such Lender, (ii) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement against any Term Loan or against assets of or held by, or deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, such
Secured Party or any Person controlling such Secured Party or (iii) impose on such Secured Party or any Person controlling such
Secured Party any other condition regarding this Agreement or any Term Loan, and the result of any event referred to in clauses (i),
(ii) or (iii) above shall be to increase the cost to such Secured Party of making any Term Loan or agreeing to make any Term
Loan, or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Secured Party hereunder, then, upon demand by such Secured Party, the Borrower
shall pay to such Secured Party such additional amounts as will compensate such Secured Party for such increased costs or reductions
in amount.
 
(b)            If
any Change in Law either (i) affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Secured
Party or any Person controlling such Secured Party, and such Secured Party determines that the amount of such capital is increased as
a direct or indirect consequence of any Term Loans made or maintained, such Secured Party’s or such other controlling Person’s
other obligations hereunder, or (ii) has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Secured Party’s or
such other controlling Person’s capital to a level below that which such Secured Party or such controlling Person could have achieved
but for such circumstances as a consequence of any Term Loans made or maintained, or any agreement to make Loans or such Secured Party’s
or such other controlling Person’s other obligations hereunder (in each case, taking into consideration, such Secured Party’s
or such other controlling Person’s policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, upon demand by such Secured Party, the Borrower
shall pay to such Secured Party from time to time such additional amounts as will compensate such Secured Party for such cost of maintaining
such increased capital or such reduction in the rate of return on such Secured Party’s or such other controlling Person’s
capital.
 
(c)            All
amounts payable under this Section 2.09 shall bear interest from the date that is 10 days after the date of demand by any
Secured Party until payment in full to such Secured Party at the Reference Rate. A certificate of such Secured Party claiming compensation
under this Section 2.09, specifying the event herein above described and the nature of such event shall be submitted by such Secured
Party to the Borrower, setting forth the additional amount due and an explanation of the calculation thereof, and such Secured Party’s
reasons for invoking the provisions of this Section 2.09, and shall be final and conclusive absent manifest error.
 


71 
 

 
(d)            Failure
or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.09 shall
not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required
to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.09 for any increased costs incurred or reductions
suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased
costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise
to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period
of retroactive effect thereof).
 
(e)            The
obligations of the Loan Parties under this Section 2.09 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of
the Term Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
Section 2.10            Changes
in Law; Impracticability or Illegality.
 
(a)            The
LIBOR Rate may be adjusted by the Administrative Agent with respect to any Lender on a prospective basis to take into account any additional
or increased costs to such Lender of maintaining or obtaining any eurodollar deposits or increased costs due to changes in applicable
law occurring subsequent to the commencement of the then applicable Interest Period, including changes in tax laws (except changes of
general applicability in corporate income tax laws) and changes in the reserve requirements imposed by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (or any successor), excluding the Reserve Percentage, which additional or increased costs would increase the cost
of funding loans bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate. In any such event, the affected Lender shall give the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent notice of such a determination and adjustment and the Administrative Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender
and, upon its receipt of the notice from the affected Lender, the Borrower may, by notice to such affected Lender (i) require such
Lender to furnish to the Borrower a statement setting forth the basis for adjusting such LIBOR Rate and the method for determining the
amount of such adjustment or (ii) repay the LIBOR Rate Loans with respect to which such adjustment is made (together with any amounts
due under Section 2.07).
 
(b)            In
the event that any change in market conditions or any law, regulation, treaty, or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation
of application thereof, shall at any time after the date hereof, in the reasonable opinion of any Lender, make it unlawful or impractical
for such Lender to fund or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans or to continue such funding or maintaining, or to determine or charge interest rates
at the LIBOR Rate, such Lender shall give notice of such changed circumstances to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and the
Administrative Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and (i) in the case of any LIBOR Rate Loans of such
Lender that are outstanding, the date specified in such Lender’s notice shall be deemed to be the last day of the Interest Period
of such LIBOR Rate Loans, and interest upon the LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender thereafter shall accrue interest at the rate then applicable
to Reference Rate Loans of the same type hereunder and (ii) the Borrower shall not be entitled to elect the LIBOR Option (including
in any borrowing, conversion or continuation then being requested) until such Lender determines that it would no longer be unlawful or
impractical to do so.
 


72 
 

 
(c)            The
obligations of the Loan Parties under this Section 2.10 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Term
Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
Section 2.11            LIBOR
Option.
 
(a)            The
Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, elect to have
interest on all or a portion of the Term Loans be charged at a rate of interest based upon the LIBOR Rate (the “LIBOR Option”)
by notifying the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) at least three Business Days prior to (i) the
proposed borrowing date of a Term Loan (as provided in Section 2.02), (ii) in the case of the conversion of a Reference
Rate Loan to a LIBOR Rate Loan, the commencement of the proposed Interest Period or (iii) in the case of the continuation of a LIBOR
Rate Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan, the last day of the then current Interest Period (the “LIBOR Deadline”). Notice of
the Borrower’s election of the LIBOR Option for a permitted portion of the Term Loans and an Interest Period pursuant to this Section 2.11(a) shall
be made by delivery to the Administrative Agent of (A) a Notice of Borrowing (in the case of the initial making of a Term Loan)
in accordance with Section 2.02 or (B) a written notice (“LIBOR Notice”) prior to the LIBOR Deadline.
Promptly upon its receipt of each such LIBOR Notice, the Administrative Agent shall provide a copy thereof to each of the Lenders. Each
LIBOR Notice shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.
 
(b)            Interest
on LIBOR Rate Loans shall be payable in accordance with Section 2.04. On the last day of each applicable Interest Period,
unless the Borrower properly has exercised the LIBOR Option with respect thereto, the interest rate applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loans
automatically shall convert to the rate of interest then applicable to Reference Rate Loans of the same type hereunder. At any time that
a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower no longer shall have the option to request that any portion
of the Term Loans bear interest at the LIBOR Rate and the Administrative Agent shall have the right to convert the interest rate on all
outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans to the rate of interest then applicable to Reference Rate Loans of the same type hereunder prior to the
last day of the then current Interest Period.
 
(c)            Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Borrower (i) shall have not more than three (3) LIBOR Rate Loans
in effect at any given time, and (ii) only may exercise the LIBOR Option for LIBOR Rate Loans of at least $2,500,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.
 
(d)            The
Borrower may prepay LIBOR Rate Loans at any time; provided, however, that in the event that LIBOR Rate Loans are prepaid on any
date that is not the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, including as a result of any mandatory prepayment pursuant to
Section 2.05(c) or any application of payments or proceeds of Collateral in accordance with Section 4.03
or 4.04 or for any other reason, including early termination of the term of this Agreement or acceleration of all or any portion
of the Obligations pursuant to the terms hereof, the Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold the Agents and the Lenders and their participants
harmless against any and all Funding Losses in accordance with Section 2.12.
 


73 
 

 
(e)            Anything
to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither any Agent nor any Lender, nor any of their participants, is required actually
to acquire eurodollar deposits to fund or otherwise match fund any Obligation as to which interest accrues at the LIBOR Rate. The provisions
of this Article II shall apply as if each Lender or its participants had match funded any Obligation as to which interest is accruing
at the LIBOR Rate by acquiring eurodollar deposits for each Interest Period in the amount of the LIBOR Rate Loans.
 
(f)            Unless
and until a Replacement Rate is implemented in accordance with clause (g) below, if prior to the commencement of any Interest Period
for any LIBOR Rate Loan,
 
(i)             the
Administrative Agent shall have determined that either Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank Eurodollar
market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR
for such Interest Period, including, without limitation, because the Administrative Agent determines that either inadequate or insufficient
quotations of the London interbank offered rate exist or the use of “LIBOR” has been discontinued (any determination of Administrative
Agent to be conclusive and binding absent manifest error), or
 
(ii)            the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that LIBOR does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost
to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their LIBOR Rate Loans for such Interest Period,
 
then the Administrative Agent shall give written
notice to the Borrower and to the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. Until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower
and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (A) the obligations of the Lenders to make LIBOR
Rate Loans, or to continue or convert outstanding Loans as or into LIBOR Rate Loans, shall be suspended and (B) all such affected
Loans shall be converted into Reference Rate Loans on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto.
 


74 
 

 
(g)            Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive
absent manifest error) that (i) the circumstances described in Section 2.11(f)(i) or (f)(ii) have arisen
and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary, (ii) syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include language similar
to that contained in Section 2.11(f), are being executed or amended (as applicable), to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark
interest rate to replace LIBOR or (iii) the supervisor for the administrator of LIBOR or a Governmental Authority has made a public
statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, then the Administrative
Agent, in consultation with the Borrower, shall establish an alternate index rate (the “Replacement Rate”) that the
Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower, reasonably believes is the then prevailing market convention for determining
a rate of interest for leveraged syndicated loans in the United States at such time, in which case the Replacement Rate shall, subject
to the following provisions of this Section 2.11(g), replace such applicable interest rate for all purposes under the Loan
Documents unless and until (A) an event described in Section 2.11(f)(i), (f)(ii), (g)(i), (g)(ii) or
(g)(iii) occurs with respect to the Replacement Rate or (B) the Required Lenders through the Administrative Agent notify
the Borrower that the Replacement Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of making, funding or maintaining
the Term Loans bearing interest at the Replacement Rate. The Administrative Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that any Replacement Rate shall meet the standards set forth in Proposed Section 1.1001-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any successor
or final version of such regulation) so as not to be treated as a “modification” (and therefore an exchange) of this Agreement
for purposes of Section 1.1001-3 of the Treasury Regulations. In connection with the establishment and application of the Replacement
Rate, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be amended solely with the consent of the Administrative Agent, after consultation
with the Borrower, as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.11(g).
To the extent the Replacement Rate is adopted as contemplated hereby, the Replacement Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with
prevailing market convention; provided that, to the extent no prevailing market convention exists or such prevailing market convention
is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Replacement Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably
determined by the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent makes a determination described
in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, until a Replacement Rate has been determined and an amendment with respect thereto has
become effective in accordance with the terms and conditions of this paragraph, (x) any notice from the Borrower that requests the
conversion of any Reference Rate Loan to, or continuation of any LIBOR Rate Loan as, a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be ineffective, and (y) if
any notice of borrowing requests a LIBOR Rate Loan, such Loan shall be made as a Reference Rate Loan. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, if such Replacement Rate as determined in this paragraph is determined to be less than 1.0% per annum, such rate
shall be deemed to be 1.0% per annum for the purposes of this Agreement.
 
Section 2.12            Funding
Losses. In connection with each LIBOR Rate Loan, the Borrower shall indemnify, defend, and hold the Agents and the Lenders harmless
against any loss, cost, or expense incurred by any Agent or any Lender as a result of (a) the payment of any principal of any LIBOR
Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of a Default or an Event of Default
or any mandatory prepayment required pursuant to Section 2.05), (b) the conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loan other than
on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of a Default or an Event of Default) or (c) the
failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBOR Rate Loan on the date specified in any Notice of Borrowing or LIBOR Notice delivered
pursuant hereto (such losses, costs, and expenses, collectively, “Funding Losses”). Funding Losses shall, with respect
to any Agent or any Lender, be deemed to equal the amount reasonably determined by such Agent or such Lender to be the excess, if any,
of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such LIBOR Rate Loan had such event not occurred,
at the LIBOR Rate that would have been applicable thereto, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current
Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest
Period therefor), minus (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate
which such Agent or such Lender would be offered were it to be offered, at the commencement of such period, Dollar deposits of a comparable
amount and period in the London interbank market. A certificate of an Agent or a Lender delivered to the Borrower setting forth any amount
or amounts that such Agent or such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

Article III
 
BORROWING BASE AND ELIGIBILITY ADVANCES
 
Section 3.01            Effective
Date Borrowing Base Certificate. On a date which shall be not later than thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, the Borrower

 “Appraisal”), as prepared by (a) Hilco Global Finance, LLC, with respect to Appraisals of Inventory and Intellectual
Property and (b) Riveron Consulting, LLC, with respect to Field Examination ((a) and (b), the “Appraiser”)
and, in each case, the results of which are satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. In addition, to Field Examination
and the Appraisal, on the Effective Date, the Borrower shall provide the Agent and the Lenders with a Borrowing Base Certificate in accordance
with Exhibit C hereto based on the Eligible Accounts Receivable as at December 31, 2021, the Eligible Inventory as at
December 31, 2021 reflected in the Appraisal and the Eligible Intellectual Property reflected in the Appraisal, less the Reserves
in effect on the Effective Date (the “Effective Date Borrowing Base Certificate”).
 
Section 3.02            Borrowing
Base Certificates. Following the Effective Date, the Borrower shall furnish the Lenders with Borrowing Base Certificates on a monthly
basis on the 20th day of each month, commencing with the month immediately following the month in which the Effective Date occurs setting
forth the calculation of the Borrowing Base as of the last Business Day of the immediately preceding month, duly completed and executed
by a Authorized Officer, together with all schedules required pursuant to the terms of the Borrowing Base Certificate duly completed
(first such Borrowing Base Certificate under this Section 3.02 shall be issued for month ended January 31, 2022 and delivered
on or prior to February 20, 2021); provided, that, in the event on the last Business Day of a month (other than March, June,
September and December) the Senior Leverage Ratio (as evidenced by a duly executed Compliance Certificate delivered by the Borrower
for such calendar month) shall be less than 2.1:1, then, the Borrower shall have the option to not provide a Borrowing Base Certificate
for such month but the Borrowing Base calculation as an for such month shall be delivered together with the next required delivery of
the Borrowing Base Certificate. For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall be required to deliver Borrowing Base Certificates for
each of March, June, September and December regardless of the Senior Leverage Ratio level on the last Business Day of such
months.
 
Section 3.03            Over
Advances. In the event that the Effective Borrowing Base Certificate shall reflect total Eligible Advances that are less than $50,000,000,
the amount by which such Eligible Advances are less than $50,000,000 shall be deemed to be Over Advances. In such event, the Loan Parties
shall repay to the Agent on behalf of the Lenders the amount of such Over-Advances by a date which shall be not later than ten (10) Business
Days after delivery of the Effective Borrowing Base Certificate; failing which an Event of Default may be declared by the Lenders.
 


76 
 

 
Section 3.04            Reserves.
The Lenders may, in the exercise of their Permitted Discretion, establish at any time or from time to time following the Effective Date,
Reserves in subsequent Borrowing Base Certificates that are different from those set forth in the Effective Date Borrowing Base Certificate.
 
Section 3.05            Field
Examination and Appraisals. Subject to the limitations set forth below, the Borrower shall also cooperate with (and cause the other
Loan Parties to cooperate with) the Administrative Agent in connection with the conducting of Field Examinations and appraisals of the
Loan Parties’ Inventory and Intellectual Property, which appraisals shall be in form and detail and from third-party appraisers
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (each such appraisal, an “Inventory Appraisal”) for the purpose
of determining the amount of the Borrowing Base attributable to Inventory; provided, however, that
 
(a)            The
Administrative Agent may undertake investigations and reviews of each Loan Party’s property, insurance, practices in the computation
of the Borrowing Base and related financial information such as, but not limited to, sales, gross margins, payables, accruals and reserves
at the reasonable expense of the Borrowers (including field audits conducted by the Administrative Agent) (“Field Examination”)
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent (A) may undertake, at the Borrower’s expense, up to two (2) Field Examinations
during any twelve-month period and (B) may undertake, at any time during the continuation of an Event of Default, Field Examinations
as frequently as determined by the Administrative Agent in its Permitted Discretion at the Borrowers’ expense; provided
that if during an Fiscal Year, the Borrower’s Senior Leverage Ratio is less than 1.5:1.0 at all times (and only so long as no Event
of Default has occurred in such Fiscal Year), then Borrower shall not be obligated to pay for more than one (1) Field Examination
during such Fiscal Year.
 
(b)            Permit
the Administrative Agent after reasonable prior notice or professionals retained by the Administrative Agent to conduct appraisals of
the Accounts, Intellectual Property and Inventory of the Loan Parties. The Administrative Agent (A) may undertake, at the Borrower’s
expense, (i) two (2) appraisals of the Loan Parties’ Inventory and (ii) one (1) appraisal of the Loan Parties’
Intellectual Property, in each case, during any twelve-month period and (B) may undertake at any time during the continuation of

Discretion at the Borrowers’ expense; provided that if during an Fiscal Year, the Borrower’s Senior Leverage Ratio
is less than 1.5:1.0 at all times (and only so long as no Event of Default has occurred in such Fiscal Year), then Borrower shall not
be obligated to pay for more than one (1) appraisals of the Loan Parties’ Inventory, and one (1) appraisals of the Loan
Parties’ Intellectual Property during such Fiscal Year.
 
(c)            The
Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent any information that the Administrative Agent may reasonable request regarding the
determination and calculation of the Borrowing Base including correct and complete copies of any invoices, underlying agreements, instruments
or other documents and the identity of all Account Debtors in respect of Accounts Receivables referred to therein.
 


77 
 

 
(d)            Nothing
contained in any Borrowing Base Certificate shall be deemed to limit, impair or otherwise affect the rights of the Administrative Agent
contained herein and in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the calculation of the Borrowing Base, as set forth in any
Borrowing Base Certificate, and as reasonably determined by Administrative Agent in its good faith, the determination of Administrative
Agent shall govern and be conclusive and binding upon Borrower and Guarantors, absent manifest error. Without limiting the foregoing,

Article IV
 
PAYMENTS AND OTHER COMPENSATION
 
Section 4.01            Payments;
Computations and Statements. (a)  The Borrower will make each payment under this Agreement not later than 1:00 p.m. (New
York time) on the day when due, in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds, to the Administrative
Agent’s Account. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on any Business Day shall,
in the Administrative Agent’s discretion, be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or
fee shall continue to accrue. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment
of principal and interest ratably to the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares and like funds relating to the payment of any
other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All payments
shall be made by the Borrower without set-off, counterclaim, deduction or other defense to the Agents and the Lenders. Whenever any payment
to be made under any such Loan Document shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as the
case may be; provided, however, that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of LIBOR Rate Loans to
be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. All computations
of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the
first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative
Agent of an interest rate or fees hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes in the absence of manifest error.
 


78 
 

 
(b)            Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that
the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable
Lenders, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower did not in fact make such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders, severally
agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds
with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed by the Administrative Agent to but excluding
the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate reasonably determined
by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any reasonable administrative,
processing, or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing.
 
Section 4.02            Sharing
of Payments, Defaulting Lenders, Etc.
 
(a)            The
Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments made by any Borrower to the Administrative
Agent for the Defaulting Lender’s benefit, and, in the absence of such transfer to the Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent
shall transfer any such payments to each other non-Defaulting Lender ratably in accordance with their Commitments (but only to the extent
that such Defaulting Lender’s Loan was funded by the other Lenders) or, if so directed by the Borrower and if no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing (and to the extent such Defaulting Lender’s Loan was not funded by the other Lenders),
retain the same to be re-advanced to the Borrower as if such Defaulting Lender had made such Loans to the Borrower. Subject to the foregoing,
the Administrative Agent may hold and, in its discretion, re-lend to the Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Lender the amount
of all such payments received and retained by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender. This Section shall
remain effective with respect to such Lender until (x) the Obligations (other than unasserted contingent indemnification Obligations)
under this Agreement shall have been declared or shall have become immediately due and payable, (y) the non-Defaulting Lenders,
the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower shall have waived such Defaulting Lender’s default in writing, or (z) the Defaulting
Lender makes its Pro Rata Share of the applicable defaulted Loan and pays to the Administrative Agent all amounts owing by such Defaulting
Lender in respect thereof. The operation of this Section shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of
any Lender, to relieve or excuse the performance by such Defaulting Lender or any other Lender of its duties and obligations hereunder,
or to relieve or excuse the performance by the Borrower of its duties and obligations hereunder to the Administrative Agent or to the
Lenders other than such Defaulting Lender. Any such failure to fund by any Defaulting Lender shall constitute a material breach by such
Defaulting Lender of this Agreement and shall entitle the Borrower at its option, subject to the written consent of the Administrative
Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), to permanently replace the Defaulting Lender with one or more substitute Lenders
(each, a “Replacement Lender”), and the Defaulting Lender shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder.
Notice from the Borrower to the Agents effecting their right to replace the Defaulting Lender shall specify an effective date for such
replacement, which date shall not be later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date such notice is given. Prior to the effective
date of such replacement, the Defaulting Lender and each Replacement Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance, subject
only to the Defaulting Lender being repaid its share of the outstanding Obligations without any premium or penalty of any kind whatsoever.
If the Defaulting Lender shall refuse or fail to execute and deliver any such Assignment and Acceptance prior to the effective date of
such replacement, the Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance. The replacement
of any Defaulting Lender shall be made in accordance with the terms of Section 12.07(b). Any such assumption of the Commitment
of such Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any of the Lenders’ or the Borrower’s rights or remedies
against any such Defaulting Lender arising out of or in relation to such failure to fund.
 


79 
 

 
(b)            Except
as provided in Section 2.02 or Section 12.07, if any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary,
through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of any Obligation in excess of its ratable share of payments on
account of similar obligations obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations
in such similar obligations held by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with
each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing
Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to
the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the
amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender of any interest
or other amount paid by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered); provided, the provisions of this Section 4.02(b) shall
not be construed to apply to any payment made by or on behalf of any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
(including, without limitation, as provided in Section 2.05 and the application of funds arising from the existence of a
Defaulting Lender) The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 4.02(b) may,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all of its rights (including the Lender’s right of set-off) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
Section 4.03            Apportionment
of Payments.  Subject to Section 2.02 or Section 12.07 hereof and to any written agreement among
the Agents and/or the Lenders:
 
(a)            all
payments of principal and interest in respect of outstanding Loans, all payments of fees (other than the fees set forth in Sections
2.06 and 7.01(f) hereof) and all other payments in respect of any other Obligations, shall be allocated by the Administrative
Agent among such of the Lenders as are entitled thereto, in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares or otherwise as provided herein
or, in respect of payments not made on account of Loans, as designated by the Person making payment when the payment is made.
 
(b)            After
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may, and upon the direction of the Required
Lenders shall (or in the case of an acceleration of the Obligations, the Administrative Agent shall), apply all proceeds of the Collateral
and all amounts received by the Administrative Agent on account of the Obligations (i) first, ratably to pay the Obligations in
respect of any fees, expense reimbursements, indemnities and other amounts then due and payable to the Agents until paid in full; (ii) second,
ratably to pay the Obligations in respect of any fees (other than any Prepayment Premium) and indemnities then due and payable to the
Lenders until paid in full; (iii) third, ratably to pay interest then due and payable in respect of the Term Loans (for the avoidance
of doubt, pro rata as between the Initial Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loans (if any)) until paid in full; (iv) fourth, ratably
to pay principal of the Term Loans (for the avoidance of doubt, pro rata as between the Initial Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loans
(if any)) until paid in full; (v) fifth, ratably to pay the Obligations in respect of any Prepayment Premium then due and payable
to the Lenders until paid in full; and (vi) sixth, to the ratable payment of all other Obligations then due and payable.
 


80 
 

 
(c)            The
term “paid in full” means payment in cash of all amounts owing under the Loan Documents, including all principal, loan fees,
service fees, professional fees, interest (and specifically including interest accrued after the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding),
default interest, interest on interest, Prepayment Premium and expense reimbursements, whether or not same would be or is allowed or
disallowed in whole or in part in any Insolvency Proceeding.

so received; (ii) to distribute to each Lender copies of all material notices and agreements received by such Agent and not required

(ix) to act with respect to all Collateral under the Loan Documents, including for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing
any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Obligations. As to any matters not expressly
provided for by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Term Loans.
  
   (b)      The
Administrative Agent shall also act as the Collateral Agent under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints
and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of (and to hold any security interest, charge or other Lien created by the
Loan Documents for and on behalf of or in trust for) such Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on

incidental thereto (including as vertegenwoordiger/représentant for the purposes of article 5 of the Belgian Financial

authorize the Administrative Agent as Collateral Agent to execute any and all documents (including releases) with respect to the Collateral
and the rights of the Secured Parties with respect thereto, as contemplated by and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
and the Loan Documents and acknowledge and agree that any such action by any Agent shall bind the Lenders.
 


127 
 


 
   (c)      The
Agents shall not be required to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is required to exercise
as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for
herein or in the other Loan Documents ), and such instructions of the Required Lenders (or such other percentage of Lenders) shall be
binding upon all Lenders and all makers of Loans; provided, however, that neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral
Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent or
the Collateral Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law.
 
   (d)      Any
corporation or association into which any Agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may be consolidated, or to which it may
sell or transfer all or substantially all of its corporate trust business and assets as a whole or substantially as a whole, or any corporation
or association resulting from any such conversion, sale, merger, consolidation or transfer to which such Agent is a party, will be and
become the successor Agent, as applicable, under this Agreement and will have and succeed to the rights, powers, duties, immunities and
privileges as its predecessor, without the execution or filing of any instrument or paper or the performance of any further act.
 
Section 10.02	     Nature
of Duties; Delegation. The Agents shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement or
in the other Loan Documents. The duties of the Agents shall be mechanical and administrative in nature. The Agents shall not have by
reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender, regardless of whether a Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, express or implied, is intended
to or shall be construed to impose upon the Agents any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document except as
expressly set forth herein or therein. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender shall make its own independent
investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the Loan Parties in connection with the making and the continuance of the Term
Loans hereunder and shall make its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and the value of the Collateral without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties, and neither the Agents nor any of their Related
Parties shall have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information with respect thereto, whether coming into their possession before the initial Loan hereunder or at any time or times thereafter.
Each Lender acknowledges that the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and their Affiliates have not made any representation or
warranty to it, other than any such representations or warranties expressly provided for hereunder or under any other Loan Document.
Except for documents or other information expressly required by any Loan Document to be transmitted by the Administrative Agent and/or
the Collateral Agent to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility (either
express or implied) to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning any Loan Party, including the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or Affiliate of a Loan Party, that may come
in to the possession of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any of their Affiliates. Each Agent may, upon any term or condition
it specifies, delegate or exercise any of its rights, powers and remedies under, and delegate or perform any of its duties or any other
action with respect to, any Loan Document by or through any of its Related Parties or any other trustee, co-agent, sub-agent or Person
(including any Lender). The exculpatory provisions of this Article X and the indemnity provisions of Section 12.15 shall
apply to any such trustee, co-agent, sub-agent or Person and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent
and any such trustee, co-agent, sub-agent or Person, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with activities as
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be responsible for the negligence
or misconduct of any of its trustees, co-agents, sub-agents, except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in
a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, acted with gross negligence
or willful misconduct in the selection of such trustees, co-agents or sub-agents, as applicable.
 


128 
 

 
Section 10.03	     Rights,
Exculpation, Etc. The Agents and their Related Parties shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by them (i) with
the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as
the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances provided in
Section 9.01 or Section 12.02) or (ii)  except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined
by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agents
(i) may treat the payee of any Term Loan as the owner thereof until such Loan has been transferred to a transferee pursuant to and
in accordance with Section 12.07 hereof; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel
to any Agent or counsel to the Loan Parties), independent public accountants, and other experts selected by any of them and shall not
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by any of them in accordance with the advice of such counsel or experts;
(iii) make no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any statements, certificates,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; (iv) shall not be responsible
for or have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents on the part of any Person, the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default,
or to inspect the Collateral or other property (including, without limitation, the books and records) of any Person; (v) shall not
be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement
or the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (vi) shall not be responsible
for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into the, value, sufficiency or collectability of the Collateral, the creation, existence,
priority or perfection of the Collateral Agent’s Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith,
nor shall the Agents be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral and
(vii) shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article V or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent
or satisfaction of any condition that expressly refers to the matters described therein being acceptable or satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent. The Agents shall not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments made in good faith, and if any such apportionment
or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole recourse of any Lender to whom payment was due but not
made, shall be to recover from other Lenders any payment in excess of the amount which they are determined to be entitled (and such other
Lenders hereby agree to return to such Lender any such erroneous payments received by them). The Agents may at any time request instructions
from the Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this Agreement or of any of the other Loan Documents
the Agents are permitted or required to take or to grant, and if such instructions are promptly requested, the Agents shall be absolutely
entitled to refrain from taking any action or to withhold any approval under any of the Loan Documents until they shall have received
such instructions from the Required Lenders (unless unanimity is required) and, if they so request, the Agents shall first be indemnified
to their satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by reason of taking or continuing
to take any such action. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against any Agent as a result
of such Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions
of the Required Lenders (unless unanimity is required). The Agents shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or
any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or
any of their respective Affiliates in any capacity. The Agents shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any
Default or Event of Default, unless the Agents shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement,
describing such Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.”
 


129 
 


 
In no event shall any Agent
be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of their respective obligations under this Agreement or any related documents because
of circumstances beyond such Agent’s control, including, but not limited to, a failure, termination or suspension of a clearing
house, securities depositary, settlement system or central payment system in any applicable part of the world or acts of God, flood,
war (whether declared or undeclared), civil or military disturbances or hostilities, nuclear or natural catastrophes, political unrest,
explosion, severe weather or accident, earthquake, terrorism, fire, riot, labor disturbances, strikes or work stoppages for any
reason, embargo, government action, including any laws, ordinance, regulations or the like (whether domestic, federal, state, county
or municipal or foreign) which delay, restrict or prohibit the providing of services contemplated by this Agreement or any related documents,
or the unavailability of communications or computer facilities, the failure of equipment or interruption of communications or computer
facilities, or the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire or telex or other wire or communication facility, or any other causes
beyond the Agent’s control whether or not of the same class or kind as specified above. Nothing in this Agreement or any other
Loan Document shall require the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers hereunder.
 


130 
 


 
The Agents shall have no obligation
for (a) perfecting, maintaining, monitoring, preserving or protecting the security interest or Lien granted under the Credit Agreement,
any other Loan Document, or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby; (b) the filing, re-filing, recording, re-recording,
or continuing of any document, financing statement, mortgage, assignment, notice, instrument of further assurance, or other instrument
in any public office at any time or times; or (c) providing, maintaining, monitoring, or preserving insurance on or the payment
of taxes with respect to any Collateral.
 
The Agents shall not (x) be
obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender or participant in the Term Loans or prospective Lender or participant
in the Term Loans is an Ineligible Institution or (y) have any liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or participation
of Loans, or disclosure of confidential information, to any Ineligible Institution.
 
Section 10.04	     Reliance.
Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any written notices, statements, certificates,
orders or other documents or any telephone message believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent
or made by the proper Person, and with respect to all matters pertaining to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and its
duties hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the
making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such
condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice to the contrary from such
Lender prior to the making of such Loan.
 
Section 10.05	     Indemnification.
To the extent that any Agent or any Related Party of the foregoing is not reimbursed and indemnified by any Loan Party (and without limiting
the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), the Lenders will indemnify and hold harmless such Agent and such Related Parties from and
against any and all Agent Indemnified Matters of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against
such Agent and such Related Parties in proportion to each Lender’s Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that the applicable
indemnity payment is sought (or if such indemnity payment is sought after the date on which the Term Loans have been paid in full and
the Commitments have terminated, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares immediately prior to the date on which the Term
Loans are paid in full and the Commitments have terminated)); provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion
of such Agent Indemnified Matters for which there has been a final non-appealable judicial determination that such liability resulted
from such Agent’s or such Related Parties gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, further, however, that no action
taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be provided
by the Loan Documents) shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for the purposes of this Section 10.05.
In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Agent Indemnified Matters, this Section 10.05
shall apply whether or not any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender or any other Person. Without limiting
the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Agents upon demand for its Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that the applicable
reimbursement is sought (or if such reimbursement payment is sought after the date on which the Term Loans have been paid in full and
the Commitments have terminated, in accordance with its Pro Rata Shares immediately prior to the date on which the Term Loans are paid
in full and the Commitments have terminated)) of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees, disbursements and other charges
of counsel) incurred by the Agents in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities
under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Agents
are not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Loan Parties; provided that such reimbursement by the Lenders shall
not affect the Borrower’s continuing reimbursement obligations with respect thereto; provided further, that failure of any
Lender to indemnify or reimburse the Agents shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation in respect thereof. Each Lender hereby
authorizes the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under
any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent to such Lender from any source against any
amount due to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under this Section 10.05. The obligations of the Lenders under
this Section 10.05 shall survive the payment in full of the Term Loans and the termination of this Agreement.
 


131 
 


 
Section 10.06	     Agents
Individually. With respect to its Pro Rata Share and the Term Loans made by it, if applicable, each Agent shall have and may exercise
the same rights and powers hereunder and is subject to the same obligations and liabilities as and to the extent set forth herein, as
any other Lender or maker of a Loan. If applicable, the terms “Lenders” or “Required Lenders” or any similar
terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include each Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender or one of the
Required Lenders. Each Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of banking,
trust or other business with any Borrower or Affiliate thereof as if it were not acting as an Agent pursuant hereto without any duty
to account to the other Lenders.
 
Section 10.07	     Successor
Agent.
 
   (a)      Any
Agent may at any time give at least 30 days prior written notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Any Agent may be
removed at any time by the Required Lenders upon at least 30 days prior written notice by the Required Lenders to such Agent. Upon receipt
of any such notice of resignation or delivery of any such notice of removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation
with the Borrower, to appoint a successor Agent. If no such successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and
shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as
shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective Date”) or within 30 days after delivery of any
such notice of removal (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Removal Effective Date”),
as applicable, then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent. Whether
or not a successor Agent has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation
Effective Date or such removal shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date, as applicable.
 


132 
 


 
   (b)      With
effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable, (i) the retiring Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any Collateral held by such
Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until
such time as a successor Agent is appointed) and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to
or through such retiring Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as a successor Agent shall
have been appointed as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s Agent’s appointment as Agent hereunder, such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring
Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. After the retiring Agent’s
resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article, Section 12.04 and Section 12.05
shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while the retiring Agent was acting as Agent.
 
Section 10.08	     Collateral
Matters.
 
   (a)      The
Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent to (1) release any Lien granted to or held by the Collateral Agent upon
any Collateral (i) in accordance with the express terms of the Loan Documents; (ii) upon termination of all Commitments and
payment and satisfaction of all Term Loans and all other Obligations in accordance with the terms hereof; or (iii) (x) constituting
property being sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of any Loan Party’s business and otherwise in compliance with the terms
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (y) constituting property in which the Loan Parties owned no interest at the time
the Lien was granted or at any time thereafter; or (z) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Lenders or (2) subordinate
any Lien on any property granted to or sold by the Collateral Agent to the holder of any Lien on property that is permitted to be subordinated
pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Liens”. Upon request by the Collateral Agent at any time, the Lenders shall confirm
in writing the Collateral Agent’s authority to release or subordinate particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this
Agreement.
 
   (b)      Without
in any manner limiting the Collateral Agent’s authority to act without any specific or further authorization or consent by the
Lenders (as set forth in Section 10.08(b)), each Lender agrees to confirm in writing, upon request by the Collateral Agent,
the authority to release or subordinate Collateral conferred upon the Collateral Agent under Section 10.08(b). Upon receipt
by the Collateral Agent of confirmation from the Required Lenders (or all Lenders if applicable) of its authority to release or subordinate
any particular item or types of Collateral, and upon prior written request by any Loan Party, the Collateral Agent shall (and is hereby
irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted to
the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders upon such Collateral; provided, however, that (i) the
Collateral Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in the Collateral Agent’s opinion, would expose
the Collateral Agent to liability or create any obligations or entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse
or warranty, and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or any Lien upon (or obligations
of any Loan Party in respect of) all interests in the Collateral retained by any Loan Party.
 


133 
 


 
   (c)      Anything
contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the Loan Parties, each Agent and each Lender hereby agree that
(i) no Lender shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral under any Loan Document or to enforce any
Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under the Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in accordance with the terms thereof, (ii) in the event of a foreclosure by the
Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any
Lender may be the purchaser of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale and (iii) the Collateral Agent, as agent for and representative
of the Agents and the Lenders (but not any other Agent or any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless
the Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles)
for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral to be sold
(A) at any public or private sale, (B) at any sale conducted by the Collateral Agent under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial
Code (including pursuant to Sections 9-610 or 9-620 of the Uniform Commercial Code), (C) at any sale or foreclosure conducted by
the Collateral Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with applicable law or (D) any sale conducted pursuant
to the provisions of any Debtor Relief Law (including Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code), to use and apply all or any of the Obligations
as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at such sale.
 
   (d)      The
Collateral Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any Lender to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by the Loan Parties
or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered or that the Lien granted to the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document has been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or is entitled to
any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue
exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or available to the Collateral Agent in this Section 10.08
or in any other Loan Document, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission or event related
thereto, the Collateral Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion, and that the Collateral Agent shall
have no duty or liability whatsoever to any other Lender, except as otherwise provided herein.
 
Section 10.09	     Agency
for Perfection. Each Agent and each Lender hereby appoints each other Agent and each other Lender as agent and bailee for the purpose
of perfecting the security interests in and liens upon the Collateral in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code, can be perfected only by possession or control (or where the security interest of a secured party with possession or
control has priority over the security interest of another secured party) and each Agent and each Lender hereby acknowledges that it
holds possession of or otherwise controls any such Collateral for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders as secured party. Should
the Administrative Agent or any Lender obtain possession or control of any such Collateral, the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall
notify the Collateral Agent thereof, and, promptly upon the Collateral Agent’s request therefor shall deliver such Collateral to
the Collateral Agent or in accordance with the Collateral Agent’s instructions. In addition, the Collateral Agent shall also have
the power and authority hereunder to appoint such other sub-agents as may be necessary or required under applicable state law or otherwise
to perform its duties and enforce its rights with respect to the Collateral and under the Loan Documents. Each Loan Party by its execution
and delivery of this Agreement hereby consents to the foregoing.
 


134 
 


 
Section 10.10	     No
Reliance on any Agent’s Customer Identification Program. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that neither such Lender, nor
any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees, may rely on any Agent to carry out such Lender’s, Affiliate’s, participant’s
or assignee’s customer identification program, or other requirements imposed by the USA PATRIOT Act or the regulations issued thereunder,
including the regulations set forth in 31 C.F.R. §§ 1010.100(yy), (iii), 1020.100, and 1020.220 (formerly 31 C.F.R. §
103.121), as hereafter amended or replaced (“CIP Regulations”), or any other Anti-Money Launderin

 own responsibilities under the CIP Regulations.
 
Section 10.11	     No
Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Secured Parties, and no Loan Party
shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.
 
Section 10.12	     No
Fiduciary Relationship. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Document
(or any other similar term) with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations
arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create
or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. By becoming a party to this Agreement, each Lender:
 
   (a)      is
deemed to have requested that each Agent furnish such Lender, promptly after it becomes available, a copy of each inspection report (if
any) with respect to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a “Report”) prepared by or at the request of such
Agent, and each Agent shall so furnish each Lender with each such Report,
 
   (b)      expressly
agrees and acknowledges that the Agents (i) do not make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any Reports, and (ii) shall
not be liable for any information contained in any Reports,
 


135 
 

 
   (c)      expressly
agrees and acknowledges that the Reports are not comprehensive audits or examinations, that any Agent or other party performing any audit
or examination will inspect only specific information regarding the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and will rely significantly upon the
Borrower’s and its Subsidiaries’ books and records, as well as on representations of their personnel,

 
   (d)      agrees
to keep all Reports and other material, non-public information regarding the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and their operations, assets,
and existing and contemplated business plans in a confidential manner in accordance with Section 12.20, and
 
   (e)      without
limiting the generality of any other indemnification provision contained in this Agreement, agrees: (i) to hold any Agent and any
other Lender preparing a Report harmless from any action the indemnifying Lender may take or fail to take or any conclusion the indemnifying
Lender may reach or draw from any Report in connection with any loans or other credit accommodations that the indemnifying Lender has
made or may make to the Borrower, or the indemnifying Lender’s participation in, or the indemnifying Lender’s purchase of,
a loan or loans of the Borrower, and (ii) to pay and protect, and indemnify, defend and hold any Agent and any other Lender preparing
a Report harmless from and against, the claims, actions, proceedings, damages, costs, expenses, and other amounts (including, attorneys’
fees and costs) incurred by any such Agent and any such other Lender preparing a Report as the direct or indirect result of any third
parties who might obtain all or part of any Report through the indemnifying Lender.
 
Section 10.13	     Collateral
Custodian. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Collateral Agent or its designee may at any
time and from time to time employ and maintain on the premises of any Loan Party a custodian selected by the Collateral Agent or its
designee who shall have full authority to do all acts necessary to protect the Agents’ and the Lenders’ interests. Each Loan
Party hereby agrees to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with any such custodian and to do whatever the Collateral Agent or
its designee may reasonably request to preserve the Collateral.
 
Section 10.14	     Collateral
Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial
proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Collateral Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Term Loan shall then be due
and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether any Agent shall have made any demand on the
Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
 
   (a)      to
file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Term Loans and all other
Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of
the Secured Parties (including any claim for the compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Secured Parties and their
respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due to the Secured Parties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents) allowed
in such judicial proceeding; and
 


136 
 

 
   (b)      to
collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

 
   (c)      and
any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby
authorized by each Secured Party to make such payments to the Collateral Agent and, in the event that the Collateral Agent shall consent
to the making of such payments directly to the Secured Parties, to pay to the Collateral Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Collateral Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Collateral
Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.
 
Section 10.15	     Withholding
Taxes. To the extent required by any applicable Requirement of Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any
Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the United States Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental
Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any
Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative
Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective or for any other reason,
or if the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that a payment was made to a Lender pursuant to this Agreement without deduction
of applicable withholding Tax from such payment, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully, within 10 days after written
demand therefor, for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including any penalties
or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred.
A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent
a manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any amounts at any time owing to such Lender
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 10.15.
The agreements in this Section 10.15 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment
of rights by, or replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other
Obligations.
 
Section 10.16	     Parallel
Debt
 
   (a)      Each
Loan Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes to pay to the Collateral Agent amounts equal to the amounts due in respect
of the Corresponding Obligations as they may exist from time to time. The payment undertakings of each Loan Party under this Section 10.16 are
each to be referred to as a “Parallel Debt”.
 
   (b)      Each
Parallel Debt will be payable in the currency or currencies of the relevant Corresponding Obligations and will become due and payable
as and when and to the extent the relevant Corresponding Obligations become due and payable. An Event of Default in respect of the payment
of the Corresponding Obligations shall constitute a default within the meaning of section 3:248 Dutch Civil Code with respect to the
payment of the Parallel Debts without any notice being required.
 


137 
 

 
   (c)        Each
of the Parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledges that:

 
(i)      each
Parallel Debt constitutes an undertaking, obligation and liability to the Collateral Agent which is separate and independent from, and
without prejudice to, the Corresponding Obligations of the relevant Loan Party;
 
(ii)     each
Parallel Debt represents the Collateral Agent’s own separate and independent claim to receive payment of the Parallel Debt from
the relevant Loan Party; and
 
(iii)    it
being understood, in each case, that the amounts which may be payable by each Loan Party as Parallel Debt at any time shall never exceed
the total of the amounts which are payable under or in connection with the Corresponding Obligations at that time.
 
   (d)        An
amount paid by a Loan Party to the Agent in respect of a Parallel Debt will discharge the liability of the Loan Parties under the Corresponding
Obligations in an equal amount.
 
   (e)        For
the purpose of this Section 10.16, the Collateral Agent acts in its own name and for the benefit of the Secured Parties,
but not as representative of the Secured Parties.
 
   (f)        For
purposes of any Dutch Security Document, any resignation by the Collateral Agent is not effective with respect to its rights under the
Parallel Debts until all rights and obligations under the Parallel Debts have been assigned and assumed to the successor Agent appointed
in accordance with Section 10.07.
 
   (g)        The
Collateral Agent will reasonably cooperate in assigning its rights and obligations under the Parallel Debts to a successor Agent and
will reasonably cooperate in transferring all rights and obligations under any Dutch Security Document to such successor Agent. All other
Parties hereby, in advance, irrevocably grant their cooperation to such transfer of all rights and obligations by the Collateral Agent
to a successor Agent.
 
Article XI
 
GUARANTY
 
Section 11.01	     Guaranty.
Each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally and unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under any Loan Document,
whether for principal, interest (including, without limitation, all interest that accrues after the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding
of any Borrower, whether or not a claim for post-filing interest is allowed in such Insolvency Proceeding), fees, commissions, expense
reimbursements, indemnifications or otherwise (such obligations, to the extent not paid by the Borrower, being the “Guaranteed
Obligations”), and agrees to pay (without duplication of any amounts payable under Section 12.04) any and all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of one outside counsel and
one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction) incurred by the Agents and the Lenders in enforcing any rights under the guaranty set
forth in this ARTICLE XI. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor’s liability shall extend to all
amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by the Borrower to the Agents and the Lenders under any
Loan Document but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of an Insolvency Proceeding involving
any Borrower. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Guaranteed Obligations shall not include any Excluded Hedge Liabilities. In no event
shall the obligation of any Guarantor hereunder exceed the maximum amount such Guarantor could guarantee under any bankruptcy, insolvency
or other similar law.
 


138 
 


 
Section 11.02	     Guaranty
Absolute. Each Guarantor jointly and severally guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with
the terms of the Loan Documents, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting
any of such terms or the rights of the Agents or the Lenders with respect thereto. Each Guarantor agrees that this ARTICLE XI constitutes
a guaranty of payment when due and not of collection and waives any right to require that any resort be made by any Agent or any Lender
to any Collateral. The obligations of each Guarantor under this ARTICLE XI are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations, and a
separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor to enforce such obligations, irrespective of whether
any action is brought against any Loan Party or whether any Loan Party is joined in any such action or actions. The liability of each
Guarantor under this ARTICLE XI shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably
waives any defenses it may now or hereafter have in any way relating to, any or all of the following:
 
   (a)      any
lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any agreement or instrument relating thereto;
 
   (b)      any
change in th

ver of or any consent to departure from any Loan Document, including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations
resulting from the extension of additional credit to any Loan Party or otherwise;
 
   (c)      any
taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any Collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure
from any other guaranty, for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
 
   (d)      the
existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that any Guarantor may have at any time against any Person, including, without
limitation, any Agent or any Lender;
 
   (e)      any
change, restructuring or termination of the corporate, limited liability company or partnership structure or existence of any Loan Party;
or
 
   (f)      any
other circumstance (other than the defense of payment, but including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence
of or reliance on any representation by the Agents or the Lenders that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge
of, any Loan Party or any other guarantor or surety.
 


139 
 


 
This ARTICLE XI shall
continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded
or must otherwise be returned by the Agents, the Lenders or any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any
Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
 
Section 11.03	     Waiver.
Each Guarantor hereby waives (i) promptness and diligence, (ii) notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect to any
of the Guaranteed Obligations and this ARTICLE XI and any requirement that the Agents or the Lenders exhaust any right or take any
action against any Loan Party or any other Person or any Collateral, (iii) any right to compel or direct any Agent or any Lender
to seek payment or recovery of any amounts owed under this ARTICLE XI from any one particular fund or source or to exhaust any right
or take any action against any other Loan Party, any other Person or any Collateral, (iv) any requirement that any Agent or any
Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or Lien on any property subject thereto or exhaust any right to take
any action against any Loan Party, any other Person or any Collateral, and (v) any other defense available to any Guarantor. Each
Guarantor agrees that the Agents and the Lenders shall have no obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Guarantor or against,
or in payment of, any or all of the Obligations. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the
financing arrangements contemplated herein and that the waiver set forth in this Section 11.03 is knowingly made in contemplation
of such benefits. Each Guarantor hereby waives any right to revoke this ARTICLE XI, and acknowledges that this ARTICLE XI is
continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.
 
Section 11.04	     Continuing
Guaranty; Assignments. This ARTICLE XI is a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the
later of the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than unasserted contingent indemnification Obligations) and the Final
Maturity Date, (b) be binding upon each Guarantor, its successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by 

thout limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (c),
any Lender may pledge, assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitments and its Loans owing to it) to any other Person to the extent otherwise permitted
hereunder, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted such Lender herein or
otherwise, in each case as provided in Section 12.07.
 


140 
 

 
Section 11.05	     Subrogation.
No Guarantor will exercise any rights that it may now or hereafter acquire against any Loan Party or any other guarantor that arise from
the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such Guarantor’s obligations under this ARTICLE XI, including, without
limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any
claim or remedy of the Agents and the Lenders against any Loan Party or any other guarantor or any Collateral, whether or not such claim,
remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive
from any Loan Party or any other guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment
or security solely on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than unasserted
contingent indemnification Obligations) shall have been paid in full and the Final Maturity Date shall have occurred. If any amount shall
be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the later of the payment in full of
the Guaranteed Obligations (other than unasserted contingent indemnification Obligations) and the Final Maturity Date, such amount shall
(A) to the extent Guaranteed Obligations are outstanding, be held in trust for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, as applicable,
and shall forthwith be paid to the Agents and the Lenders, as applicable, to be credited and applied to such Guaranteed Obligations,
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (B) promptly be returned to the party which paid such amount. If (i) any
Guarantor shall make payment to the Agents and the Lenders of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than unasserted contingent
indemnification Obligations), (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than unasserted contingent indemnification Obligations)
shall be paid in full and (iii) the Final Maturity Date shall have occurred, the Agents and the Lenders will, at such Guarantor’s
request and expense, execute and deliver to such Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty,
necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to such Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such
payment by such Guarantor.

 
Section 11.06	     Contribution.
All Guarantors desire to allocate among themselves, in a fair and equitable manner, their obligations arising under this Guaranty. 
Accordingly, in the event any payment or distribution is made on any date by a Guarantor under this Guaranty such that its Aggregate
Payments exceeds its Fair Share as of such date, such Guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from each of the other Guarantors
in an amount sufficient to cause each Guarantor’s Aggregate Payments to equal its Fair Share as of such date.
 
   (a)      “Fair
Share” means, with respect to any Guarantor as of any date of determination, an amount equal to the sum of (a) its pro
rata portion of the aggregate amount paid or distributed on or before such date by any Guarantor under this Guaranty in respect of the
Guaranteed Obligations and (b) its pro rata portion of Deficits with respect to the other Guarantors, if any, in each case subject
to its Maximum Contribution Amount (such amounts under clauses (a) or (b) in excess of the Maximum Contribution Amount with
respect to any Guarantor, “Deficits”).
 
   (b)      “Maximum
Contribution Amount” means, with respect to any Guarantor as of any date of determination, the maximum aggregate amount of
the obligations of such Guarantor under this Guaranty that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent
transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any comparable applicable provisions of state
law; provided, solely for purposes of calculating the “Maximum Contribution Amount” with respect to any Guarantor
for purposes of this Section 11.06, any assets or liabilities of such Guarantor arising by virtue of any rights to subrogation,
reimbursement or indemnification or any rights to or obligations of contribution hereunder shall not be considered as assets or liabilities
of such Guarantor.
 


141 
 

 
   (c)      “Aggregate
Payments” means, with respect to any Guarantor as of any date of determination, an amount equal to (A) the aggregate amount
of all payments and distributions made on or before such date by such Guarantor in respect of this Guaranty (including, without limitation,
in respect of this Section 11.06), minus (B) the aggregate amount of all payments received on or before such
date by such Guarantor from the other Guarantors as contributions under this Section 11.06. The amounts payable as contributions
hereunder shall be determined as of the date on which the related payment or distribution is made by the applicable Guarantor. 
The allocation among Guarantors of their obligations as set forth in this Section 11.06 shall not be construed in any way
to limit the liability of any Guarantor hereunder.  Each Guarantor is a third party beneficiary to the contribution agreement set
forth in this Section 11.06.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(A) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by an Agent, affect the rights or duties of such Agent under
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, (B) no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment,
waiver or consent hereunder, except that the Final Maturity Date of such Loan held by the Defaulting Lender may not be extended without
the consent of such Defaulting Lender, (C) [reserved], (D) for the purposes of voting on amendments, waivers and consents with
respect to the Loan Documents, except as provided in clause (B) above, the Defaulting Lenders shall be deemed not to be “Lenders”
and the Term Loans held by the Defaulting Lenders shall be deemed to be zero and (E) any amendment or modification to the Fee Letter,
or waiver of any rights or privileges thereunder, shall only require the consent of the Borrower and the Agents party thereto.
 
   (b)      Notwithstanding
anything else in this Agreement and whether or not the Borrower or the Guarantors are in bankruptcy, all Lenders will have the right
to participate their Pro Rata Share in any additional capital invested by any of the other Lenders on the same terms as any other Lender
(other than Ancillary Fees) if such new capital is (i) pari passu or senior in right of lien priority on any of the assets of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries as compared to the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Security Documents or
(ii) has a contractual right of payment that is pari passu or senior to (x) the Obligations or (y) any security or loan
received from or in exchange for the Term Loans. The offer to participate in any such transaction for a Lender will be available for
a period of at least five (5) Business Days from when such Lender has been contacted about such new capital.
 
   (c)      If
(A)(i) any action to be taken by the Lenders hereunder requires the unanimous consent, authorization, or agreement of all of the
Lenders, (ii) the Required Lenders have consented to such action and (iii) a Lender other than the Collateral Agent or Administrative
Agent, fails to give its consent, authorization, or agreement, or (B) any Lender requests reimbursement under Section 2.08
or Section 4.05 (each of the Lenders described in clauses (A) and (B), a “Holdout Lender”), then
the Borrower upon at least five (5) Business Days prior irrevocable notice to the Holdout Lender, may permanently replace the Holdout
Lender with one or more substitute Replacement Lenders reasonably acceptable to the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent, and
the Holdout Lender shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder; provided that, in the case of any replacement resulting
from a request for reimbursement described in clause (B) above, the replacement will result in a reduction in the reimbursement
requested under Section 2.08 or Section 4.05. Such notice to replace the Holdout Lender shall specify an effective
date for such replacement, which date shall not be later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date such notice is given. Prior to
the effective date of such replacement, the Holdout Lender and the Replacement Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance,
subject only to the Holdout Lender being repaid its share of the outstanding Obligations without any premium or penalty. If the Holdout
Lender shall refuse or fail to execute and deliver any such Assignment and Acceptance prior to the effective date of such replacement,
the Holdout Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance. The replacement of any Holdout Lender
shall be made in accordance with the terms of Section 12.07(b). Until such time as the Replacement Lender shall have acquired
all of the Obligations, the Commitments, and the other rights and obligations of the Holdout Lender hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents, the Holdout Lender shall remain obligated to make its Pro Rata Share of the Term Loans.

Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The rights and remedies of the Agents and
the Lenders provided herein and in the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are in addition to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies provided by law. The rights of the Agents and the Lenders under any Loan Document against any party thereto are not conditional
or contingent on any attempt by the Agents and the Lenders to exercise any of their rights under any other Loan Document against such
party or against any other Person.

so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.03

Section 12.07   Assignments
and Participations.
 
(a)           This
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Loan Party and each Agent and each Lender
and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that none of the Loan Parties may assign or transfer any of its
rights hereunder or under the other Loan Documents without the prior written consent of each Lender and the Administrative Agent and
any such assignment without the Lenders’ and the Administrative Agent’s prior written consent shall be null and void and
no Lender may assign or transfer any of its rights hereunder or under the other Loan Documents except (i) to an assignee in accordance
with the provisions of Section 12.07(b) and (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.07(i).
 
(b)           Each
Lender may with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, assign to (i) one or more Eligible Transferees and (ii) if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, one or more Ineligible Institutions, in each case, all or a portion of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement with respect to all or a portion of its Term Loan Commitment and any portion of the Term Loans made
by it; provided, however, that (i) any such assignment under clause (i) above shall require the prior consent of the
Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (and shall be deemed to have been given in the event
Borrower has not responded within five (5) Business Days of request for such consent) nor shall it be required during the existence
of an Event of Default), (ii) such assignment is in an amount which is at least $500,000 or a multiple of $250,000 in excess thereof
(or the remainder of such Lender’s Commitment) (except such minimum amount shall not apply to an assignment by a Lender to (x) a
Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or a Related Fund of such Lender or (y) a group of new Lenders, each of whom is an Affiliate
or Related Fund of each other to the extent the aggregate amount to be assigned to all such new Lenders is at least $500,000 or a multiple
of $250,000 in excess thereof), (iii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to each Agent, an Assignment
and Acceptance, and such parties shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, a processing
and recordation fee of $3,500 (provided that the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, may elect to waive or reduce such processing
and recordation fee), (iv) any such assignment shall require the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, that no written consent of the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or the
Borrower shall be required (1) in connection with any assignment by a Lender to a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or a Related
Fund of such Lender or (2) if such assignment is in connection with any merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, or other disposition
of all or any substantial portion of the business or loan portfolio of such Lender and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender,
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any tax forms required by Section 2.08 and an Administrative Questionnaire. Upon
such execution, delivery and acceptance, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance and recordation
in the Register, (A) the assignee thereunder shall become a “Lender” hereunder and, in addition to the rights and obligations
hereunder held by it immediately prior to such effective date, have the rights and obligations hereunder that have been assigned to it
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and (B) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender’s
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) Notwithstanding the foregoi

ormation it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance;
(iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the assigning Lender, any Agent or any Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking
action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (v) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agents to take such action
as agents on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Agents

agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents are required to be performed by it as a Lender.
 
(d)           The
Administrative Agent shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain, or cause to be maintained
at one of its offices in the United States, a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register (the
 “Register”) for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitments of, and the principal
amount of the Term Loans (and stated interest thereon) (the “Registered Loans”) owing to each Lender from time to
time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agents
and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.
The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
prior notice. The Register is intended to cause the Registered Loans to be in registered form within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 5f.103-1(c) and within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.
 


149 
 

 
(e)           Upon
receipt by the Administrative Agent of a completed Assignment and Acceptance and the processing and recordation fee (if applicable) and
other items required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 12.07(b), and subject to any consent
required from the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 12.07(b) (which consent of the Administrative Agent must
be evidenced by the Administrative Agent’s execution of an acceptance to such Assignment and Acceptance), the Administrative Agent
shall accept such assignment, record the information contained therein in the Register.
 
(f)           A
Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be assigned or sold in whole or in part only by registration
of such assignment or sale on the Register (and each registered note shall expressly so provide). Any assignment or sale of all or part
of such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by registration of such assignment
or sale on the Register. Prior to the registration of assignment or sale of any Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing
the same), the Agents shall treat the Person in whose name such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same)
is registered on the Register as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving all payments thereon, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.
 
(g)           In
the event that any Lender sells participations in a Registered Loan, such Lender shall, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent
on behalf of the Borrower, maintain, or cause to be maintained, a register, on which it enters the name of all participants in the Registered
Loans held by it and the principal amount (and stated interest thereon) of the portion of the Registered Loan that is the subject of
the participation (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose
all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant’s
interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent
that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form
under Treasury Regulations Section 5f.103-1(c) or proposed Section 1.163-5(b) of the United States Treasury Regulations
(or, in each case, any amended or successor version). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error,
and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all
purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity
as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. A Registered Loan (and the registered note,
if any, evidencing the same) may be participated in whole or in part only by registration of such participation on the Participant Register
(and each registered note shall expressly so provide). Any participation of such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing
the same) may be effected only by the registration of such participation on the Participant Register. The Participant Register shall
be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 


150 
 

 
(h)           Any
Non-U.S. Lender who purchases or is assigned or participates in any portion of such Registered Loan shall comply with Section 2.08(d).
 
(i)            Each
Lender may sell participations to (x) one or more Eligible Transferees and (y) if an Event of Default under Sections 9.01(a),
(f) or (g) has occurred and is continuing, one or more Ineligible Institutions, in each case, in or to all or a portion of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its
Commitments and the Term Loans made by it); provided, that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement (including
without limitation, its Commitments hereunder) and the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged and that any such participant shall
not be entitled to receive any greater payment or benefit hereunder than such Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect
to the participation sold to such participant unless the sale of such participation is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent;
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and the Borrower,
the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights
and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; and (iii) a participant shall not be entitled to require such
Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder except (A) action directly effecting an extension of the maturity dates or decrease
in the principal amount of the Term Loans, (B) action directly effecting an extension of the due dates or a decrease in the rate
of interest payable on the Term Loans or the fees payable under this Agreement, or (C) actions directly effecting a release of all
or a substantial portion of the Collateral or any Loan Party (except as set forth in Section 10.08 of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document). The Loan Parties agree that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.08, 2.09,
2.10, 2.11 and 2.12 subject to the obligations and limitations set forth thereunder with respect to its participation
in any 


MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

such Lender to the Borrower). All sums paid or agreed to be paid to any Agent or any Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of
sums due hereunder shall, to the extent permitted by law applicable to such Agent or such Lender, be amortized, prorated, allocated and
spread throughout the full term of the Term Loans until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of any Term
Loans hereunder does not exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law. If at any time and from time to time (x) the
amount of interest payable to any Agent or any Lender on any date shall be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Agent
or such Lender pursuant to this Section 12.19 and (y) in respect of any subsequent interest computation period the amount
of interest otherwise payable to such Agent or such Lender would be less than the amount of interest payable to such Agent or such Lender
computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Agent or such Lender, then the amount of interest payable to such Agent or such
Lender in respect of such subsequent interest computation period shall continue to be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable
to such Agent or such Lender until the total amount of interest payable to such Agent or such Lender shall equal the total amount of
interest which would have been payable to such Agent or such Lender if the total amount of interest had been computed without giving
effect to this Section 12.19.
 
For purposes of this Section 12.19,
the term “applicable law” shall mean that law in effect from time to time and applicable to the loan transaction between
the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Agents and the Lenders, on the other, that lawfully permits the charging and collection of the
highest permissible, lawful non-usurious rate of interest on such loan transaction and this Agreement, including laws of the State of
New York and, to the extent controlling, laws of the United States of America.
 
The right to accelerate the
maturity of the Obligations does not include the right to accelerate any interest that has not accrued as of the date of acceleration.

Section 12.20   Confidentiality.
Each Agent and each Lender agrees (on behalf of itself and each of its Related Parties) to use reasonable precautions to keep confidential,
in accordance with its customary procedures for handling confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe and sound
practices of comparable banks or commercial finance companies, any non-public information supplied to it by the Loan Parties pursuant
to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents which is identified in writing by the Loan Part

or participant
(or prospective assignee or participant) or any party to a Securitization so long as such assignee or participant (or prospective assignee
or participant) or party to a Securitization agrees, in writing, to be bound by or is otherwise subject to customary confidentiality
obligations (including, without limitation, confidentiality provisions similar in substance to this Section 12.20); (iv) to
the extent required by any Requirement of Law or judicial process or as otherwise requested by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over such Person; (v) (x) to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization, any examiner,
auditor or accountant or any nationally recognized rating agency or (y) otherwise to the extent consisting of general portfolio
information that does not identify Loan Parties; provided, unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each
Agent and each Lender shall make reasonable efforts to notify the Borrower of any request by any Governmental Authority or representative
thereof; (vi) in connection with any litigation to which any Agent or any Lender is a party; (vii) in connection with the exercise
of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, in each case, solely to the extent necessary in connection therewith; or (viii) with
the consent of the Borrower. In addition, the Agents and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about
this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to any Agent or any
Lender in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Commitments.
 
Section 12.21   Public
Disclosure. Each Loan Party agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates will now or in the future issue any press release or
other public disclosure using the name of an Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates or referring to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of such Agent or such Lender, except to the extent that such Loan Party or
such Affiliate is required by any Requirement of Law (in which event, such Loan Party or such Affiliate will consult with such Agent
or such Lender before issuing such press release or other public disclosure; provided, that any failure of such Loan party or
such Affiliate to consult with such Agent or such Lender shall not result in an Event of Default hereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything contained herein to the contrary, the Borrower or any parent company of the Borrower may include a summary of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document in, and file copies thereof as exhibits to,  any registration statement that it submits or files under
the Securities Act, or filings it makes or furnishes under the Exchange Act.  Each Loan Party hereby authorizes each Agent and each
Lender, after consultation with the Borrower, to advertise the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to make
reasonably appropriate announcements of the financial arrangements entered into among the parties hereto, as such Agent or such Lender
shall deem reasonably appropriate, including, without limitation, announcements commonly known as tombstones, in such trade publications,
business journals, newspapers of general circulation and to such selected parties as such Agent or such Lender shall deem reasonably
appropriate.
 


158 
 

 
Section 12.22   Integration.
This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, reflects the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not be contradicted or qualified by any other agreement, oral or written, before the date hereof.
 
Section 12.23   USA
PATRIOT Act. Each Lender that is subject to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act and each Agent hereby notifies the Borrower that
pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower,
which information includes the name and address of each such entity and other information that will allow such Lender or Agent to identify
the Borrower in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act. Each Loan Party agrees to take such action and execute, acknowledge and deliver
at its sole cost and expense, such instruments and documents as any Lender may reasonably require from time to time in order to enable
such Lender to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act.
 
Section 12.24   Released
Loan Party. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Loan Party (the “Released Loan Party”) shall be
automatically released from its obligations under this Agreement in the event that all or any portion of the Equity Interests of the
Released Loan Party shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed as permitted by Section 7.02(c), and the parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that each reference to a “Loan Party” or the “Loan Parties” in this Agreement shall not
include such Released Loan Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the proceeds of any such sale, transfer or disposition shall continue
to be subject to the Collateral Agent’s Lien pursuant to the Loan Documents.
 
Section 12.25   Electronic
Signatures. This Agreement, any other Loan Document and any document, amendment, approval, consent, information, notice, certificate,
request, statement, disclosure or authorization related to this Agreement or any other Loan Document (each, for purposes of this Section 12.25,
a “Specified Communication”), including Specified Communications required to be in writing, may be in the form of
an Electronic Record and may be executed using Electronic Signatures. Each of the Loan Parties agrees that any Electronic Signature on
or associated with any Specified Communication shall be valid and binding each of the Loan Parties to the same extent as a manual, original
signature, and that any Specified Communication entered into by Electronic Signature, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation
of each of the Loan Parties enforceable against such in accordance with the terms thereof to the same extent as if a manually executed
original signature was delivered. Any Specified Communication may be executed in as many counterparts as necessary or convenient, including
both paper and electronic counterparts, but all such counterparts are one and the same Specified Communication. For the avoidance of
doubt, the authorization under this paragraph may include, without limitation, use or acceptance by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent and each of the Lenders of a manually signed paper Specified Communication which has been converted into electronic form (such
as scanned into PDF format), or an electronically signed Specified Communication converted into another format, for transmission, delivery
and/or retention. The Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each of the Lenders may, at its option, create one or more copies
of any Specified Communication in the form of an imaged Electronic Record (“Electronic Copy”), which shall be deemed created
in the ordinary course of the such Person’s business, and destroy the original paper document. All Specified Communications in
the form of an Electronic Record, including an Electronic Copy, shall be considered an original for all purposes, and shall have the
same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither
the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent is under any obligation to accept an Electronic Signature in any form or in any format
unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided, further,
that without limiting the foregoing, (a) to the extent the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent has agreed to accept such Electronic
Signature, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each of the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on any such Electronic Signature
purportedly given by or on behalf of any Loan Party without further verification and (b) upon the request of the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart.
For purposes hereof, “Electronic Record” and “Electronic Signature” shall have the meanings assigned to them,
respectively, by 15 USC §7006, as it may be amended from time to time.
 


159 
 

 
Section 12.26   Judgment
Currency.
 
If, for the purposes of obtaining
judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency,
the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase
the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the
Borrower in respect of any such sum due from them to the Agents or the Lenders hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding
any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than Dollars (the “Agreement Currency”),
be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so
due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency
with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Secured Parties
from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to
indemnify the Secured Parties or the Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss.
