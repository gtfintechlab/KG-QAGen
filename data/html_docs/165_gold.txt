ARTICLE II.  THE
COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS  2.01 Committed Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender
severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a Committed Loan) to the Company in Dollars or in one or more Alternative Currencies from time to time, on any Business Day during the Availability Period applicable to such Lender,
in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such Lenders Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any Committed Borrowing, (i) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the
Aggregate Commitments, and (ii) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender shall not exceed such Lenders Commitment. Within the limits of each Lenders Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Company
may borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay under Section 2.04, and reborrow under this Section 2.01. Committed Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as
further provided herein.  2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Committed
Loans.  (a) Each Committed Borrowing, each conversion of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be made upon the Companys irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by (A) telephone or (B) a Committed Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed
promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Committed Loan Notice. Each such Committed Loan Notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any
Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars or of any conversion of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars to Base Rate Loans, (ii) four Business Days prior to the requested date of any
Borrowing or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, and (iii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans; provided, however, that if the Company wishes to request Eurocurrency
Rate Loans having an Interest Period other than one, two, three or six months in duration as provided in the definition of Interest Period, the applicable notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m.
(i) four Business Days prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, or (ii) five Business Days prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or
continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, whereupon the 
  22 



Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Lenders of such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is acceptable to all of them. Not later than 11:00 a.m., (i) three
Business Days before the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, or (ii) four Business Days prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company (which notice may be by telephone) whether or not the requested Interest Period has been consented to by all the Lenders. Each Borrowing
of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of US$25,000,000 or a whole multiple of US$5,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in Section 2.03(c), each Committed Borrowing of or
conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of US$10,000,000 or a whole multiple of US$1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Committed Loan Notice shall specify (i) whether the Company is requesting a Committed Borrowing, a
conversion of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the
principal amount of Committed Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Committed Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Committed Loans are to be converted, (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period
with respect thereto and (vi) the currency of the Committed Loans to be borrowed. If the Company fails to specify a currency in a Committed Loan Notice requesting a Borrowing, then the Committed Loans so requested shall be made in Dollars. If
the Company fails to specify a Type of Committed Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or if the Company fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Committed Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base
Rate Loans; provided, however, that in the case of a failure to timely request a continuation of Committed Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, such Loans shall be continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans in their original
currency with an Interest Period of one month. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If the Company
requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month. No Committed Loan may
be converted into or continued as a Committed Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Committed Loan and reborrowed in the other currency. 
(b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount (and currency) of
its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Committed Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Company, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base
Rate Loans or continuation of Committed Loans denominated in a currency other than Dollars, in each case as described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Committed Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Committed Loan
available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agents Office for the applicable currency not later than 1:00 p.m., in the case of any Committed Loan denominated in Dollars, and not later than the Applicable Time
specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of any Committed Loan in an Alternative Currency, in each case on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set

  23 



forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so
received available to the Company in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Company on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds,
in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Company; provided, however, that if, on the date the Committed Loan Notice with respect to such Borrowing
denominated in Dollars is given by the Company, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and, second, shall be made available to the Company
as provided above.  (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day
of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Loan. During the existence of an Event of Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether denominated in Dollars or any Alternative Currency)
without the consent of the Required Lenders, and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the then outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency be prepaid, or redenominated into Dollars in the amount of the
Dollar Equivalent thereof, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto.  (d) The Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurocurrency Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. 
(e) After giving effect to all Committed Borrowings, all conversions of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of
Committed Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in effect with respect to Committed Loans.  (f)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Lender may exchange, continue or rollover all of the portion of its Loans in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms
of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Company, the Administrative Agent, and such Lender.  2.03

conditions hereof, the Companys ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Company may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have
been drawn upon and reimbursed.  (ii) No L/C Issuer shall issue any Letter of Credit, if:

Lenders have approved such expiry date.  (iii) No L/C Issuer shall be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit
if:  (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or
restrain such L/C Issuer from issuing the Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to such L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such L/C Issuer shall
prohibit, or request that such L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or the Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such L/C Issuer with respect to the Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital
requirement (for which such L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the date of this Agreement, or shall impose upon such L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the date of this
Agreement and which such L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;  (B) the issuance of the Letter of Credit would
violate one or more policies of such L/C Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally;  (C) except as otherwise agreed
by the Administrative Agent and such L/C Issuer, the Letter of Credit is in an initial stated amount less than US$500,000; 
(D) except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and such L/C Issuer, the Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a
currency other than Dollars or an Alternative Currency; or  (E) such L/C Issuer does not as of the issuance date of the
requested Letter of Credit issue Letters of Credit in the requested currency;  (F) any Lender is at that time a Defaulting
Lender, unless such L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to such L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with the Company or such Defaulting Lender to eliminate such L/C Issuers actual
or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other
L/C Obligations as to which such L/C Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion. 
(iv) No L/C Issuer shall amend any Letter of Credit if such L/C Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue the Letter
of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof. 
  25 


(v) No L/C Issuer shall be under any obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if
(A) such L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue the Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to the Letter of
Credit.  (vi) Each L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the
documents associated therewith, and each L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such L/C Issuer in
connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term Administrative Agent as used in Article IX included such L/C Issuer
with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to such L/C Issuer.  (b) Procedures
for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit.  (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be
issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Company delivered to the applicable L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by an
Authorized Officer of the Company. Such Letter of Credit Application may be sent by facsimile, by United States mail, by overnight courier, by electronic transmission using the system provided by the applicable L/C Issuer, by personal delivery or by
any other means acceptable to such L/C Issuer. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the applicable L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. (noon) at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as
the Administrative Agent and the applicable L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a
Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day);
(B) the amount and currency thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full
text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit; and (H) such other matters as such L/C Issuer may reasonably require. In the case
of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the
proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as such L/C Issuer may require. Additionally, the Company shall furnish to the applicable L/C Issuer
and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as such L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may reasonably require. 
(ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the applicable L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative
Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Company and, if not, such L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the applicable
L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Company, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable
conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Company (or the applicable
Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with such L/C Issuers usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be
deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the applicable L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lenders Applicable Percentage times the
amount of such Letter of Credit. 
  26 


(iii) If the Company so requests in any Letter of Credit Application, the
applicable L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit
must permit such L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Non-Extension Notice Date) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the applicable L/C Issuer, the Company shall not be
required to make a specific request to such L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable L/C Issuer to permit the
extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that no L/C Issuer shall permit any such extension if (A) such L/C Issuer has determined that
it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of
Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension
Notice Date from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension and directing such L/C Issuer not to permit such extension. 
(iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with
respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.

(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the
applicable L/C Issuer shall notify the Company and the Administrative Agent thereof. In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Company shall reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer in such Alternative Currency, unless
(A) such L/C Issuer (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (B) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the Company shall have notified such L/C
Issuer promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that the Company will reimburse such L/C Issuer in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the
applicable L/C Issuer shall notify the Company of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. If the Company is notified prior to 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the applicable L/C Issuer
under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, then no later than 1:00 p.m. on such Business Day or the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by the applicable L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, or the
Applicable Time on the date of any payment by the applicable L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (or if notified after such time, then no later than 11:00 a.m. on the next succeeding Business Day or the
Applicable Time on the date of any payment by the applicable L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency) (each such date, an Honor Date), the Company shall reimburse such L/C Issuer through the
Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency. In the event that (A) a drawing denominated in an Alternative Currency is to be reimbursed in Dollars pursuant to the second sentence in this
Section 2.03(c)(i) and (B) the Dollar amount paid by the Company, whether on or after the Honor Date, shall not be adequate on the date of that payment to purchase in accordance with normal banking procedures a sum denominated in the
Alternative Currency equal to the drawing, the Company agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to indemnify such L/C Issuer for the loss resulting from its inability on that date to purchase the Alternative Currency in the full amount of
the drawing. If the Company fails to timely reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer on the Honor Date, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the
amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) (the Unreimbursed Amount), and the amount of such Lenders Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, the
Company shall be deemed to have requested a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard

to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate
Commitments. Any notice given by an L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of
such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.  (ii) Each Lender
shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer, in Dollars, at the
Administrative Agents Office for Dollar-denominated payments in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Dollar Equivalent of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the
Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Company in such amount. The Administrative
Agent shall remit the funds so received to the applicable L/C Issuer in Dollars.  (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed
Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Company shall be deemed to have incurred from
the applicable L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such
event, each Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and
shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03. 
(iv) Until each Lender funds its Committed Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to
reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of such L/C Issuer. 
(v) Each Lenders obligation to make Committed Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse an L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under
Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Lender may have against such L/C Issuer, the Company, any Subsidiary or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing. No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Company to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any Letter of
Credit, together with interest as provided herein.  (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent
for the account of an L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), then,
without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, such L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment
is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged
by such L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Committed Loan included in the relevant Committed Borrowing or L/C
Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of a L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. 
  28 


(d) Repayment of Participations. 
(i) At any time after an L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such
Lenders L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or
interest thereon (whether directly from the Company or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in
Dollars and in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.  (ii) If any payment received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of an L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any
settlement entered into by such L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from
the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of
the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.  (e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Company to reimburse the
applicable L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
under all circumstances, including the following:  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit,
this Agreement, or any other Loan Document;  (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right
that the Company or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), such L/C Issuer or any other Person,
whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
(iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 
(iv) waiver by such L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for such L/C Issuers protection and not the protection of
the Company or any waiver by such L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice the Company;  (v) honor of a
demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires that demand be in the form of a draft; 
(vi) any payment made by such L/C Issuer in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date specified as the
expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under, such Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the Uniform Commercial Code or the ISP, as applicable; 
(vii) any payment by such L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by such L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy,
debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such
Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; 
  29 


(viii) any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability
of the relevant Alternative Currency to the Company or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally; or 
(ix) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other
circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Company or any Subsidiary.  The Company shall
promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Companys instructions or other irregularity, the Company will promptly notify the
applicable L/C Issuer. Unless there was bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or a material breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the applicable L/C Issuer as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and
nonappealable judgment, the Company shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the applicable L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
(f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Company agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, no L/C Issuer shall
have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the
Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of an L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for
(i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence, willful
misconduct or a material breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Company
hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Companys
pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant
or assignee of an L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (ix) of Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Company may have a claim against an L/C Issuer, and an L/C Issuer may be liable to the Company, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential, special, indirect, punitive or
exemplary, damages suffered by the Company which the Company proves were caused by such L/C Issuers bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or material breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or such L/C Issuers
willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, an L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and no L/C Issuer shall be responsible for the
validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective
for any reason. An L/C 
  30 



Issuer may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) message
or overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary.  (g) Applicability of ISP;
Limitation of Liability. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable L/C Issuer and the Company when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no L/C
Issuer shall be responsible to the Company for, and such L/C Issuers rights and remedies against the Company shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of such L/C Issuer required or permitted under any Law, order, or practice that is
required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where such L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or in the decisions, opinions,
practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice,
whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such Law or practice.  (h) Letter of Credit Fees. The Company shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.16, with its Applicable Percentage, in Dollars, a Letter of Credit fee (the Letter of Credit
Fee) for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the Dollar Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under
any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.07. Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) due and payable on the first Business Day of each March, June, September
and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. If there is any change
in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in
effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate. 
(i) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuers. The Company shall pay directly to the applicable L/C
Issuer for its own account, in Dollars, a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by it, at the rate per annum specified in the Fee Letter or as otherwise agreed between the Company and the applicable L/C Issuer, computed on the
Dollar Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fee shall be due and payable on the tenth Business Day of each March, June, September and December in respect of
the most recently-ended quarterly period (or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment) or, if later, the fifth Business Day after the Company has received an invoice therefor, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance
of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date applicable to such L/C Issuer and thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of

  31 



Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.07. In addition, the Company shall pay directly to the applicable L/C Issuer for its own account, in Dollars, the
customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit issued by it as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and
charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.  (j) Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict
between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control.  (k) Letter of Credit Reports. Each
applicable L/C Issuer shall furnish (A) to the Administrative Agent (with a copy to the Company) on the fifth Business Day of each month a written report in substantially the form of Exhibit M (or any other form approved by the Administrative
Agent) summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer during the preceding month and drawings during such month under all Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer, (B) to the Administrative Agent
(with a copy to the Company) on the first Business Day of each calendar quarter a written report setting forth the actual daily aggregate available amount of Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer during the preceding calendar quarter of all
Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer and (C) prompt notice to the Administrative Agent of each expiration, cancellation or renewal of a Letter of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer hereunder. 
(l) Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of
any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the Company shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit. The Company hereby acknowledges that the issuance of
Letters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Company, and that the Companys business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries. 
2.04 Prepayments. (a) The Company may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily
prepay Committed Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00
p.m. (noon) (A) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, (B) four Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies,
and (C) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars shall be in a principal amount of US$25,000,000 or a whole multiple of US$5,000,000 in excess thereof;
(iii) any prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies shall be in a minimum principal amount of US$25,000,000 or a whole multiple of US$5,000,000 in excess thereof; (iv) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans
shall be in a principal amount of US$5,000,000 or a whole multiple of US$1,000,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding; and (v) any such notice may be conditioned on the
effectiveness of other financing arrangements or one or more other transactions. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Committed Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurocurrency Rate Loans are to be
prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by
the Company, the Company shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, subject to the occurrence of any condition(s) specified therein. Any prepayment of a
Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Subject to Section 2.16, each such
prepayment shall be applied to the Committed Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages.  (b) If the
Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time that the Total Outstandings, less Cash Collateral, at such time exceed an amount equal to 105% of the Aggregate Commitments then in effect, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such
notice, the Company shall prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount at least equal to such excess over the Aggregate Commitment; provided, however, that, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.15(a), the Company shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) unless after the prepayment in full of the Loans the Total Outstandings
exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect. 
  32 


2.05 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The Company may,
upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later
than 12:00 p.m. (noon) three Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of US$25,000,000 or any whole multiple of US$5,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) any
such notice may be conditioned on the effectiveness of other financing arrangements or one or more other transactions, (iv) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any
concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and (v) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate
Commitments, such sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments. The amount of any such
Aggregate Commitment reduction shall not be applied to the Letter of Credit Sublimit unless otherwise specified by the Company. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Applicable
Percentage. All fees accrued with respect thereto until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. 
2.06 Repayment of Loans. The Company shall repay to each Lender on the Termination Date applicable to such Lender the
aggregate principal amount of Committed Loans made by such Lender outstanding on such date.  2.07 Interest. 
(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate and (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.  (b) (i) If any
amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at
all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.  (ii) If any amount (other than
principal of any Loan) payable by the Company under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders,
such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. 
(iii) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon
demand. 
  33 


(c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date
applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any
Debtor Relief Law.  (d) For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), (i) whenever a rate of interest or fee rate hereunder is
calculated on the basis of a year (the deemed year) that contains fewer days than the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation, such rate of interest or fee rate shall be expressed as a yearly rate by multiplying such
rate of interest or fee rate by the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation and dividing it by the number of days in the deemed year, (ii) the principle of deemed reinvestment of interest shall not apply to any interest
calculation hereunder and (iii) the rates of interest stipulated herein are intended to be nominal rates and not effective rates or yields. 
2.08 Fees. In addition to certain fees described in subsections (h) and (i) of
Section 2.03:  (a) Facility Fee. The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a facility fee ( the Facility Fee) in Dollars equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Commitments (or, if the Aggregate
Commitments have terminated, on the Outstanding Amount of all Committed Loans and L/C Obligations), regardless of usage, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.16. The Facility Fee shall accrue at all times during
the Availability Period (and thereafter so long as any Committed Loans or L/C Obligations remain outstanding), including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly
in arrears on the first Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period (and, if applicable, thereafter on demand). The
Facility Fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such
quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.  (b) Other Fees. The Company shall pay to the respective Arrangers and the
Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts, in Dollars, fees in the amounts and at the times separately agreed in writing. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 
(i) The Company shall pay to the Lenders, in Dollars, such fees, if any, as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing
in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 
2.09 Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base
Rate Loans determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid 
  34 



than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year), or, in the case of interest in respect of Committed Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to
which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the
Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.11(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of
an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  2.10 Evidence of
Debt. (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Company and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall
not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Company hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and
records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender to the Company made through the Administrative Agent,
the Company shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Committed Loan Note, which shall evidence such Lenders Loans to the Company in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to
a Committed Loan Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
(b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a) above, each Lender and the Administrative Agent
shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the
Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
2.11 Payments Generally; Administrative Agents Clawback. (a) General. All
payments to be made by the Company shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and
interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments by the Company hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative
Agents Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Company hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans
denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agents Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same
Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be
made in the United States. If, for any reason, the Company is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, the Company shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative
Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lenders
Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative
Currency, shall, at the option of the Administrative Agent, be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Company shall come due on a day other
than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. 
  35 


(b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Committed Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 p.m. (noon) on the date of such Committed
Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Committed Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender
and the Company severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Company to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in
connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Company, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Company and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an
overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Company the amount of such interest paid by the Company for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then
the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Committed Loan included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment by the Company shall be without prejudice to any claim the Company may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such
payment to the Administrative Agent.  (ii) Payments by the Company; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any L/C Issuer hereunder that the Company will not make such payment, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Company has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuers, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if
the Company has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such L/C
Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. 
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Company with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error.  (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent
funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to the Company as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Company by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable
Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

  36 


(d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make
Committed Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan, to fund any such participation
or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of
any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c). 
(e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or
manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
2.12 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim
or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Committed Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate
amount of such Committed Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent
of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such
payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that: 
(i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in
Section 2.15, or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Committed Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations to any assignee or
participant, other than an assignment to the Company or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).  The Company
consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Company rights of setoff and counterclaim
with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Company in the amount of such participation. 
2.13 Extension of Termination Date. (a) Requests for Extension. The Company may, by notice to the
Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders) not earlier than 90 days and not later than 45 days prior to any anniversary of the Closing Date (an Anniversary Date), request that each Lender extend such
Lenders Termination Date for an additional period of one or two years from the then effective Termination Date; provided that the requested extension shall not result in a then remaining tenor of longer than five years from such
Anniversary Date.  (b) Lender Elections to Extend. Each Lender, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by notice to
the Administrative Agent given not later than the date (the Notice 
  37 



Date) that is 15 days after receipt from the Administrative Agent of the extension request, advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension (and
each Lender that determines not to so extend its Termination Date (a Non-Extending Lender) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in
any event no later than the Notice Date), and any Lender that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender. The election of any Lender
to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree.  (c) Notification by Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Company of each Lenders determination under this Section no later than the date 15 days prior to the applicable Anniversary Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business
Day).  (d) Additional Commitment Lenders. The Company shall have the right to replace each
Non-Extending Lender with, and add as Lenders under this Agreement in place thereof, one or more Eligible Assignees (each, an Additional Commitment Lender) as provided in
Section 10.12; provided that each of such Additional Commitment Lenders shall enter into an Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which such Additional Commitment Lender shall, effective as of the applicable
Anniversary Date, undertake a Commitment (and, if any such Additional Commitment Lender is already a Lender, its Commitment shall be in addition to such Lenders Commitment hereunder on such date). 
(e) Minimum Extension Requirement. If (and only if) the total of the Commitments of the Lenders that have agreed so to extend their
Termination Date (each, an Extending Lender) and the additional Commitments of the Additional Commitment Lenders shall be more than 50% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the applicable
Anniversary Date, then, effective as of the applicable Anniversary Date, the Termination Date of each Extending Lender and of each Additional Commitment Lender shall be extended to the date falling one or two years (as specified in the applicable
request for extension) after the then effective Termination Date of such Lender (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Termination Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Lender
(if not already) shall thereupon become a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement.  (f) Conditions to Effectiveness of
Extensions. As a condition precedent to such extension, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate dated as of the applicable Anniversary Date signed by an Authorized Officer of the Company (i) certifying and
attaching the resolutions adopted by the Company approving or consenting to such extension and (ii) certifying that, immediately before and after giving effect to such extension, the applicable conditions precedent set forth in
Section 4.03 have been satisfied. In addition, on the Termination Date of each Non-Extending Lender, the Company shall prepay any Committed Loans outstanding on such date (and pay any
additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to the extent necessary to keep outstanding Committed Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages of the respective Lenders effective as of such date. 
(g) Conflicting Provisions. This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.12 or 10.01 to
the contrary. 
  38 


2.14 Increase in Commitments. 
(a) Request for Increase. Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, the Company may from time to time,
request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments to an amount not exceeding US$1,750,000,000; provided that any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of US$25,000,000. 
(b) Additional Lenders. Subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuers (not to be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed), to effectuate any such increase the Company may invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender
invited to participate in such increase shall notify the Administrative Agent whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if it has not responding within the requested time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its
Commitment.  (c) Effective Date and Allocations. If the Aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, the
Administrative Agent and the Company shall determine the effective date (the Increase Effective Date) and the final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of the
final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date.  (d) Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase. As a condition
precedent to any such increase, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of the Company dated as of the Increase Effective Date signed by an Authorized Officer of the Company (x) certifying and attaching the
resolutions adopted by the Company approving or consenting to such increase, and (y) certifying that, immediately before and after giving effect to such increase, the applicable conditions precedent set forth in
Section 4.03 have been satisfied. The Company shall prepay any Committed Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to the
extent necessary to keep the outstanding Committed Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments under this Section. 
(e) Conflicting Provisions. This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.12 or 10.01 to
the contrary.  2.15 Cash Collateral. 
(a) Certain Credit Support Events. If (i) any L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of
Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing that has not been reimbursed, (ii) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, (iii) the Company shall be required to provide
Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 8.02, or (iv) there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, the Company shall immediately (in the case of clause (iii) above) or within three Business Days (in all
other cases) following any request by the Administrative Agent or the applicable L/C Issuer, provide Cash Collateral in an amount not less than the applicable Minimum Collateral Amount (determined in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to
clause (iv) above, after giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). Additionally, if the Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time
that the Outstanding 
  39 



Amount of all L/C Obligations at such time, less Cash Collateral therefor, exceeds 105% of the Letter of Credit Sublimit then in effect, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such
notice, the Company shall provide Cash Collateral for the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations in an amount not less than the amount by which the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit. 
(b) Grant of Security Interest. The Company, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants
to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all
balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to
Section 2.15(c). If at any time the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuers as herein provided,
or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Company will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount
sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank
of America. The Company shall pay on demand therefor from time to time all reasonable and customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in connection with the maintenance and disbursement of Cash Collateral. 
(c) Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this
Section 2.15 or Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.16 or 8.02 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, obligations to
fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such
property as may otherwise be provided for herein.  (d) Release. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to
reduce Fronting Exposure or to secure other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender
status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 10.06(b)(vi))) or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuers that there exists excess Cash
Collateral; provided, however, the Person providing Cash Collateral and the applicable L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other
obligations.  2.16 Defaulting Lenders. 
(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then,
until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:  (i) Waivers
and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and
Section 10.01. 
  40 


(ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees
or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent
from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting
Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuers hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure
with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.15; fourth, as the Company may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has
failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Company, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order
to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender
with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.15; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or the L/C Issuers as a result of any judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or any L/C Issuer against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default exists, to the
payment of any amounts owing to the Company as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Company against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this
Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of
which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied
or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C
Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder without giving effect to
Section 2.16(a)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this
Section 2.16(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
(iii) Certain Fees. 
(A) Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive fees payable under Sections 2.08(a) for any period during
which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to extent allocable to the sum of (1) the Outstanding Amount of the Committed Loans funded by it, and (2) its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has
provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.15.  (B) Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled
to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to
Section 2.15.  (C) With respect to any fee payable under Section 2.08(a) or any Letter of
Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, the Company shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise
payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lenders participation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause

  41 



(iv) below, (y) pay to the applicable L/C Issuer the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuers Fronting
Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.  (iv)
Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders participation in L/C Obligations shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting
Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders Commitment. Subject to Section 10.20, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a
waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation.  (v) Cash
Collateral. If the reallocation described in clause (a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Company shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable
Law, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.15. 
(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Company, the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuers agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a
Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash
Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Committed Loans and
funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender
will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Company while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided,
further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that
Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.  2.17 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Credit Extensions shall be
available (and the Company agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely for general corporate purposes not in contravention in any material respect of any Law or of any Loan Document. 
2.18 Bid Option. 
(a) Bid Option; Repayment and Effect of Bid Absolute Rate Loans. (i) In addition to Committed Loans pursuant to
Section 2.01, but subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (including, without limitation, the limitation set forth in Section 2.01 as to the maximum aggregate principal
amount of all outstanding Loans hereunder), the Company may, as set forth in this Section 2.18(a), request the Lenders, prior to the latest Termination Date, to make offers to make Bid Absolute Rate Loans to the Company.
Each Lender may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers and the Company may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers in the manner set forth in this Section 2.18. Bid Absolute Rate Loans shall be
evidenced by the Bid Notes at the request of such Lender providing such Bid Absolute Rate Loans. Each Bid Absolute Rate Loan shall be repaid in full by the Company on the last day of the Bid Interest Period applicable thereto. 
(ii) Any Lender may offer to make Bid Absolute Rate Loans in excess of its Commitment but such Loans will not relieve the
Lender of its obligation to fund its Applicable Percentage share of Committed Loans. 
  42 


(b) Bid Quote Request. When the Company wishes to request offers to make Bid Absolute Rate
Loans under this Section 2.18, the Company shall submit to the Administrative Agent a Bid Quote Request so as to be received no later than 10:00 a.m. at least one Business Day prior to the borrowing date proposed
therein, specifying:  (i) the proposed borrowing date for the proposed Bid Absolute Rate Loans; 
(ii) the aggregate principal amount of such Bid Absolute Rate Loans; and 
(iii) the Bid Interest Period applicable thereto (which must end on or prior to the latest Termination Date). 
The Company may request offers to make Bid Absolute Rate Loans for more than one Bid Interest Period. No Bid Quote Request shall be given
within five Business Days (or upon reasonable prior notice to the Lenders, such lesser number of days as the Company and the Administrative Agent may agree) of any other Bid Quote Request. Each Bid Quote Request shall be in a minimum amount of
US$5,000,000 or a larger multiple of US$1,000,000; provided that upon giving effect to such Bid Absolute Rate Loans, the then aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Loans shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect. 
(c) Invitation for Bid Quotes. Promptly upon receipt of a Bid Quote Request, the Administrative Agent shall send to each of the Lenders
an Invitation for Bid Quotes which shall constitute an invitation by the Company to each Lender to submit Bid Quotes offering to make the Bid Absolute Rate Loans to which such Bid Quote Request relates in accordance with
Section 2.18.  (d) Submission and Contents of Bid Quotes. 
(i) Each Lender may, in its sole discretion, submit a Bid Quote containing an offer or offers to make Bid Absolute Rate Loans
in response to any Invitation for Bid Quotes. Each Bid Quote must comply with the requirements of this Section 2.18(d) and must be submitted to the Administrative Agent at the applicable Administrative Agents Office
not later than 9:45 a.m, in the case of Bank of America and 10:00 a.m., in the case of each other Lender, on the proposed Borrowing Date (or, in any such case upon reasonable prior notice to the Lenders, such later time as the Company and
the Administrative Agent may agree, provided that Bank of America shall always be required to submit its Bid Quotes not less than fifteen minutes prior to the other Lenders). No Lender may submit a Bid Quote for a Bid Absolute Rate Loan which
has a Bid Interest Period later than such Lenders Termination Date. Subject to Articles IV and VIII, any Bid Quote so made shall be irrevocable except with the written consent of the Administrative Agent given on the instructions
of the Company.  (ii) Each Bid Quote shall in any case specify: 
(A) the proposed borrowing date, which shall be the same as that set forth in the applicable Invitation for Bid Quotes; 
  43 


(B) the principal amount of the Bid Absolute Rate Loan for which each such offer
is being made, (1) which principal amount may be greater than, less than or equal to the Commitment of the quoting Lender, but in no case greater than the Commitments, (2) which principal amount must be at least US$5,000,000 and an
integral multiple of US$1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (3) which principal amount may not exceed the principal amount of Bid Absolute Rate Loans for which offers were requested; 
(C) the minimum or maximum amount, if any, of the Bid Absolute Rate Loan which may be accepted by the Company and/or the limit,
if any, as to the aggregate principal amount of the Bid Absolute Rate Loans from such Lender which may be accepted by the Company; 
(D) the Bid Absolute Rate offered for each such Bid Absolute Rate Loan; 
(E) the applicable Bid Interest Period; and 
(F) the identity of the quoting Lender. 
(iii) The Administrative Agent shall reject any Bid Quote that: 
(A) is not substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto or does not specify all of the information required by
Section 2.18(d)(ii);  (B) contains qualifying, conditional or similar language, other than any
such language contained in Exhibit F hereto;  (C) proposes terms other than or in addition to
those set forth in the applicable Invitation for Bid Quotes; or  (D) arrives after the time set forth in
Section 2.18(d)(i).  If any Bid Quote shall be rejected pursuant to this
Section 2.18(d)(iii), then the Administrative Agent shall notify the relevant Lender of such rejection as soon as practicable. 
(e) Notice to the Company. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company of the terms (i) of any Bid Quote submitted
by a Lender that is in accordance with Section 2.18(d) and (ii) of any Bid Quote that is in accordance with Section 2.18(d) and amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous
Bid Quote submitted by such Lender with respect to the same Bid Quote Request. Any such subsequent Bid Quote shall be disregarded by the Administrative Agent unless such subsequent Bid Quote specifically states that it is submitted solely to correct
a manifest error in such former Bid Quote. The Administrative Agents notice to the Company shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Bid Absolute 
  44 



Rate Loans for which offers have been received for each Bid Interest Period specified in the related Bid Quote Request and the respective principal amounts and Bid Absolute Rates so offered. 
(f) Acceptance and Notice by the Company. Subject to the receipt of the notice from the Administrative Agent referred to in
Section 2.18(e), not later than 11:00 a.m. on the proposed date of borrowing (or, in any such case upon reasonable prior notice to the Lenders, such later time as the Company and the Administrative Agent may agree),
the Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of the Companys acceptance or rejection of the offers so notified to it pursuant to Section 2.18(e); provided, however, that the failure by the Company
to give such notice to the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be a rejection of all such offers. In the case of acceptance, such notice (a Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice) shall specify the aggregate principal amount of
offers for each Bid Interest Period that are accepted. The Company may accept or reject any Bid Quote in whole or in part (subject to the terms of Section 2.18(d)(ii)(C)); provided that: 
(i) the aggregate principal amount of all Bid Absolute Rate Loans may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related
Bid Quote Request;  (ii) acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of ascending Bid Absolute Rates; and 
(iii) the Company may not accept any offer of the type described in Section 2.18(d)(iii) or that
otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement for the purpose of obtaining a Bid Absolute Rate Loan under this Agreement. 
(g) Allocation by the Administrative Agent. If offers are made by two or more Lenders with the same Bid Absolute Rates for a greater
aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which offers are permitted to be accepted for the related Bid Interest Period, the principal amount of Bid Absolute Rate Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated
by the Administrative Agent among such Lenders as nearly as possible (in such multiples, not greater than US$1,000,000, as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers;
provided, however, that no Lender shall be allocated a portion of any Bid Absolute Rate Loan which is less than the minimum amount which such Lender has indicated that it is willing to accept. Allocations by the Administrative Agent of
the amounts of Bid Absolute Rate Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall promptly, but in any event by 12:00 p.m. (noon), notify each Lender of its receipt of a Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice and
the aggregate principal amount of such Bid Absolute Rate Loan allocated to each participating Lender.  ARTICLE III. 
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 
3.01 Taxes.  (a)
Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes. (i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Company under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any
Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the 
  45 



Administrative Agent or the Company, as applicable) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the Administrative Agent, the Company or other applicable withholding
agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below. 
(ii) If the Company, the Administrative Agent or other applicable withholding agent shall be required by the Code to withhold
or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the applicable withholding agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent
to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the applicable withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Company shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the
making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
withholding or deduction been made.  (iii) If the Company, the Administrative Agent or other applicable withholding agent
shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) the applicable withholding agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by it
to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the applicable withholding agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall timely pay the full amount
withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Company shall be increased as
necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions for Indemnified Taxes (including deductions for Indemnified Taxes applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the
applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.  (b)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Company. Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Company shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option
of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.  (c) Tax Indemnifications. (i) The
Company shall, and does hereby, indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted
on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the
Company by a Lender or an L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall, and does
hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 Business Days after written demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender or an L/C Issuer for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the
Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(ii) below.  (ii) Each Lender and
each L/C Issuer shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 Business Days after demand therefor, (x) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender or such
L/C Issuer (but only to the extent that the Company has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), (y) the Administrative Agent and the Company, as
applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Administrative Agent and the
Company, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or the Company in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the
Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may
be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii). 
  46 


(d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Company
to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such
payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(e) Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax
with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation
prescribed by applicable Law or the taxing authorities of a jurisdiction pursuant to such applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced
rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent
as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the
completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation either (A) set forth in Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below or (B) required by applicable Law
other than the Code or the taxing authorities of the jurisdiction pursuant to such applicable Law to comply with the requirements for exemption or reduction of withholding tax in that jurisdiction) shall not be required if in the Lenders
reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which
such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that
such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 
  47 


(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so,
deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon
the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:  (I) in the
case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such
tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as
applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; 
(II) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; 
(III) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of
the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a
10 percent shareholder of the Company within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance
Certificate) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable); or 
(IV) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form
W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-2 or Exhibit L-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are
claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative
Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the
Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be
prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
  48 


(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to
U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver
to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and
to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall
include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  (iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or
certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative
Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.  (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time
shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or any L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for
the account of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Company or with
respect to which the Company has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to the Company an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts
paid, by the Company under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses
(including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Company, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to
repay the amount paid over to the Company (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to the Company pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or
additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the
Company or any other Person.  (g) Survival. Each partys obligations under this Section 3.01 shall
survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or an L/C Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other
Obligations. 
  49 


3.02 Illegality. If any Lender in good faith determines that any Law has made it unlawful,
or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit Extension or to
determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in
the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such Credit
Extension or to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, shall be suspended, and (ii) if such
notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender
shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the
circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice by the Company, (x) the Company shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans
are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent
without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender
may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the
period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender
to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Company shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 
3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion
to or continuation thereof, (a) (i) the Administrative Agent in good faith determines that deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for
the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate
Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan (in each case with respect to clause (a) above, Impacted Loans), or (b) the Administrative
Agent or the Required Lenders in good faith determine that for any reason the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of
funding such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies
shall be suspended, (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the
utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company
may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be
deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this Section, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Company and the Required Lenders, may establish an alternative interest rate for the
Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with 
  50 



respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a)(i) of this Section, (2) the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders notify the Company that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made
it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to
determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Company written notice
thereof.  3.04 Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans. 
(a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e), other than as set forth below) or any L/C
Issuer;  (ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in
clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other
liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or  (iii) impose on any Lender or any L/C Issuer or the London interbank
market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of
maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or such L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter
of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, the Company will pay to such
Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
(b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or any L/C Issuer in good faith determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such
L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders or such L/C Issuers holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or
such L/C Issuers capital or on the capital of such Lenders or such L/C Issuers holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit
held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lenders or such L/C Issuers holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law
(taking into consideration such Lenders or such L/C Issuers policies and the policies of such Lenders or such L/C Issuers holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay to such
Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lenders or such L/C Issuers holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
  51 


(c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or an L/C Issuer setting
forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Company shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate and due under such subsection within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof. 
(d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or such L/C Issuers right to demand such compensation, provided that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender
or an L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the
Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or such L/C Issuers intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is
retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
(e) Additional Reserve Requirements. The Company shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to
maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as Eurocurrency liabilities), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate
Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive, absent manifest error), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be
required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurocurrency Rate Loans,
such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good
faith, which determination shall be conclusive, absent manifest error), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Company shall have received at least 10 Business
Days prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 Business Days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or costs
shall be due and payable 10 Business Days from receipt of such notice.  3.05 Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of
any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Company shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense (other than any loss of Applicable Rate or other profit)
incurred by it as a result of:  (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day
other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); 
  52 


(b) any failure by the Company (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a
Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Company; 
(c) any failure by the Company to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an
Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; or  (d) any assignment of a Eurocurrency
Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 10.12; 
including any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain
such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract in respect of such funds. The Company shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by
such Lender in connection with the foregoing.  For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company to the Lenders under this
Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such
currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded.  3.06
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office.
Each Lender may make any Credit Extension to the Company through any Lending Office, provided that the exercise of this option shall not affect the obligation of the Company to repay the Credit Extension in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or requires the Company to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender, any L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of
any Lender or any L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then at the request of the Company such Lender or such L/C Issuer shall, as
applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such
Lender or such L/C Issuer, as applicable, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need
for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable and documented out of pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or any L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation
or assignment.  (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if
the Company is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is
unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 3.06(a), the Company may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.12. 
3.07 Survival. All obligations of the Company under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments,
repayment of all other Obligations hereunder, and resignation of the Administrative Agent. 
  53

(on which the L/C Issuers and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely until informed of any change in writing by the Company);  (f) a
written opinion of the Companys counsel, Jones Day, addressed to the Administrative Agent, each L/C Issuer and the Lenders, in the form of Exhibit D; 
(g) Committed Loan Notes for those Lenders that have requested Committed Loan Notes at least two Business Days prior to the date hereof;

  54 


Without limiting the generality of the provisions of the last paragraph of
Section 9.03, for purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in this Section 4.01, each Lender and L/C Issuer shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to
be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender or L/C Issuer prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its objection thereto. 
4.02 Conditions to Each Credit Extension. The Lenders shall not be required to make Loans and the L/C
Issuers shall not be required to issue, amend, renew or extend Letters of Credit under this Agreement unless on the date thereof (i) no Default shall exist and (ii) the representations and warranties contained in Article V (other
than Section 5.04(b), 5.06 and 5.07) and shall be true and correct in all material respects (other than any representation or warranty qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, which shall be true and correct in all
respects) as of the date of such Credit Extension (except with respect to those representations and warranties made as of a specific date, which representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such date). On
each date on which a Bid Absolute Rate Loan is made, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the relevant Lender, a duly executed and completed Bid Note if requested. 
4.03 Conditions to Each Extension of Commitments and Each Commitment
Increase. On the date of (i) each extension pursuant to Section 2.13 hereof or (ii) the date of each increase in Commitments pursuant to Section 2.14 hereof, the Company shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the L/C Issuers and the Lenders a certificate, signed by an Authorized Officer, stating that as of such date no Event of Default exists and, in the case of each extension pursuant to
Section 2.13, that the representations and warranties contained in Section 5 are true and correct in all material respects (other than any representation or warranty qualified by materiality or

financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries most recently delivered to the Lenders, and except with respect to those representations and warranties made as of a specific date, which representations and warranties shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of such date).  ARTICLE V. 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. 
The Company represents and warrants to the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Administrative Agent that: 
5.01 Corporate Existence and Standing. Each of the Company and the Material Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation with all requisite authority to conduct its business, in each case in each jurisdiction in which the failure to obtain the necessary authority
could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the consolidated condition or operations of the Company or the ability of the Company to perform the Obligations. 
5.02 Authorization and Validity. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Loan Documents have been
duly authorized by proper corporate proceedings and the Loan Documents, when executed and delivered, will constitute valid, legal, binding and enforceable obligations of the Company. 
5.03 Compliance with Laws and Contracts. Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of the Loan
Documents, the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof will violate any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Company or any Material
Subsidiary or articles or certificates of incorporation or by-laws or the provisions of

  57 


Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company shall be
deemed to have delivered the items described in Sections 6.01(a), (b) and (c) to the Administrative Agent if the applicable item has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other applicable governmental authority and is freely
and readily available without charge to the Administrative Agent on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission or such other applicable governmental authority, or such item has been made freely and readily available without charge to the
Administrative Agent on the Companys website www.conagrabrands.com, and the delivery date therefor shall be deemed to be the first day on which the applicable item is available to the Administrative Agent on one of such web pages. 
The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make available to the Lenders and
the L/C Issuers materials and/or information provided by or on behalf of the Company hereunder (collectively, Company Materials) by posting the Company Materials on IntraLinks, Syndtrak, ClearPar, or a substantially similar
electronic transmission system (the Platform) and (b) certain of the Lenders (each, a Public Lender) may have personnel who do not wish to receive material non-public
information with respect to any of the Company or its Affiliates, or the securities of any of the foregoing, and who may be engaged in investment and other market-related activities with respect to such Persons securities. The Company hereby
agrees that (w) all Company Materials that are to be made available to Public Lenders shall be clearly and conspicuously marked PUBLIC which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word PUBLIC shall appear prominently on the
first page thereof; (x) by marking Company Materials PUBLIC, the Company shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders to treat such Company Materials as not containing any material non-public information with respect to the Company or its securities for purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws (provided, however, that to the extent such Company Materials
constitute confidential information, they shall be treated as set forth in Section 10.07); (y) all Company Materials marked PUBLIC are permitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform

calculations necessary to determine compliance with Sections 7.01 and 7.02 of this Agreement and stating that there exists no Default or, if any such Default exists, specifying the nature thereof and what action the Company has taken
or proposes to take with respect thereto. The Company also covenants that forthwith upon any Authorized Officer obtaining knowledge of a Default under this Agreement, it 
  58 



will deliver to the Administrative Agent an Officers Certificate specifying the nature thereof and what action the Company has taken or proposes to take with respect thereto. Where the
financial statements required by Section 6.01(a) or (b) above are necessary to determine whether all covenants herein have been complied with, or whether an Event of Default has occurred, the most recent
financial statements referred to in Section 6.01(a) or (b) above shall be used to make such determination. 
6.03 Sale and Lease-Back. If a Sale and Lease-Back Transaction (as defined in
Section 3.7 of the Indenture) occurs that (i) results in net proceeds to the Company or a Subsidiary in excess of US$50,000,000, and (ii) requires the retirement by the Company of debt pursuant to
Section 3.7(c) of the Indenture, then the Company shall, within 90 days following the effective date of such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, offer to the Lenders to use the net proceeds of such Sale and
Lease-Back Transaction to prepay, without premium, an amount of the principal amount of the Loans of the Lenders (on a ratable basis). Such amount shall be based on a fraction, the numerator of which would be the principal amount of Loans then
outstanding and the denominator of which would be the principal amount outstanding of all funded debt for which the Company is required by the terms thereof to make similar offers. Such offer would be terminated if not accepted in writing within 5
Business Days following the date of such offer. For purposes of this Section, the applicable provisions of the Indenture shall be deemed incorporated herein mutatis mutandis without the effect of any amendment, waiver or termination of
the Indenture.  ARTICLE VII.

to EBITDA Ratio. The Company will maintain as of the end of each of its fiscal quarters a ratio of Consolidated Funded Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of not greater than 3.75:1.00 on a four quarter rolling basis, provided

such acquisition and related increase (provided however there shall be at least two fiscal quarters at 3.75:1.00 between step-ups). 
7.03 Consolidation, Merger, Sale or Conveyance. The Company will not merge or consolidate with any other
corporation or sell or convey (including by way of lease) all or substantially all of its assets to any Person, unless (i) the Company shall be the continuing corporation or the successor corporation and (ii) immediately after such
merger or consolidation, or such sale or conveyance, no Default shall exist and be continuing.  7.04 Liens. The Company will
perform, comply with and observe for the benefit of the Lenders its agreements in Section 3.6 of the Indenture. For purposes hereof, the provisions of said Section 3.6 of the Indenture, together
with related definitions and ancillary provisions, are hereby incorporated herein by reference, mutatis mutandis, and shall be deemed to continue in effect for the benefit of the Lenders (as if they held Securities under the Indenture)
as in effect on the date hereof, whether or not said provisions otherwise remain in effect or are modified or terminated; provided that for purposes of this incorporation by reference, each reference in said Section to
Securities shall be deemed to include the Notes issued hereunder, and if the Company is required by said Section 3.6 to equally and ratably secure the Securities, the Company shall cause the Notes and the
Obligations to be secured by Liens equally and ratably with the Securities (without implying in any way that the Notes are securities for purposes of state or federal securities laws) and any and all other obligations and indebtedness secured by
such Liens.  7.05 Sanctions. The Company will not directly or indirectly, use the proceeds of any Credit Extension, or lend,
contribute or otherwise make available such proceeds to any Subsidiary, joint venture partner or other 
  59 



individual or entity, to fund any activities of or business with any individual or entity, or in any Designated Jurisdiction, that, at the time of such funding, is the subject of Sanctions and
which funding or usage would violate applicable Sanctions, or in any other manner that will result in a violation by any individual or entity (including any individual or entity participating in the transaction, whether as Lender, Arranger,
Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer, or otherwise) of applicable Sanctions.  7.06 Anti-Corruption Laws. The Company will not
directly or, to its knowledge indirectly, use the proceeds of any Credit Extension for any purpose which would breach the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the UK Bribery Act 2010, and other similar anti-corruption legislation in
other jurisdictions.  ARTICLE VIII.

THE AGENTS.  9.01
Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Except as
expressly provided in Section 9.06, the provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers, and the Company shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary
of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting
parties.  9.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or
unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial
advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account
therefor to the Lenders. 
  62 


9.03 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: 
(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; 
(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for
herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any such action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is
contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a
Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and  (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any of the Company or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent
or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) in accordance
with the terms hereof with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the
circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Company,
a Lender or an L/C Issuer.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement,
warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith,
(iii) the performance or observance by any other Person of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or
genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly
required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. 
  63 


9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall
be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or
other distribution) reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it
to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit,
that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice to the contrary from such Lender or such L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
9.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and
powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of
the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the
extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such
sub-agents.  9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent. (a) The
Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Company. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Company at all
times other than during the existence of a Specified Event of Default (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of
any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its
resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C
Issuers, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above, provided that in no event shall any such successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such
resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.  (b) If the Person serving as
Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Company and such Person remove such Person as
Administrative Agent and, with the consent of the Company at all times other than during the existence of a Specified Event of Default (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), appoint a successor. If no such
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Removal Effective Date), then such
removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.  (c) With effect from the
Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its 
  64 



duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C
Issuers under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) except for any indemnity payments or
other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and each L/C Issuer
directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and
become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or removed) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 3.01(g) and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other
amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and
obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its
predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the retiring or removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and
Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of
them (i) while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent and (ii) after such resignation or removal for as long as any of them continues to act in any capacity hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents, including (a) holding any cash collateral security on behalf of any of the Lenders and (b) in respect of any actions taken in connection with transferring the agency to any successor Administrative Agent. 
(d) Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer.
If Bank of America resigns as an L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all
L/C Obligations with respect thereto, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c). Upon the appointment by the Company
of a successor L/C Issuer hereunder (which successor shall in all cases be a Lender other than a Defaulting Lender), (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C
Issuer, (b) the retiring L/C Issuer shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of
Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Bank of America to effectively assume the obligations of Bank of America with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
9.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other
Lenders. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any
of their 
  65 



Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon
this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.  9.08
Arrangers, Syndication Agent, Documentation Agents. None of the Lenders identified in this Agreement as Arranger, Syndication Agent or as Documentation Agents shall have any right, power, obligation, liability,
responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes
the same acknowledgements with respect to the applicable Lenders in their capacity as Syndication Agent and Documentation Agent as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in this Agreement. 
ARTICLE X.  MISCELLANEOUS.
 10.01 Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent
to any departure by the Company therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) and the Company and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and
each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such amendment, waiver or consent shall: 
(a) waive any condition set forth in Section 4.01 without the written consent of each Lender; 
(b) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate any Commitment terminated pursuant to
Section 8.02) without the written consent of such Lender (it being understood and agreed that a waiver of any condition precedent set forth in Section 4.02 or of any Default is not considered an
extension or increase in Commitments of any Lender);  (c) postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any
payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

penultimate proviso to this Section 10.01) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender entitled to receive such amount; provided,
however, that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to amend the definition of Default Rate or to waive any obligation of the Company to pay interest or Letter of Credit Fees at the Default Rate; 
(e) change Section 8.03 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the
written consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby;  (f) amend the definition of Alternative Currency without the

Required Lenders or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder without the written
consent of each Lender; 
  66 


and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by the L/C Issuer, affect the rights or duties of the L/C Issuer under this Agreement or any Issuer Document relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by it; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by the Administrative Agent, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and (iii) each Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing
executed only by the parties thereto; provided, further, the Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the Company only, amend, modify or supplement this Agreement and any related documents executed by the Company to cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, in each case, of a technical or immaterial nature so long as (x) such amendment, modification or supplement does not directly adversely affect any right of any Agent or Lender, and (y) the
Required Lenders shall not have objected in writing within five (5) Business Days of such amendment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be
effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment
or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender disproportionately adversely relative to other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender. 
10.02 Notices; Effectiveness; Electronic Communication.

  67 



that, if not given during normal business hours for the recipient, shall be deemed to have been given at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient). Notices and other
communications delivered through electronic communications to the extent provided in subsection (b) below, shall be effective as provided in such subsection (b). 
(b) Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to the Lenders and the L/C Issuers hereunder may be delivered or
furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail, FpML messaging, and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent, provided that the foregoing shall
not apply to notices to any Lender or L/C Issuer pursuant to Article II if such Lender or L/C Issuer, as applicable, has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic
communication. The Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or the Company may each, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it, provided
that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.  Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise
prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the senders receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the
return receipt requested function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed
received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the
website address therefor; provided that, for both clauses (i) and (ii), if such notice, email or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice, email or communication
shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next business day for the recipient.  (c) The Platform. THE
PLATFORM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE. THE AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE COMPANY MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR
ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE COMPANY MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD
PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the
Agent Parties) have any liability to the Company, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the
Companys or the Administrative Agents transmission of Company Materials or notices through the Platform, any other electronic platform or electronic messaging service, or through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party or such Agent
Partys material breach of its obligations hereunder; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to the Company, any Lender, any L/C Issuer or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental,
consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages). 
  68 


(d) Change of Address, Etc. Each of the Company, the Administrative Agent and each L/C
Issuer may change its address, facsimile or telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. Each other Lender may change its address, facsimile or telephone number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the Company, the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuers. In addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record (i) an
effective address, contact name, telephone number, facsimile number and electronic mail address to which notices and other communications may be sent and (ii) accurate wire instructions for such Lender. Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to
cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the Private Side Information or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender
or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lenders compliance procedures and applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws, to make reference to Company Materials that are not made available through the
Public Side Information portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information with respect to the Company or its securities for purposes of United States Federal or state
securities laws.  (e) Reliance by Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and Lenders. The Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the
Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including telephonic or electronic notices, Committed Loan Notices and Letter of Credit Applications) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Company even if (i) such notices were not
made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Company shall
indemnify the Administrative Agent, each L/C Issuer, each Lender and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of
the Company, except to the extent that such losses, costs, expenses or liabilities are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct
of, or material breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by, the Administrative Agent, such L/C Issuer, such Lender or such Related Party. All telephonic notices to and other telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be
recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.  10.03 No Waiver;
Cumulative Remedies; Enforcement. No failure by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan Document, are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies
hereunder and under the other Loan 
  69 



Documents against the Company shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the
Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 8.02 for the benefit of all the Lenders and the L/C Issuers; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) the Administrative Agent from
exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (b) any L/C Issuer from exercising the rights and remedies that inure
to its benefit (solely in its capacity as L/C Issuer) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (c) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 10.08 (subject to the terms of
Section 2.12), or (d) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to the Company under any Debtor Relief Law; and
provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 2.12, any Lender may, with
the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders.  10.04
Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.  (a) Costs and Expenses. The Company shall reimburse the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders for any and all reasonable documented (in reasonable detail) out-of-pocket expenses paid or incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers or the Lenders in connection with the collection and enforcement (in the case of legal fees and expenses, limited to the reasonable and invoiced attorneys fees for a single counsel for the Administrative
Agent and, solely in the case of any conflict of interest, one additional counsel for all the L/C Issuers and Lenders other than the Administrative Agent) of the Loan Documents. 
(b) Indemnification by the Company. The Company shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any
sub-agent thereof), each Lender and each L/C Issuer, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee
harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (in the case of legal fees and expenses, limited to the reasonable documented (in reasonable detail) fees, disbursements and other charges of a single external
counsel to all Indemnitees (and, solely in the case of any conflict of interest, one additional external counsel for all such persons taken as a whole)) by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any Person (including the Company) other
than such Indemnitee and its Related Parties to the extent arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or
thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including in respect of any matters addressed in Section 3.01),
(ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by an L/C Issuer to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by it if the documents presented in connection with
such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit) or 
  70 



(iii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a
third party or by the Company, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related
expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from such Indemnified Partys bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement or (y) arise out of any investigation, litigation or proceeding that does not involve an act or omission by the Company and arise solely from a dispute among Indemnitees (except when and to the extent that one of the parties to
such dispute was acting in its capacity as an agent, arranger, bookrunner, L/C Issuer or other agency capacity and, in such case, excepting only such party). Without limiting the provisions of Section 3.01(c), this
Section 10.04(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim. 
(c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Company for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under
subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders pro rata share (determined as of the time that the
applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought based on each Lenders share of the Total Credit Exposures of all Lenders at such time) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid amount in respect of a claim asserted by
such Lender), such payment to be made severally among them based on such Lenders Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought), provided further that the
unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or any L/C Issuer
in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or the L/C Issuer in connection with such capacity. The obligations of
the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.11(d).  (d)
Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no party hereto shall assert, and each party hereto hereby waives, and acknowledges that no other Person shall have, any claim against any Indemnitee, on
any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof; provided that the foregoing shall not relieve the Company of any indemnification obligation with respect to claims
by third parties. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such
Indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, other than for direct or actual damages
resulting from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or material breach of this Agreement by, such Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
  71 


(e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten
Business Days after written (in reasonable detail) demand therefor.  (f) Survival. The agreements in this Section and the indemnity
provisions of Section 10.02(e) shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or
discharge of all the other Obligations.  10.05 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of
the Company is made to the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, such L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee,
receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended
to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and each L/C Issuer severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon
demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the applicable
Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, in the applicable currency of such recovery or payment. The obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the
Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.  10.06 Successors and Assigns. 
(a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Company may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each
Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in
accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment
or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby,
Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
  72 


(b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all
or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations) at the time owing to it);
provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:  (i) Minimum Amounts. 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment and the related Loans
at the time owing to it or contemporaneous assignments to related Approved Funds (determined after giving effect to such Assignments) that equal at least the amount specified in paragraph (b)(i)(B) of this Section in the aggregate or in the case of
an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and  (B) in
any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding
balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified
in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than US$5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consents (each such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  (ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as
an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned; 
(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection
(b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:  (A) the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) a Specified Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund;
provided that the Company shall be deemed to have consented to an assignment if it has not objected thereto in writing within ten Business Days after notice thereof to it as required by Section 10.02; 
(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such
assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender; and 
(C) the consent of each L/C Issuer (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any
assignment.  (iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of US$3,500 (to be paid by the assignor or assignee); provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole
discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. 
(v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Company or any of the
Companys controlled Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (B) any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this
clause (B), or (C) a natural Person (or to a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person). 
(vi) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting
Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in 
  73 



addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon
distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent, the
applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed
by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit
in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the
provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of
the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01 (subject to the requirements thereof, including
Section 3.01(e)), 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the
affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Company (at its expense) shall execute
and deliver a Committed Loan Note or Bid Note, as applicable, to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of
this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section. 
(c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Company (and such agency being solely for tax
purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders,
and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive absent manifest error, and the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Company at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  (d)
Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Company or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for,
or owned and operated for the

primary benefit of a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender or the Company or any of the Companys controlled Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a
portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lenders participations in L/C Obligations) owing to it); provided that
(i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Company, the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be
responsible for the indemnity under Section 10.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation.  Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. The Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.01(e), it being understood that the documentation
required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section;
provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 10.12 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a
greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Companys request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate
with the Company to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.12 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting
solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Company, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register
(including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such
disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries
in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding
any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
  75 


(e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note(s), if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge
or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
(f) Resignation as L/C Issuer after Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank of
America assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, upon 30 days notice to the Company and the Lenders, resign as an L/C Issuer. In the event of any such resignation as an L/C
Issuer, the Company shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Company to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America
as an L/C Issuer. If Bank of America resigns as an L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit issued by it and outstanding as of the effective date of
its resignation as an L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)). Upon the appointment by the Company of a successor L/C Issuer (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer and
(b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Bank of America to effectively assume
the obligations of Bank of America with respect to such Letters of Credit.  10.07 Treatment of Certain
Information; Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers agrees to hold any information which it may receive from the Company or its representatives pursuant to this Agreement in confidence,
except for disclosure as required (i) to its Affiliates and to other Lenders and their respective Affiliates (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such information
and instructed to keep such information confidential), (ii) to legal counsel, accountants, and other professional advisors to such Person (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such information and instructed to keep such information confidential), (iii) to regulatory officials having jurisdiction over such Person to the extent requested thereby, (iv) to any Person as required by law, regulation, or
legal process, (v) to any Person in connection with any legal proceeding to which such Lender is a party, (vi) to such Lenders or such L/C Issuers direct or indirect contractual counterparties in swap agreements relating to the
Company or its obligations or to legal counsel, accountants and other professional advisors to such counterparties; provided that each counterparty agrees to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this
Section 10.07, (vii) to rating agencies if requested or required by such agencies in connection with a rating relating to the transactions evidenced hereby, (viii) to any Person with the consent of the Company,
(ix) to any credit insurance provider relating to the Company and its Obligations under this Agreement, provided that such credit insurance provider agrees to be bound (with the Company an express third party beneficiary) by the
confidentiality provisions of this Section 10.07, (x) to self-regulatory officials having authority over such Person to the extent requested thereby, and (xi) to the extent such information becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 10.07. The Company authorizes each Lender to disclose to any assignee or participant described in Section 10.06 or any other Person
acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a Transferee) and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lenders possession concerning the creditworthiness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; provided that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound (with the Company an express third party beneficiary) by the confidentiality provisions of this Section 10.07. 
  76 


Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers acknowledges that (a) the
Information may include material non-public information concerning the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities
Laws.  10.08 Right of Setoff. If the Company becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Event of Default occurs,
the Company agrees to recognize, honor and comply with the right of setoff that each Lender and each of its Affiliates may have under any applicable law and each Lender with a Loan agrees that any assets of the Company available to such Lender or
such Affiliate for setoff shall be shared with all the Lenders with an outstanding Loan so that each such Lender receives for offset a share of such assets equal to the proportion that such Lenders Loans bear to the sum of all the then
outstanding Loans; provided, that if any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.16 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders,
and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each
Lender, each L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and L/C
Issuer agrees to notify the Company and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 
10.09 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties
hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees
payable to the Administrative Agent or an L/C Issuer, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject
matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof
that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging means (e.g. pdf or tif)
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.  10.10 Survival of
Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall survive delivery of the Notes, the issuance of any Letters of Credit and the making of the Loans herein
contemplated.  10.11 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations
to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.11, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any
provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuers, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only
to the extent not so limited.  10.12 Replacement of Lenders. If the Company is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant
to the provisions of Section 2.13 or 3.06, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the 
  77 



Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject
to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and
obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that: 
(a) the Company shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in
Section 10.06(b);  (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal
of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the
extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts);  (c) in the case of
any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such
compensation or payments thereafter;  (d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and 
(e) in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the
applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent;  provided that the failure by such Lender
to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption shall not impair the validity of the removal of such Lender and the mandatory assignment of such Lenders Commitments and outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations pursuant to
this Section 10.12 shall nevertheless be effective without the execution by such Lender of an Assignment and Assumption. 
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  10.13 Governing
Law; Jurisdiction; Etc.  (a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND ANY CLAIMS,
CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE) BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (EXCEPT, AS TO ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH THEREIN) AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
(b) SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT COMMENCE

  78 



ANY ACTION, LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO OR ANY RELATED PARTY OF THE
FOREGOING IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATING HERETO OR THE

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.
 10.15 No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all aspects of each transaction
contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Company acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its controlled Affiliates 
  79 



understanding, that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, and the Lenders are
arms-length commercial transactions between the Company, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders, on the other hand, (B) the Company has consulted its own legal,
accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) the Company is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other
Loan Documents; (ii) (A) the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and each Lender is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an
advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Company or any of is Affiliates, or any other Person, in connection herewith and (B) neither the Administrative Agent, any Arranger nor any Lender has any obligation to the Company or any of its Affiliates
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be
engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and its Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent, any Arranger nor any Lender has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the
Company or any of its Affiliates. The Company hereby agrees that it will not claim that any of the Administrative Agent, any Arranger, any Lender and their respective Affiliates has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect or owes a
fiduciary duty or similar duty to it in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.  10.16 Electronic
Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents. The words execute, execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in or related to any
document to be signed in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without limitation Assignment and Assumptions, amendments or other modifications, Committed Loan Notices, waivers and consents) shall be
deemed to include electronic signatures, the electronic matching of assignment terms and contract formations on electronic platforms approved by the Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the
same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures
in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; provided that notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary
the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to agree to accept electronic signatures in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it. 
10.17 USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent (for
itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Company that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the
Act), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Company, which information includes the name and address of the Company and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative
Agent, as applicable, to identify the Company in accordance with the Act. The Company shall, promptly following a request by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all documentation and other information that the Administrative Agent or
such Lender reasonably requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the Act. 
10.18 Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder
or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on
the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Company in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any
judgment in a currency (the Judgment Currency) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the Agreement Currency), be discharged only to the
extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in
accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Company
in the Agreement Currency, the Company agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding 
  80 



any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum
originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to the Company (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto
under applicable Law).  10.19 Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
neither any L/C Issuer nor any Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to the Company in an amount in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any applicable statute or regulation. 
10.20 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS
REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR
SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES. 
10.21 Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA
Financial Institutions. Solely to the extent any Lender or L/C Issuer that is an EEA Financial Institution is a party to this Agreement and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement,
arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender or L/C Issuer that is an EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may
be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by: 
(a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may
be payable to it by any Lender or L/C Issuer that is an EEA Financial Institution; and  (b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:  (i) a reduction in full
or in part or cancellation of any such liability;  (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or
other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in
lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or  (iii) the
variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.
