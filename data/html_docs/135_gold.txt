2.02                        Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans.
 
(a)                                 Each Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made upon the Borrowers irrevocable (subject to Section 3.03) notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by (A) telephone or (B) a Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Loan Notice.  Each such Loan Notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. (i) two Business Days prior to the requested date of (A) any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans, or (B) any conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans, and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans; provided, however, that if the Borrower wishes to request Eurodollar Rate Loans having an Interest Period other than seven days, one month, two months, three months or six months in duration as provided in the definition of Interest Period, the applicable notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. three Business Days prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation, whereupon the Administrative Agent (x) shall give prompt notice to the Lenders of such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is acceptable to all such Lenders and (y) not later than 12:00 p.m., two Business Days before the requested date of such Borrowing,

conversion or continuation, shall notify the Borrower (which notice may be by telephone) whether or not the requested Interest Period has been consented to by all the Lenders; provided, further, if any requested Borrowing or portion thereof is to be utilized exclusively for working capital purposes (such Borrowing or such portion being called a Working Capital Borrowing), the Borrower shall specify in the Loan Notice that such Borrowing or such portion is a Working Capital Borrowing.  In addition, any repayment of a Loan that is intended as a repayment of all or any part of the outstanding amount of one or more Working Capital Borrowings shall be so identified to the Administrative Agent at the time of such repayment.  Each telephonic notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower.  Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof.  Except as provided in Section 2.03(b), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof.  Each Loan Notice shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Loans are to be converted, and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto.  If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to Base Rate Loans.  Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans.  If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.
 
(b)                                 Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in the preceding subsection.  In the case of a Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agents Office not later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice.  Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing consists of the initial Loans, Sections 4.01 and 4.02), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent, at the Borrowers election, either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided in the corresponding Loan Notice; provided, however, if such instructions significantly differ from instructions of similar nature which customarily have been given by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, and accepted by the Administrative Agent, then following prompt notice by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower that such differing
 
25





 
instructions are not reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, then on instructions otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower.

(d)                                 The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate.  At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in Bank of Americas prime rate used in determining the Base Rate and the effective date thereof promptly following the public announcement of such change.
 
(e)                                  After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in effect at any one time with respect to Loans.

(ii)           If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount

shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

(c)           Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein.  Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

(a)           Facility Fee.  The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a facility fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Commitments (or, if the Aggregate Commitments have terminated, on the Outstanding Amount of all Loans), regardless of usage, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.12.  The facility fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period (and thereafter so long as any Loans remain outstanding), including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Section 4.02 is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period (and, if applicable, thereafter on demand).  The facility fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.
 
(b)           Other Fees.  (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its account an agency fee in the amount specified in the Fee Letter.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever, except as expressly set forth therein.

28





 
computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).  Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.10(a), bear interest for one day.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
 
2.09        Evidence of Debt.  The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing on its payment Obligations.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender to the Borrower made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lenders Loans to the Borrower in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach schedules to a Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

(a)           General.  All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agents Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lenders Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
 
(b)           (i)  Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
 
29





 
Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such principal or interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such principal and interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid (excluding interest and fees as aforesaid) shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
 
(ii)           Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
 
(c)           Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent.  If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to the Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Loans set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
 
30





 
(d)           Obligations of Lenders Several.  The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(d) are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under Section 10.04(d) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under Section 10.04(d).
 
(e)           Funding Source.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
 
2.11             Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  Subject to Section 10.08 with respect to a Defaulting Lender, if any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans or accrued interest thereon greater than its Applicable Percentage thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:
 
(i)            if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
 
(ii)           the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any permitted assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).
 
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
2.12        Defaulting Lenders.  (a)   Adjustments.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law:
 
31





 
(i)            Waivers and Amendments.  That Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 10.01.
 
(ii)           Reallocation of Payments.  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.08), shall, following application by Administrative Agent of any such payment by or on behalf of the Borrower to the account of such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Obligation paid (and in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.10(a) or such other provision of this Agreement applicable with respect to the distribution thereof), be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in an interest bearing deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders hereunder or as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower hereunder or as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that, with respect to this clause sixth, if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all respective non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of that Defaulting Lender.  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.12(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 
(iii)          Certain Fees.  That Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any facility fee pursuant to Section 2.07(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender and the Borrower shall not be required to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Defaulting Lender or the Defaulting Lender any such fee, and no such fees shall accrue for the account of the Defaulting Lender, that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender.
 
32





 
(b)           Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to reimbursement of costs and expenses to the Borrower), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages, whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
(c)           Rights and Remedies against a Defaulting Lender.  The Borrower may replace any Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 10.13.  The rights and remedies against, and with respect to, a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.12 are in addition to, and cumulative and not in limitation of, all other rights and remedies that each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower may, at any time, have against, or with respect to, such Defaulting Lender.
 
ARTICLE III.     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY
 
3.01        Taxes.
 
(a)           Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes.  (i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to the extent permitted by applicable Laws be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes.  If, however, applicable Laws require the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to withhold or deduct any Tax, such Tax shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with such Laws as determined by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below.
 
(ii)           If the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all
 
33





 
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.
 
(iii)          If the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.
 
(b)           Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.  Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes arising from payments required to be made by it hereunder or from its execution and delivery of, or performance by it of, or otherwise with respect to its obligations under, any Loan Document to which it is a party and imposed thereon under applicable Law to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws.
 
(c)           Tax Indemnifications.  (i) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, the Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 Business Days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  The Borrower shall also, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender (other than a Lender that is an affiliate of the Administrative Agent) for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required by clause (ii) of this subsection.  A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  However, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be entitled to receive any payment with respect to Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes that are incurred or accrued more than 180 days prior to the date the Administrative Agent or such Lender gives notice and demand thereof to the Borrower.
 
34





 
(ii)           Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, each Lender shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, against any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and expenses (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Borrower or the Administrative Agent by any Governmental Authority as a result of the failure by such Lender to deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any documentation required to be delivered by such Lender to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (e).  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii).  The agreements in this clause (ii) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other payment Obligations.
 
(d)           Evidence of Payments.  As soon as reasonably practicable after request by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be.
 
(e)           Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation.  (i)  Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable Laws or when reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Laws or by the taxing authorities of any jurisdiction and such other reasonably requested information as will permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, (A) to determine (1) whether or not payments made by the Borrower to such Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document are subject to Taxes or information reporting, (2) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction with respect to such payments, and (3) such Lenders entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or (B) to establish such Lenders status for withholding tax purposes in the applicable jurisdictions.
 
(ii)           Without limiting the generality of clause (i) above, if the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States,
 
(A)          any Lender that is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the
 
35





 
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower on behalf of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements;
 
(B)          each Foreign Lender that is entitled under the Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower on behalf of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so, or at such times prescribed by applicable Law), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(I)            executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or successor applicable form, claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,
 
(II)          executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, or successor applicable form,
 
(III)        executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, or successor applicable form, and all required supporting documentation,
 
(IV)         in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or successor applicable form, or
 
(V)          executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(C)          if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender or
 
36





 
Administrative Agent were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender or Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender or Administrative Agent has complied with such Lenders or Administrative Agents obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (C), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
(iii)          Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction in withholding taxes, (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent make any withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender, and (C) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (1) such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable Law following the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent documentation previously delivered pursuant to this subsection (e) so as to maintain compliance with such Lenders obligations thereunder, and (2) prior to the date on which any documentation delivered pursuant to this subsection (e) expires or becomes obsolete, such documentation as may be necessary to maintain compliance with such Lenders obligations thereunder.
 
(iv)          The Borrower shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall reasonably request, such documents and forms reasonably requested as are required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by the Borrower, to be furnished by such Lender or the Administrative Agent under such Laws in connection with any payment by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of Taxes or Other Taxes, or otherwise in connection with the Loan Documents, with respect to such jurisdiction.
 
(f)            Treatment of Certain Refunds.  Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender.  If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal
 
37





 
to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 3.01with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses and net of any loss or gain realized in the conversion of such funds from or to another currency incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
 
3.02        Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
 
3.03        Inability to Determine Rates.  If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (i) deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank
 
38





 
Eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (iii) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.  Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended (i) in respect to the applicable amount and Interest Period referred to in clause (i) of the preceding sentence, or (ii) in the circumstances referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence, shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
 
3.04        Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.
 
(a)           Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall:
 
(i)            impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e));
 
(ii)           subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender); or
 
(iii)          impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Eurodollar Rate Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), in each case, by an amount deemed in good faith by such Lender to be material, then, within five Business Days after written demand therefor by such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(b)           Capital Requirements.  If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, by an amount deemed in good faith by such Lender to be material based on that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time within five Business Days after written demand therefor, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c)           Certificates for Reimbursement.  A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  Upon request by the Borrower, a Lender shall also provide a certificate that such Lender is generally requesting such compensation from its other borrowers.
 
(d)           Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
 
(e)           Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.  The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurodollar funds or deposits (currently known as Eurodollar liabilities), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurodollar Rate Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have received at least 10 days prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender.  If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment
 
40





 
Date, such additional interest or costs shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.
 
3.05        Compensation for Losses.  Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
 
(a)           any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
 
(b)           any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
 
(c)           any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;
 
excluding any loss of anticipated profits but including any loss (other than loss of anticipated profits) or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.  The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
 
A certificate of such Lender setting forth the amount of any such loss, cost or expense, including reasonably detailed calculations thereof, shall be delivered to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and be conclusive absent manifest error.  For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank Eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
 
3.06        Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
 
(a)           Designation of a Different Lending Office.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such Lender shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
41





 
(b)           Replacement of Lenders.  If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02 and does not subsequently designate a different Lending Office or assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates as provided above, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, or (iv) any Lender fails to consent to an election, consent, amendment, waiver or other modification to this Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires the consent of (A) the Required Lenders, and such election, consent, amendment, waiver or other modification is otherwise consented to by the Required Lenders, or (B) all Lenders (or all Lenders directly affected thereby), and such election, consent, amendment, waiver or other modification is otherwise consented to by Supermajority Lenders, then in each case, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13.
 
3.07        Survival.  All of the Borrowers obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.

5.10        Disclosure.  There is no fact known to any Restricted Person that has not been disclosed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in writing which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  No report, financial statement, certificate or other information furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the negotiation of this Agreement (including those delivered hereunder or under any other Loan Document (in each case, as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished, when so modified or supplemented)) contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading as of the date made or deemed made (or if such information expressly relates or refers to an earlier date, as of such earlier date); provided that, with respect to projected and forecast financial information, the Borrower represents only that such projections and forecasts were prepared in good faith based upon assumptions deemed reasonable by it at the time.
 
5.11        Compliance with Laws.  Except as set forth in Schedule 5.11 or in accordance with Section 6.03, the Borrower and each Subsidiary thereof is in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of all Laws and all orders, writs, injunctions and decrees applicable to it or to its properties, except in such instances in which (a) such requirement of Law or order, writ, injunction or decree is being contested in good faith, and if necessary, by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted or (b) the failure to comply therewith, either individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

47





 
5.13        Anti-Corruption Laws.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries (a) are in compliance with (i) the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as applicable to them, and (ii) other similar anti-corruption legislation in other relevant jurisdictions in which they maintain assets or engage in business, which otherwise are applicable to them (collectively, the Laws referred to in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), the Anti-Corruption Laws), other than any failure or failures to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws (A) that are isolated and do not evidence a pervasive or systemic pattern of violations of such laws and regulations or a significant deficiency in the implementation of the hereinafter referenced policies and procedures to promote and achieve compliance by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries with Anti-Corruption Laws and are immaterial to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (B) that arise from actions or incidents that have been publicly disclosed by the Borrower or disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent (with a copy to Lenders), in each case, at least twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date, and (b) have instituted and maintain commercially reasonable policies and procedures which they reasonably believe are designed to promote and achieve their respective compliance with such laws.

provided; for purposes of this Section 7.08, Consolidated EBITDA may include, at the Borrowers option, any Material Project EBITDA Adjustments or New Cavern EBITDA Adjustments as provided below, limited in each case with respect to any non-wholly-owned Subsidiaries to a proportional amount of such adjustments equal to the Borrowers direct or indirect ownership interest therein.
 
As used herein, Material Project EBITDA Adjustments means, with respect to the construction or expansion of any capital project of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Unrestricted Subsidiaries), the aggregate capital cost of which (inclusive of capital costs expended prior to the acquisition thereof) is reasonably expected by the Borrower to exceed, or exceeds, $50,000,000 (a Material Project):
 
(A)                               prior to the date on which a Material Project has achieved commercial operation (the Commercial Operation Date) (but including the fiscal quarter in which such Commercial Operation Date occurs), a percentage (based on the then-current completion percentage of such Material Project) of an amount to be approved by the Administrative Agent as the projected Consolidated EBITDA attributable to such Material Project for the first 12-month period following the scheduled Commercial Operation Date of such Material Project, such amount based only on (i) projected revenues from firm fixed-fee contracts (subject to adjustments for customer creditworthiness) and tariffs relating to such Material Project, less expenses, (ii) projected Commercial Operations Date (to be no more than 18 months from the fiscal quarter in which such Material Project EBITDA Adjustment is initially proposed), and (iii) other factors reasonably deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent, which may, at the Borrowers option, be added to actual Consolidated EBITDA for the fiscal quarter in which construction or expansion of such Material Project commences and for each fiscal quarter thereafter until the Commercial Operation Date of such Material Project (including the fiscal quarter in which such Commercial Operation Date occurs, but net of any actual Consolidated EBITDA attributable to such Material Project following such Commercial Operation Date); provided that if the actual Commercial Operation Date does not occur by the scheduled Commercial Operation Date, then the foregoing amount shall be reduced, for quarters ending after the scheduled Commercial Operation Date to (but excluding) the first full quarter after its Commercial Operation Date, by the following percentage amounts depending on the period of delay (based on the period of actual delay or then-estimated delay, whichever is longer): (i) 90 days or less, 0%, (ii) longer than 90 days, but not more than 180 days, 25%, (iii) longer than 180 days but not more than 270 days, 50%, (iv) longer than 270 days but not more than 365 days, 75%, and (v) longer than 365 days, 100%;
 
(B)                               beginning with the first full fiscal quarter following the Commercial Operation Date of a Material Project and for the two immediately succeeding fiscal quarters, an amount to be approved by the Administrative Agent as the projected Consolidated EBITDA attributable to such Material Project for the balance of the four full fiscal quarter period following such Commercial Operation Date, which may, at the Borrowers option, be added to actual Consolidated EBITDA for such fiscal quarters; and
 
57





 
(C)                               the aggregate amount of all Material Project EBITDA Adjustments and New Cavern EBITDA Adjustments during any period shall be limited to 15% of the total actual Consolidated EBITDA for such period (which total actual Consolidated EBITDA shall be determined without including any Material Project EBITDA Adjustments or New Cavern EBITDA Adjustments).
 
As used herein, New Cavern EBITDA Adjustments means, with respect to each new gas storage cavern at the Pine Prairie Storage Facility or the Southern Pines Storage Facility which achieves commercial operation (the date on which such commercial operation is achieved, the New Cavern Commercial Operations Date) after the Closing Date, an amount submitted by the Borrower and approved by Administrative Agent as the projected Consolidated EBITDA attributable to the additional storage capacity attributable to such new gas storage cavern (initially giving pro forma effect as if such New Cavern Commercial Operations Date occurred on the first day of the fiscal quarter in which it occurred, and thereafter such pro forma quarterly adjustments rolling off and being replaced by actual performance on a quarterly basis).  New Cavern EBITDA Adjustments shall be based only on (i) projected revenues from firm fixed-fee storage contracts (subject to adjustments for customer creditworthiness) and tariffs relating to such new cavern, less expenses, (ii) the New Cavern Commercial Operations Date with respect to each such new cavern, and (iii) other factors reasonably deemed appropriate by Administrative Agent.
 
In addition, for purposes of this Section 7.08, Hybrid Securities up to an aggregate principal amount of 15% of Consolidated Total Capitalization shall be excluded from Consolidated Funded Indebtedness.
 
Deliverables for Material Project EBITDA Adjustments and New Cavern EBITDA Adjustments
 
The Borrower shall, no later than three Business Days prior to its delivery of a Compliance Certificate for any fiscal quarter for which the Borrower desires to include Material Project EBITDA Adjustments or New Cavern EBITDA Adjustments, deliver to Administrative Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent and certified by a financial officer of the Borrower, written pro forma projections of Consolidated EBITDA attributable to such Material Project EBITDA Adjustments or New Cavern EBITDA Adjustments, and such other related information and documentation reasonably requested by and reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent in all respects, including with respect to Material Project EBITDA Adjustments, certification as to Material Project completion percentage, expected Commercial Operations Date and no material delays with respect thereto.
 
7.09                                        Unrestricted Subsidiaries.  So long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and immediately after giving effect to such designation on a pro forma basis, no Default or Event of Default would result therefrom, the Borrower or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Borrower may designate one or more Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries (each such Subsidiary, and each of its Subsidiaries, an Unrestricted Subsidiary), which Unrestricted Subsidiaries shall be subject to the following:
 
58





 
(a)                                 No Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a Restricted Person or a Subsidiary of the Borrower for purposes of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be subject to or included within the scope of any provision herein or in any other Loan Document, including without limitation any representation, warranty, covenant or Event of Default herein or in any other Loan Document, except as set forth in this Section 7.09.
 
(b)                                 No Restricted Person shall guarantee or otherwise become liable in respect of any Indebtedness of, grant any Lien on any of its property (other than its Equity Interests in an Unrestricted Subsidiary) to secure any Indebtedness of or other obligation of, or provide any other form of credit support to, any Unrestricted Subsidiary, and no Restricted Person shall enter into any contract or agreement with any Unrestricted Subsidiary, except on terms no less favorable to such Restricted Person, as applicable, than could be obtained in a comparable arms length transaction with a non-Affiliate of such Restricted Person; provided, Restricted Persons may guarantee trade accounts payable of Unrestricted Subsidiaries that arise in the ordinary course of business in an amount not to exceed five percent (5%) of the Borrowers Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.
 
(c)                                  The Borrower shall at all times maintain, as between Restricted Persons and Unrestricted Subsidiaries, the separate existence of each Unrestricted Subsidiary.
 
(d)                                 Restricted Persons shall notify each Lender Party, not later than five (5) Business Days after any executive officer of Restricted Persons has knowledge of, any claim, including any claim under any Environmental Law, or any notice of potential liability under any Environmental Law, asserted against any Unrestricted Subsidiary or with respect to any Unrestricted Subsidiarys properties that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, stating that such notice is being given pursuant to this Section 7.09.
 
The Borrower may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Person if a Default or Event of Default is not continuing, such designation would not, immediately after giving effect thereto, result in a Default or an Event of Default, and immediately thereafter such Subsidiary has no outstanding Indebtedness.  Immediately thereafter, the Borrower shall promptly notify Administrative Agent of such designation and provide to it an officers certificate that such designation was made in compliance with this Section 7.09.

ARTICLE IX.                ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

62





 
behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions (other than the right to reasonably approve a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.06).
 
9.02                        Rights as a Lender.  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
9.03                        Exculpatory Provisions.  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
 
(a)                                 shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;
 
(b)                                 shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; and
 
(c)                                  shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender.
 
63





 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
 
9.04                        Reliance by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
9.05                        Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
 
9.06                        Resignation or Removal of Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower, which notice shall set forth the proposed date of resignation, which shall be not less than 30 days after the date of such notice, during which time the Administrative Agent shall continue to act as the Administrative Agent hereunder, unless sooner replaced or removed in accordance with the provisions hereof.  In addition, at any time the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person, remove such Person as Administrative Agent.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation or issuance of notice of removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor (subject to consultation with the Borrower, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
 
64





 
continuing), which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation or the Required Lenders issue such notice of removal, then the retiring or removed Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above (subject to consultation with the Borrower, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing); provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation or removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section.  Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired or removed) Administrative Agent, and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section).  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
 
9.07                        Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
9.08                        No Other Duties, Etc.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Bookrunners, Arrangers, Co-Syndication Agents or Co-Documentation Agents listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.
 
65





 
9.09                        Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise
 
(a)                                 to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.08 and 10.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
 
(b)                                 to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same in accordance with Section 8.03;
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.08 and 10.04, in each case, in accordance with Section 8.03.
 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.
 
9.10                        Collateral Matters.  The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon termination of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all payment Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations), (ii) that is sold or to be sold as part of or in connection with any sale not prohibited hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or (iii) subject to Section 10.01, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders.  Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agents authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property pursuant to this Section 9.10.

Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender), in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights (A) in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or (B) in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans, other than expenses of a Defaulting Lender proximately caused by conduct, acts or omissions described in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of Defaulting Lender.
 
(b)                                 Indemnification by the Borrower.  The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Lender (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against any and all liabilities, obligations, claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, actions, judgments, suits, settlements, costs, expenses or disbursements (including reasonable fees of attorneys, accountants, experts and advisors) of any kind or nature whatsoever (in this section collectively called liabilities and costs) which to any extent (in whole or in part) may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such Lender Party growing out of, resulting from or in any other way associated with the Loan Documents and the transactions and events (including the enforcement or defense thereof) at any time associated therewith or contemplated therein and the Borrowers use of Loan proceeds (whether arising in contract or in tort or otherwise and including any violation or noncompliance with any Environmental Laws by any Indemnitee or any other Person or any liabilities or duties of any Indemnitee or any other Person with respect to Hazardous Materials found in or released into the environment).  In the case of an investigation, litigation or proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 10.04 applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Borrower, any of its equity holders, Affiliates or creditors or an Indemnitee or any third party and whether or not an Indemnitee is otherwise a party thereto.
 
(c)                                  THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATION SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH LIABILITIES AND COSTS ARE IN ANY WAY OR TO ANY EXTENT OWED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, UNDER ANY CLAIM OR THEORY OF STRICT LIABILITY OR CAUSED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BY ANY NEGLIGENT ACT OR OMISSION OF ANY KIND BY ANY INDEMNITEE, provided only that no Indemnitee shall be entitled under this section to receive indemnification for that portion, if any, of any liabilities and costs which (i) is proximately caused by its own (A) individual gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment, or (B) material breach of any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Documents, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment, (ii) arises by reason of a claim (A) by any one or more Indemnitees against any one or more other Indemnitees or (B) by an equity-interest owner of any Indemnitee against any one or more Indemnitees, so long as in either such case, such claim is not proximately caused solely by the breach hereunder or under any other Loan Document by the Borrower or its Affiliates or (iii) are incurred by an Indemnitee that is a Defaulting Lender, and such liabilities or costs are proximately caused by conduct, acts or omissions described in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of Defaulting Lender.  If any Person (including the Borrower or any of its Affiliates) ever alleges gross
 
71





 
negligence or willful misconduct pursuant to the preceding clause (i)(A) (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not with respect to an allegation of a material breach pursuant to the preceding clause (i)(B)) by any Indemnitee, the indemnification provided for in this section shall nonetheless be paid upon demand, subject to later adjustment or reimbursement, until such time as a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final judgment as to the extent and effect of the alleged gross negligence or willful misconduct.  As used in this section the term Indemnitee shall refer not only to each Person designated as a Lender Party in Section 1.01 but also to each director, officer, trustee, agent, attorney, employee, representative and Affiliate of such Persons.  So long as no Default has occurred and is continuing and the Borrower is financially solvent, no Indemnitee may settle any claim to be indemnified without the consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; provided that the Borrower may not reasonably withhold consent to any settlement that an Indemnitee proposes, if the Borrower does not have the financial ability to pay all its obligations outstanding and asserted against the Borrower at that time, including the maximum potential claims against the Indemnitee to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 10.04.
 
(d)                                 Reimbursement by Lenders.  To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), or any applicable Related Party of any of the foregoing, without affecting the Borrowers payment obligations with respect thereto, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in connection with such capacity.  The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (d) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.10(d).
 
(e)                                  Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no party hereto or Related Party of any party hereto shall assert, and hereby waives, any claim against each other party hereto and its Related Parties (including, as applicable, each Indemnitee), on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.  No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than as a result of such Indemnitees gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of any of its obligations under any Loan Document.
 
(f)                                   Payments.  All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten Business Days after demand therefor and the Borrowers receipt of reasonably detailed invoices or statements related thereto.
 
72





 
(g)                                  Survival.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.
 
10.05                 Payments Set Aside.  To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.  The obligations of the Lenders under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
 
10.06                 Successors and Assigns.
 
(a)                                 Successors and Assigns Generally.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
(b)                                 Assignments by Lenders.  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
 
(i)                                     Minimum Amounts.
 
(A)                               in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the
 
73





 
case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and
 
(B)                               in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met.
 
(ii)                                  Proportionate Amounts.  Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned;
 
(iii)                               Required Consents.  No consent shall be required for any such assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:
 
(A)                               the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof; and
 
(B)                               the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender.
 
(iv)                              Assignment and Assumption.  The parties to each assignment permitted by Section 10.06(b) shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment.  The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
 
74





 
(v)                                 No Assignment to Certain Persons.  No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or (C) to a natural person.
 
(vi)                              Certain Additional Payments.  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment.  Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender against receipt by the Borrower of the cancelled original Note of the assignor, if its entire Commitment was assigned, or evidence that such assignors Note is marked to reflect its reduction.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.
 
(c)                                  Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments
 
75





 
of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time and recordation of Assignments and Assumptions (the Register).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender.   The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice, and the Administrative Agent shall provide any information therein as the Borrower shall reasonably request from time to time.
 
(d)                                 Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower, any other Lender or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement.
 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant.  Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.01 (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01 shall be delivered to the participating Lender) and the obligations imposed by such Sections) and shall be subject to replacement pursuant to Section 3.06 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at such Lenders request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.11 as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, solely for tax purposes, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant in such Lenders Loans and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each such Participants interest in such Lenders Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of its Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in such Lenders commitments, loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that
 
76





 
such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the Treasury regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in such Lenders Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
(e)                                  Limitations upon Participant Rights.  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01, 3.04 or 3.05 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply and complies with Section 3.01(e) as though it were a Lender.
 
(f)                                   Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note(s), if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(g)                                  Lost Notes.  Upon receipt of an affidavit reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower of an officer of any Lender as to the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of its Note which is not of public record, and, in the case of any such loss, theft, destruction or mutilation, upon cancellation of such Note, the Borrower will execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a replacement Note in the principal amount of such Lenders then Commitment or if no Commitment is in effect, the outstanding principal amount owed to such Lender and otherwise of like tenor.
 
10.07                 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality.  Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (for itself and each of its Related Parties) agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, trustees, advisors and representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential and will maintain such confidences), (b) to the extent requested or required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, including in connection with any pledge or assignment made pursuant to Section 10.06(f), (c) subject to this Section 10.07, to any other party hereto, (d) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in connection with any Default or anticipated Default, the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (e) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant
 
77





 
in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to, and requested by, the Borrower and its obligations, (f) with the consent of the Borrower or (g) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower.
 
For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any of them, or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
 
Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws.
 
10.08                 Right of Setoff.  At any time and from time to time during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is hereby authorized, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply against the payment Obligations then due and payable (without notice to any Restricted Person), any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.  The rights of each Lender and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or its Affiliates may have.  Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.
 
10.09                 Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate).  If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an
 
78





 
amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.
 
10.10                 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or other electronic imaging means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
 
10.11                 Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.  Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Loan, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied.
 
10.12                 Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.  The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.
 
10.13                 Replacement of Lenders.  If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04 or gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02 and does not subsequently designate a
 
79





 
different Lending Office or assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates as provided in Section 3.06(a), (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (iv) any Lender fails to consent to an election, consent, amendment, waiver or other modification to this Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires the consent of (A) the Required Lenders, and such election, consent, amendment, waiver or other modification is otherwise consented to by the Required Lenders, or (B) all Lenders (or all Lenders directly affected thereby), and such election, consent, amendment, waiver or other modification is otherwise consented to by Supermajority Lenders, or (v) any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:
 
(a)                                 unless paid by the assignee or waived by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.06(b);
 
(b)                                 such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to 100% of the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05 and subject to Section 2.12) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
 
(c)                                  in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
 
(d)                                 such assignment does not violate applicable Laws.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing rights of the Borrower under this Section, the Borrower may not replace any Lender which seeks compensation under Section 3.04 or reimbursement under Section 3.01 unless the Borrower is replacing all Lenders which are then seeking such compensation or reimbursement.
 
10.14                 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc.
 
(a)                                 GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
 
(b)                                 SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.  THE BORROWER IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN NEW YORK COUNTY AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

10.20                 Time of the Essence.  Time is of the essence of the Loan Documents.
 
10.21                 ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.  THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES.
