Borrower from time to time in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding the Swingline Commitment or (ii) the total Revolving
Facility Credit Exposure exceeding the total Revolving Facility Commitments; <u>provided</u> that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Borrowing. Within the foregoing limits and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans. </p>

such request in writing by a Swingline Borrowing Request by electronic transmission not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Borrowing. Each such notice and Swingline Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and
shall specify (i) the requested date (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) the amount of the requested Swingline Borrowing and (iii) the location and number of the Borrowers account to which funds comprising the requested Swingline
Borrowing are to be disbursed. The Swingline Lender shall consult with the Administrative Agent as to whether the making of the Swingline Loan is in accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Swingline Lender funding such Swingline
Loan. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan in accordance with Section 2.02(a) on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 3:00 p.m., Local Time, to the account of the Borrower (or, in the
case of a Swingline Borrowing made to finance the reimbursement of an L/C Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the applicable Issuing Bank). </p>

in which the Revolving Facility Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each such Lender, specifying in such notice such Revolving Facility Lenders Revolving Facility
Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Facility Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender, such
Revolving Facility Lenders Revolving Facility Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Facility Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset,
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Facility Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to

it from the Revolving Facility Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to
the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds
of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Facility Lenders that shall

agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term Administrative Agent shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and
approval, and the former Administrative Agents rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this
Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agents notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative
Agents resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as
provided for above. After any retiring Administrative Agents resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative
Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto,
and such amendments or supplements to the Mortgages, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may reasonably request, in order to (a) continue the perfection of the Liens granted or
purported to be granted by the Security Documents or (b) otherwise ensure that the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement is satisfied, the Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion,
privileges, and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. </p>

support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap Agreement or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, <u>QFC Credit Support</u>, and each such QFC, a <u>Supported QFC</u>), the parties
acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with
the regulations promulgated thereunder, the <u>U.S. Special Resolution Regimes</u>) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a)    In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a <u>Covered Party</u>) becomes
subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights
in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit
Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding
under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater
extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the
foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support. </p>
