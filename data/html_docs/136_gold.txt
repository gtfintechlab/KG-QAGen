WHEREAS, Borrower desires to obtain the Loan from Lender; and
 
WHEREAS, Lender is willing to make the Loan to Borrower, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants set forth in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree, represent and warrant as follows:
 
ARTICLE 1 
 
THE LOAN
 
Section 1.1 The Loan.
 
1.1.1 Agreement to Lend and Borrow.  Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, Lender shall make the Loan to Borrower, and Borrower shall borrow the same from Lender.  Any amount borrowed and repaid hereunder in respect of the Loan may not be reborrowed.
 
1.1.2 The Note.  The Loan shall be evidenced by that certain Promissory Note dated as of the Closing Date, in the stated principal amount of Five Million and No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) executed by Borrower and payable to the order of Lender (the “Note”).
 
1.1.3 Use of Proceeds.  Borrower shall use proceeds of the Loan (a) to make initial deposits of the Reserve Funds, (b) to pay costs and expenses related to the closing of the Loan, including fees payable to Lender, (c) to release any Lien encumbering the Collateral, (d) to pay any delinquent Property Taxes and Other Charges and (e) if any proceeds remain thereafter, for such lawful purpose as Borrower shall determine.
 
Section 1.2 Interest Rate.
 
1.2.1 Interest Rate.  The Outstanding Principal Balance shall accrue interest throughout the Term at the Interest Rate.  On each Payment Date, Borrower shall pay to Lender all interest accrued or to be accrued during the Interest Period in which such Payment Date occurs.
 
1.2.2 Default Rate.  For so long as any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Outstanding Principal Balance and all other portions of the Debt, shall accrue interest at the Default Rate.  Interest at the Default Rate shall be paid immediately upon demand, which demand may be made as frequently as Lender shall determine.

1.2.3 Interest Calculation.  Interest on the Loan and other Obligations shall be calculated by multiplying (a) the actual number of days in the Interest Period or other period for which the calculation is being made by (b) a daily rate based on a three hundred sixty (360) day year (i.e., the Interest Rate expressed as an annual rate divided by 360) by (c) the Outstanding Principal Balance as of the first day of the applicable Interest Period or the amount of such other Obligations, as applicable.
 
Section 1.3 Loan Payments.
 
1.3.1 Payments.  On the Closing Date, Borrower shall pay interest on the Outstanding Principal Balance from the Closing Date through and including February 7, 2015 (the “Initial Interest Period”).  On March 8, 2015, and on the 8th day of each month thereafter during the Term (each, a “Payment Date”), Borrower shall make a payment of principal and interest equal to the Monthly Debt Service Payment.
 
1.3.2 Payments Generally.  After the Initial Interest Period, each interest accrual period (the Initial Interest  Period and each such accrual period, an “Interest Period”) shall commence on the 8th day of a calendar month and shall end on (and include) the 7th day of the following calendar month.  Lender shall have the right from time to time, in its sole discretion, upon not less than ten (10) days’ prior written notice to Borrower, to change the Payment Date to a different calendar day and, if requested by Lender, Borrower shall promptly execute an amendment to this Agreement to evidence such change; provided that (a) if Lender shall change the Payment Date as aforesaid, Lender shall make a corresponding change to the Interest Period and (b) the Maturity Date and any other date in the Loan Documents which corresponds with a Payment Date shall be automatically amended to reflect the Payment Date as so adjusted.
 
1.3.3 Payment on Maturity Date.  Borrower shall pay to Lender on the Maturity Date the Outstanding Principal Balance, all accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts due under the Loan Documents.
 
1.3.4 Late Payment Charge.  If any amount due under the Loan Documents is not paid on the date on which it is due, Borrower shall pay to Lender upon demand an amount equal to the lesser of three percent (3.00%) of such unpaid sum or the maximum amount permitted by Legal Requirements in order to defray the expense incurred by Lender in handling and processing such delinquent payment and to compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such delinquent payment.
 
1.3.5 Method and Place of Payment.  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments shall be made to Lender not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date when due and shall be made in U.S. Dollars in immediately available funds at such place as Lender from time to time shall designate.  Any funds received by Lender after such time shall be deemed to have been paid on the following Business Day.  Whenever any payment to be made under any Loan Document shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.  All payments required to be made by Borrower under the Loan Documents shall be made irrespective of, and without deduction for, any setoff, claim or counterclaim and shall be made irrespective of any defense thereto.

1.3.6 Allocated Loan Amounts.  All reductions of principal, whether prepayments or regularly scheduled amortization, shall reduce the Allocated Loan Amounts of the Properties on a pro rata basis, except only that prepayments of the Release Amount for any Release Property shall reduce the Allocated Loan Amount for such Property until the same is zero, and then any excess of such principal prepaid shall reduce the Allocated Loan Amounts of the remaining Properties on a pro rata basis.
 
Section 1.4 Prepayments.
 
1.4.1 Voluntary Prepayments.  If Borrower delivers to Lender a Prepayment Notice, Borrower may, on any Business Day, prepay the Debt in whole or in part, which prepayment shall be made together with the amounts required by Section 1.4.4.  Except for mandatory prepayments, each such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of at least $100,000 and in integral multiples of $25,000 in excess thereof.  On one (1) occasion prior to the Stated Maturity Date and one (1) additional occasion prior to any final Maturity Date thereafter, Borrower may revoke a Prepayment Notice previously sent to Lender with ten (10) Business Days advance written notice to Lender and payment to Lender of any costs, fees and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with the revocation of such Prepayment Notice.
 
1.4.2 Mandatory Prepayments.  Borrower shall prepay the Outstanding Principal Balance in the amounts set forth below, which prepayments shall be made together with the amounts required by Section 1.4.4.
 
(a) Transfer.  If at any time any Property is Transferred to a third party, then no later than the applicable Transfer Date, Borrower shall prepay the Outstanding Principal Balance in an amount equal to the applicable Release Amount.
 
(b) Condemnation or Casualty.  If Borrower is required to make any prepayment under Section 4.3 or Section 4.4 as a result of a Condemnation or Casualty, on the next occurring Payment Date following the date on which Lender actually receives the applicable Net Proceeds, the lesser of (i) the applicable Release Amount and any other amounts required to be paid to Transfer such affected Property under Section 1.5 hereof, and (ii) one hundred percent (100%) of such Net Proceeds and all other amounts required to be prepaid pursuant to Section 4.3 or Section 4.4, as applicable, shall be applied to the prepayment of the Debt in accordance with Section 1.4.4.
 
(c) Payment from Cash Management Account.  Lender may collect any prepayment required under this Section 1.4.2 from the Cash Management Account on the date such prepayment is payable hereunder.
 
1.4.3 Prepayments After Default.  If, during the continuance of an Event of Default, payment of all or any part of the Debt is tendered by Borrower and accepted by Lender or is otherwise recovered by Lender (including through application of any Reserve Funds), such tender or recovery shall be deemed to be a voluntary prepayment by Borrower and Borrower shall pay, as part of the Debt, all amounts required under Section 1.4.4.

1.4.4 Prepayment Requirements.
 
(a) On the date on which a prepayment, voluntary or mandatory, is made, Borrower shall pay to Lender the following:
 
(i) all accrued and unpaid interest calculated at the Interest Rate on the amount of principal being prepaid through and including the date of such prepayment, together with an amount equal to the interest that would have accrued at the Interest Rate on the amount of principal being prepaid through the end of the Interest Period in which such prepayment occurs (the “Prepayment Interest Period”), notwithstanding that such Interest Period extends beyond the date of prepayment;
 
(ii) if such prepayment is made after the Payment Date in the Prepayment Interest Period, an amount (the “Interest Shortfall”) equal to all interest on the principal amount being prepaid which would have accrued during the Interest Period immediately following the Prepayment Interest Period (the “Succeeding Interest Period”), calculated at (A) the Interest Rate if such prepayment occurs on or after the Determination Date for the Succeeding Interest Period or (B) the Assumed Note Rate if such prepayment occurs before such Determination Date, subject to adjustment as provided below;
 
(iii) if the prepayment is made prior to the Spread Maintenance Date, the Spread Maintenance Premium applicable to such prepayment, other than with respect to a prepayment under Section 1.4.2(b) or (c); and
 
(iv) all other sums, then due under the Loan Documents.
 
(b) If (i) the Interest Shortfall is paid upon an Assumed Note Rate and (ii) the actual Interest Rate for the Succeeding Interest Period is greater or less than such Assumed Note Rate, then excess Interest Shortfall (calculated based on the actual Interest Rate) shall be refunded promptly by Lender, and any underpayment of Interest Shortfall (calculated in the same manner) shall be paid by Borrower on the Payment Date following the applicable prepayment.
 
(c) Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of Lender incurred in connection with the prepayment (including reasonable attorneys’ fees).
 
(d) Except during an Event of Default, funds delivered to Lender in connection with any prepayment shall be applied in the following order of priority: (i) first, to any amounts (other than principal, interest, Interest Shortfall and Spread Maintenance Premium) then due and payable under the Loan Documents, including any costs and expenses of Lender in connection with such prepayment; (ii) second, interest on the principal amount being prepaid at the Interest Rate through the end of the Prepayment Interest Period; (iii) third, any Interest Shortfall on the principal amount being prepaid; (iv) fourth, Spread Maintenance Premium on the principal amount being prepaid; and (v) fifth, to principal.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, during the continuance of any Event of Default, any payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable under the Loan Documents from whatever source (including Rents collected by Lender from Tenants) may be applied by Lender among the Obligations in such order, priority and proportions as Lender shall determine.

(e) If a prepayment is made pursuant to Section 1.4.2(a) or (b), then commencing with the first Payment Date that is more than ten (10) Business Days after the date of prepayment, Lender shall have the right to adjust the Monthly Debt Service Payment and/or Monthly Amortization Amount to reflect the decrease in the Outstanding Principal Balance as a result of such prepayment, which adjustments shall only result in the same amount of annual amortization of the principal balance of the Loan, as a percentage thereof as specified herein, both prior to such decrease in the Outstanding Principal Balance and after such adjustment.  Lender will notify Borrower in writing of its determination of the adjusted Monthly Debt Service Payment amount, which notice shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error.

(f) the Release Property shall be Transferred to a Person who is not a Relevant Party or an Affiliate of a Relevant Party, pursuant to a bona fide all-cash sale on arms-length terms and conditions; except that if the Transfer and release is to cure a Qualified Release Property Default, then the Release Property may be Transferred to a Person who is an Affiliate of Borrower or Equity Owner but is not a direct or indirect subsidiary of either of them, for consideration then paid in cash equal to not less than the BPO Value of the Property, as determined by Lender;
 
(g) on the Transfer Date, Borrower shall pay to Lender the applicable Release Amount together with the amounts required by Section 1.4.4, which aggregate amount shall be transferred directly to the Cash Management Account by the closing title company or escrow agent for the Transfer;
 
(h) Borrower shall submit to Lender, not less than five (5) Business Days’ prior to the Transfer Date, a draft release for the applicable Mortgage (and, in the event the Mortgage applicable to the Release Property encumbers other Property(ies) in addition to the Release Property, such release shall be a partial release that relates only to the Release Property and does not affect the Liens and security interests encumbering or the other Property(ies)) in form and substance appropriate for the jurisdiction in which the Release Property is located and which shall contain standard provisions protecting the rights of Lender; and in addition, Borrower shall provide all other documentation of a ministerial or administrative nature that Lender reasonably requires to be delivered by Borrower in connection with such release or assignment;
 
(i) Borrower shall pay all Taxes and all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) of Lender and/or its Servicer in connection with the release and, in addition, the current reasonable and customary fee being assessed by Lender and/or its Servicer to effect the release;
 
(j) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, if the Loan is included in a REMIC Trust and the ratio of the unpaid principal balance of the Loan to the value of the remaining Properties (as determined by Lender using any commercially reasonable method permitted to a REMIC Trust, and which shall exclude the value of any personal property (other than fixtures) or going concern value, if any) exceeds or would exceed 125% immediately after giving effect to the release of the Release Property, no release will be permitted unless the principal balance of the Loan is prepaid by an amount not less than the greater of (i) the Release Amount or (ii) the least amount that is a “qualified amount” as that term is defined in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2010-30, as the same may be amended, replaced, supplemented or modified from time to time, unless Lender receives an opinion of counsel that, if this paragraph is applicable but not followed or is no longer applicable at the time of such release, the REMIC Trust will not fail to maintain its status as a REMIC Trust as a result of the release of the Release Property; and

Section 1.7 Taxes.
 
1.7.1 Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Legal Requirements.  If any Legal Requirement (as determined in the good faith discretion of Borrower) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by Borrower, then Borrower shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Legal Requirements and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 1.7) Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.

1.7.2 Indemnification by Borrower.  Borrower shall indemnify Lender, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 1.7) payable or paid by Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to Lender and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
 
1.7.3 Payment of Indemnified Taxes.  Borrower shall pay (i) to the applicable Governmental Authority as and when due all Indemnified Taxes, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, and (ii) to Lender, within fifteen (15) days after written request by Lender, all other Indemnified Taxes.  Promptly following written request by Lender, Borrower shall deliver to Lender evidence, reasonably satisfactory to Lender, of payment of Indemnified Taxes.
 
1.7.4 Foreign Taxes.  All payments made by Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, assessments, fees, charges, reserves or withholdings (including, without limitation, backup withholdings) imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, which are imposed, enacted or become effective after the date hereof (such taxes being referred to collectively as “Foreign Taxes”), excluding income and franchise taxes of the United States of America imposed by the jurisdiction under the laws of which Lender is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein or imposed by the jurisdiction of Lender’s applicable lending office where Lender is resident or engaged in business or any political subdivision or taking authority thereof or therein and Taxes imposed under FATCA as a result of Lender’s failure to comply with Section 1.7.5 hereof.  If any Foreign Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to Lender (after payment of all Foreign Taxes) principal, interest and/or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rate or in the amounts specified hereunder.  Whenever any Foreign Taxes are payable pursuant to applicable law by Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter, Borrower shall send to Lender an original official receipt, if available, or certified copy thereof showing payment of such Foreign Taxes.  Borrower hereby indemnifies Lender for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by Lender which may result from any failure by Borrower to pay any such Foreign Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or any failure by Borrower to remit to Lender the required receipts or other required documentary evidence.
 
1.7.5 Tax Forms.  Prior to the date that any Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States of America becomes a party hereto, such Lender shall deliver to Borrower such certificates, documents or other evidence, as required by the Code issued pursuant thereto (including Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8ECI and W-8BEN, as applicable, or appropriate successor forms), properly completed, currently effective and duly executed by such Lender establishing that payments to it hereunder and under the Note are (i) not subject to United States Federal backup withholding tax and (ii) not subject to United States Federal withholding tax under the Code.  Each such Lender shall (y) deliver further copies of such forms or other appropriate certifications on or before the date that any such forms expire or become obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form delivered to the Borrower and (z) obtain such extensions of the time for filing, and renew such forms and certifications thereof, as may be reasonably requested by Borrower.  If a payment made to a Lender under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA and such Lender fails to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA, such Lender shall deliver (A) a certification signed by the chief financial officer, principal accounting officer, treasurer or controller, and (B) other documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower sufficient for Borrower to comply with its obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such applicable reporting requirements.  Borrower shall not be required to pay any amount pursuant to Section 1.7.4 above to any Lender that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States of America if such Lender fails to comply with the requirements of this Section 1.7.5.  Borrower will not be required to pay any additional amounts in respect of United States federal income tax pursuant to Section 1.7.4 above to Lender if the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by Lender to comply with its obligations under this Section 1.7.5.

(b) All insurance required by Section 4.1(a) shall (i) be obtained by Borrower under valid and enforceable policies (collectively, the “Policies” or in the singular, the “Policy”), (ii) be issued by financially sound and responsible insurance companies authorized to do business in the states where the applicable Properties are located and having a claims paying ability or financial strength (as applicable) rating of either (x) ”A-:VIII” or better with an outlook of “Positive” or “Stable” in the current Best’s Insurance Reports, (y) ”A” or better by S&P or (z) ”A2” or better by Moody’s, and (iii) be subject to the approval of Lender as to form and substance, including insurance companies, amounts, deductibles, loss payees and insureds.  Not later than ten (10) days prior to the expiration of each Policy, Borrower shall pay the premiums (“Insurance Premiums”) for renewal or replacement (with a Policy conforming in all respects to the requirements set forth herein) of the same, and shall deliver to Lender certificates of insurance evidencing such renewal or replacement Policy (and, upon the written request of Lender, a copy of such Policy) accompanied by evidence satisfactory to Lender of payment of such Insurance Premiums.
 
(c) The insurance coverage required by Section 4.1(a) may be effected under a blanket policy or policies covering the Properties and other property and assets not constituting a part of the Properties; provided that any such blanket policy has been approved in advance by Lender in writing.  Prior to any approval of such blanket policy, Lender shall be satisfied by evidence required by Lender that such any blanket policy shall provide coverage in an amount and scope which is at least equal to what would be provided if the required coverage was purchased on an individual basis and which shall in any case comply in all other respects with the requirements of this Article 4.
 
(d) All Policies of insurance required by Section 4.1(a), except for the worker’s compensation Policy referenced in paragraph 7 of Exhibit B, shall name Borrower as the insured and Lender and its successors and/or assigns as mortgagee and loss payee, as its interests may appear, and in the case of property damage, windstorm, flood and earthquake insurance, shall contain a so-called New York standard non-contributing mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing that the loss thereunder shall be payable to Lender unless below the threshold for Borrower to handle such claim without Lender intervention as provided in Section 4.2.  Additionally, if Borrower obtains property insurance coverage in addition to or in excess of that required by paragraph 1 on Exhibit B, then such insurance policies shall also contain a so-called New York standard non-contributing mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing that the loss thereunder shall be payable to Lender.

(e) All Policies of insurance required by Section 4.1(a), except for the worker’s compensation Policy referenced in paragraph 7 of Exhibit B, shall contain clauses or endorsements to the effect that:
 
(i) no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting for Borrower, or of any Tenant or other occupant, or failure to comply with the provisions of any Policy, which might otherwise result in a forfeiture of the insurance or any part thereof, shall in any way affect the validity or enforceability of the insurance insofar as Lender is concerned;
 
(ii) the Policy shall not be canceled without at least thirty (30) days’ written notice to Lender and any other party named therein as an additional insured (other than in the case of non-payment in which case only ten days prior notice, or the shortest time allowed by applicable Legal Requirement (whichever is longer), will be required) and shall not be materially changed (other than to increase the coverage provided thereby) without such a thirty (30) day notice;
 
(iii) Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums thereon or subject to any assessments thereunder; and
 
(iv) the issuers thereof shall give notice to Lender if a Policy has not been renewed ten (10) days prior to its expiration.
 
(f) If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence that all insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall have the right, without notice to Borrower, to take such action as Lender deems reasonably necessary to protect its interest in the Properties, including the obtaining of such insurance coverage as Lender reasonably determines and all premiums incurred by Lender in connection with such action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by Borrower to Lender upon demand and until paid shall be secured by the Collateral Documents and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

(a) If a partial Condemnation of a Property does not interfere with the use of such Property as a residential rental property, then the Net Proceeds paid by the condemning authority shall be applied to the prepayment of the Debt in accordance with Section 1.4.2(b).
 
(b) If a partial Condemnation of a Property does interfere with the use of such Property as a residential rental property or if there occurs a complete Condemnation of a Property (each, a “Fully Condemned Property”), then (i) Lender may retain any Net Proceeds received by it, (ii) Borrower shall immediately deliver to Lender any Net Proceeds paid to Borrower, (iii) Net Proceeds shall be applied to the prepayment of the Debt in accordance with Section 1.4.2(b) and (iv) Borrower shall prepay the Loan in an amount equal to the positive difference between such Net Proceeds and the Allocated Loan Amount for the Fully Condemned Property, together with all interest and other amounts required to be paid in connection therewith under Section 1.4.4 (collectively, the “Fully Condemned Property Prepayment Amounts”).  Following Borrower’s written request after receipt by Lender of the Net Proceeds and payment by Borrower of the Fully Condemned Property Prepayment Amounts, Lender shall release the Fully Condemned Property from the applicable Mortgages and related Lien, provided that (x) Borrower has delivered to Lender a draft release (and, in the event the Mortgage applicable to the Fully Condemned Property encumbers other Property(ies) in addition to the Fully Condemned Property, such release shall be a partial release that relates only to the Fully Condemned Property and does not affect the Liens and security interests encumbering or on the other Property(ies)) in form and substance appropriate for the jurisdiction in which such Fully Condemned Property is located and shall contain standard provisions protecting the rights of Lender and (y) Borrower shall pay all costs, Taxes and expenses associated with such release (including cost to file and record the release and Lender’s reasonable attorneys’ fees).

(e) If the Restoration Conditions are satisfied under Section 4.4(b), then Lender may impose such reasonable requirements on the use or expenditure of Net Proceeds as Lender may require, in accordance with Lender’s standard construction lending practices or in any other manner approved by Lender.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Lender may, at its option, condition disbursement of Net Proceeds on (i) delivery of an Expenditures Certificate reasonably satisfactory to Lender, (ii) completion of a property inspection reasonably satisfactory to Lender, (iii) Lender’s approval of plans and specifications of an architect satisfactory to Lender; (iv) the identity, experience, reputation and financial condition of contractors and subcontractors; (v) contractor’s cost estimates; (vi) architect’s certificates; (vii) waivers of liens; (viii) sworn statements of mechanics and materialmen and such other evidence of costs; (ix) percentage completion of construction; (x) frequency of disbursements; (xi) application of payments; (xii) customary retainage and satisfaction of liens, in each case, as Lender may reasonably require.  The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the remaining balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender after the Restoration has been completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4.4(e), and the receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory to Lender that all costs incurred in connection with the Restoration have been paid in full, shall be remitted by Lender to Borrower, provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be continuing.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, including the provisions of Section 4.3 or Section 4.4, if the Loan is included in a REMIC Trust and, immediately following a release of any portion of the Lien of a Mortgage following a Casualty or Condemnation of a Property (but taking into account any proposed Restoration of the remaining portion of such Property), the ratio of the Outstanding Principal Balance to the value of the remaining Properties is greater than 125% (such value to be determined, in Lender’s sole discretion, by any commercially reasonable method permitted to a REMIC Trust; and which shall exclude the value of personal property (other than fixtures) or going concern value, if any), the Outstanding Principal Balance must be paid down (by application of the Net Proceeds or Award, as applicable, or if such amounts are not sufficient, by Borrower) by a “qualified amount” as that term is defined in the IRS Revenue Procedure 2010-30, as the same may be amended, replaced, supplemented or modified from time to time, unless Lender receives an opinion of counsel that if such amount is not paid, the applicable REMIC Trust will not fail to maintain its status as a REMIC Trust as a result of the related release of such portion of the Lien of such Mortgage.  If and to the extent the preceding sentence applies, only such amount of the net Award or net Insurance Proceeds (as applicable), if any, in excess of the amount required to pay down the principal balance of the Loan may be released for purposes of Restoration or released to Borrower as otherwise expressly provided in Section 4.3 or Section 4.4.
 
(h) In the event of foreclosure of a Mortgage, or other transfer of title to a Property or Properties in extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt, then all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to the Policies that are not blanket Policies then in force concerning such Property or Properties and all proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest in the purchaser at such foreclosure or Lender or other transferee in the event of such other transfer of title.
 
Section 4.5 Insurance Proceeds and Awards.  Borrower shall cooperate with Lender, in accordance with this Agreement, to enable Lender to receive the benefits of any Insurance Proceeds or Awards payable in connection with any Property, and Lender shall be reimbursed for any expenses incurred in connection therewith (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and the payment by Borrower of the reasonable expense of an appraisal on behalf of Lender in case of Casualty or Condemnation affecting any Property or any part thereof) out of such Insurance Proceeds or Awards.

(a) During the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender shall have the right from time to time to partially foreclose any Mortgage or the Lien of any of the other Collateral Documents in any manner and for any amounts secured by the Collateral Documents then due and payable as determined by Lender, including the following circumstances:  (i) if Borrower defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of one or more scheduled payments of principal and interest, Lender may foreclose one or more of the Mortgages or other Collateral Documents to recover such delinquent payments, or (ii) if Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire Outstanding Principal Balance, Lender may foreclose one or more of the Mortgages or other Collateral Documents to recover so much of the principal balance of the Loan as Lender may accelerate and such other sums secured by the Mortgages and the other Collateral Documents as Lender may elect.  Notwithstanding one or more partial foreclosures, the Collateral shall remain subject to the Mortgages and the other Collateral Documents to secure payment of the sums secured by the Collateral Documents and not previously recovered.
 
(b) During the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender shall have the right from time to time to sever the Note and the other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes, Collateral Documents and other security documents in such denominations as Lender shall determine for purposes of evidencing and enforcing its rights and remedies provided under the Loan Documents.  Borrower shall, and shall cause Equity Owner to, execute and deliver to Lender from time to time, promptly after the request of Lender, a severance agreement and such other documents as Lender shall request in order to effect the severance described in the preceding sentence, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender.  Borrower hereby absolutely and irrevocably appoints Lender as its true and lawful attorney, coupled with an interest, in its name and stead to make and execute all documents necessary or desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower ratifying all that its said attorney shall do by virtue thereof; provided, however, Lender shall not make or execute any such documents under such power until three days after notice has been given to Borrower by Lender of Lender’s intent to exercise its rights under such power.

(c) During the continuance of an Event of Default, any amounts recovered from the Collateral may be applied by Lender toward the payment of any interest and/or principal of the Loan and/or any other amounts due under the Loan Documents, in such order, priority and proportions as Lender determines.
 
6.2.4 Lender’s Right to Perform.  If any Loan Party fails to pay or perform any obligation under any Loan Document or any Management Agreement, Lender may, but shall have no obligation to, pay, perform, or cause the performance of, such obligation, in which case all costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), liabilities, penalties and fines incurred or paid by Lender in connection therewith shall be paid or reimbursed by Borrower to Lender upon demand, and shall bear interest from such demand at the Default Rate.  Lender need not give advance notice of any such action if Lender determines in good faith that it would incur risk of adverse consequences by doing so, and otherwise Lender shall give five Business Days’ advance notice of any such action.  Any such payment or performance by Lender shall not limit Lender’s other rights and remedies under the Loan Documents or under any Legal Requirement and shall not be deemed to waive or release Borrower from performing any such obligation or its Obligations under the Loan Documents.
 
Section 6.3 Duration and Cure of Events of Default.  If any Event of Default shall occur (irrespective of whether or not the same consists of an ongoing condition, a one-time occurrence, or otherwise), the same shall be deemed to continue at all times thereafter; provided, however, that such Event of Default shall cease to continue, irrespective of subsequent performance or acceptance of the same, only (a) in the case of any Event of Default that consists of the failure to pay money, if the same is paid to Lender (together with any applicable late charge and interest at the Default Rate) and Lender accepts such payment, (b) in the case of any Qualified Release Property Default, if Borrower satisfies the Release Conditions as set forth in Section 1.5, or (c) in the case of any of the foregoing Events of Default or any other Event of Default, if Lender shall execute and deliver a written agreement in which Lender expressly states that such Event of Default has ceased to continue.  Except only as expressly required by law or as to a Qualified Release Property Default in accordance with Section 1.5, Borrower shall have no right to cure any Event of Default, and Lender shall not be obligated under any circumstances whatsoever to accept such cure or performance or to execute and deliver any such writing.  Without limitation, this Section 6.3 shall govern in any case where reference is made in the Loan Documents to (i) any “cure” (whether by use of such word or otherwise) of any Event of Default, (ii) ”during an Event of Default” or “the continuance of an Event of Default” (in each case, whether by use of such words or otherwise), or (iii) any condition or event which continues beyond the time when the same becomes an Event of Default.

82

19.           Creation of Security Interest.  Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages or any of the other Loan Documents, Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages and any other Loan Document (including the advances owing to it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
 
20.           Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
21.           Set-Off.  In addition to any rights and remedies of Lender provided by this Agreement and by law, Lender has the right in its sole discretion, without prior notice to Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by Borrower to the extent permitted by Legal Requirements, upon any amount becoming due and payable by Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by Lender or any Affiliate thereof to or for the credit or the account of Borrower; provided, however, Lender may only exercise such right during the continuance of an Event of Default.  Lender agrees promptly to notify Borrower after any such set-off and application made by Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
 
22.           Lender’s Discretion; Rating Agency Review.  Whenever pursuant to this Agreement or any Loan Document (a) Lender has any right to approve or disapprove any matter, (b) Lender is entitled to make any determination, or (c) any matter is to be satisfactory to Lender, then Lender shall have the right to so approve, disapprove, determine, or be satisfied or unsatisfied, as applicable, in its sole discretion of Lender, and any such decision and shall be final and conclusive and may be conditioned upon obtaining a Rating Agency Confirmation.
 
23.           Servicer.  At the option of Lender, the Loan may be serviced by a servicer or special servicer (the “Servicer”) selected by Lender and Lender may delegate all or any portion of its responsibilities under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to the Servicer pursuant to a trust and servicing agreement or pooling and servicing agreement (the “Servicing Agreement”) governing a Secondary Market Transaction.  Borrower shall not be responsible for any set-up fees or any other initial costs relating to or arising under the Servicing Agreement.  Borrower shall not be responsible for payment of the monthly master servicing fee due to the Servicer under the Servicing Agreement.
 


  


83





  


 
25.           Usury Savings.  Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, if by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower is at any time required to pay interest on the Outstanding Principal Balance at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Interest Rate shall be deemed to be immediately reduced to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and not on account of the interest due hereunder.  All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan, shall, to the extent permitted by Legal Requirements, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not exceed the Maximum Legal Rate from time to time in effect and applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

8.           Upon thirty (30) days’ written notice, (x) increases in the amounts of coverage required hereunder as may be reasonably requested by Lender taking into consideration changes in the value of money over time, changes in liability laws, changes in prudent customs and practices and (y) such other reasonable insurance, and in such reasonable amounts as Lender from time to time may reasonably request against such other insurable hazards which at the time are commonly insured against for properties similar to the Properties located in or around the region in which Properties are located.

INTEREST RATE CAP PROVISIONS
 
1. “Interest Rate Cap Agreement” means the Confirmation and Agreement (together with the schedules relating thereto), dated on or about the Closing Date, between the Counterparty and Borrower, obtained by Borrower and collaterally assigned to Lender pursuant to this Agreement.  After delivery of a Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement to Lender, the term Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall be deemed to mean such Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement.  The Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York and shall contain each of the following:
 
(a) the notional amount of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall be equal to the maximum principal amount of the Loan;
 
(b) the remaining term of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall at all times extend through the end of the Interest Period in which the Maturity Date occurs as extended from time to time pursuant to this Agreement and the Loan Documents;
 
(c) the Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall be issued by the Counterparty to Borrower and shall be pledged to Lender by Borrower in accordance with this Agreement;
 
(d) the Counterparty under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall be obligated to make a stream of payments, directly to the Cash Management Account (whether or not an Event of Default has occurred) from time to time equal to the product of (i) the notional amount of such Interest Rate Cap Agreement multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of LIBOR (including any upward rounding under the definition of LIBOR) over the Strike Price and shall provide that such payment shall be made on a monthly basis in each case not later than (after giving effect to and assuming the passage of any cure period afforded to such Counterparty under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, which cure period shall not in any event be more than three Business Days) each Payment Date;
 
(e) the Counterparty under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall execute and deliver the Acknowledgment; and
 
(f) the Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall impose no material obligation on the beneficiary thereof (after payment of the acquisition cost) and shall be in all material respects satisfactory in form and substance to Lender and shall satisfy applicable Rating Agency standards and requirements, including provisions satisfying Rating Agencies standards, requirements and criteria (i) that incorporate customary tax “gross up” provisions, (ii) whereby the Counterparty agrees not to file or join in the filing of any petition against Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code or any other Federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency law, and (iii) that incorporate, if the Interest Rate Cap Agreement contemplates collateral posting by the Counterparty, a credit support annex setting forth the mechanics for collateral to be calculated and posted that are consistent with Rating Agency standards, requirements and criteria.
 


  


111





  


 
2. “Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement” means an interest rate cap agreement from an Approved Counterparty with terms that are the same in all material respects as the terms of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement except that the same shall be effective as of (i) in connection with a replacement pursuant to this Exhibit K, following a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the long-term unsecured debt rating of the Counterparty, the date required in this Exhibit K or (ii) in connection with a replacement (or extension of the then-existing Interest Rate Cap Agreement) in connection with an extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to Section 1.9, the date required in Section 1.9; provided that to the extent any such interest rate cap agreement does not meet the foregoing requirements, a Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall be such interest rate cap agreement approved in writing by Lender, and if the Loan or any portion thereof is included in a Secondary Market Transaction, each of the Rating Agencies with respect thereto.
 
3. “Acknowledgement” means an acknowledgement of the Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Protection Agreement, dated on or about the Closing Date, or as applicable, the applicable Maturity Date, made by Counterparty, or as applicable, Approved Counterparty, in form and substance acceptable to Lender.

5. Covenants.
 
(a) Borrower shall comply with all of its obligations under the terms and provisions of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement.  All amounts paid by the Counterparty under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement to Borrower or Lender shall be deposited immediately into the Cash Management Account pursuant to Section 5.1.1.  Subject to terms hereof, provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall be entitled to exercise all rights, powers and privileges of Borrower under, and to control the prosecution of all claims with respect to, the Interest Rate Cap Agreement and the other Rate Cap Collateral.  Borrower shall take all actions reasonably requested by Lender to enforce Borrower’s rights under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement in the event of a default by the Counterparty thereunder and shall not waive, amend or otherwise modify any of its rights thereunder.
 
(b) Borrower shall defend Lender’s right, title and interest in and to the Rate Cap Collateral pledged by Borrower pursuant hereto or in which it has granted a security interest pursuant hereto against the claims and demands of all other Persons.
 
(c) In the event of any downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the rating of the Counterparty such that it ceases to qualify as an “Approved Counterparty”, unless the Counterparty shall have posted collateral on terms acceptable to each Rating Agency, Borrower shall replace the Interest Rate Cap Agreement with a Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement not later than ten (10) Business Days following receipt of notice from Lender, Servicer or any other Person of such downgrade, withdrawal or qualification.  In the event that the Counterparty is downgraded below “BBB+” by S&P or Fitch (or, if such counterparty was an approved counterparty based on its short-term rating by S&P or Fitch, below “A-2” by S&P or “F-2” by Fitch) or below “Baa1” by Moody’s, a Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall be required regardless of the posting of collateral.
 


  


112





  


 
(d) In the event that Borrower fails to purchase and deliver to Lender the Interest Rate Cap Agreement as and when required hereunder, Lender may purchase the Interest Rate Cap Agreement and the cost incurred by Lender in purchasing the Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall be paid by Borrower to Lender with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date such cost was incurred by Lender until such cost is paid by Borrower to Lender.
 
(e) Borrower shall not sell, assign, or otherwise dispose of, or mortgage, pledge or grant a security interest in, any of the Rate Cap Collateral or any interest therein, and any sale, assignment, mortgage, pledge or security interest whatsoever made in violation of this covenant shall be a nullity and of no force and effect, and upon demand of Lender, shall forthwith be cancelled or satisfied by an appropriate instrument in writing.
 
(f) Borrower shall not (i) without the prior written consent of Lender, modify, amend or supplement the terms of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, (ii) without the prior written consent of Lender, except in accordance with the terms of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, cause the termination of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement prior to its stated maturity date, (iii) without the prior written consent of Lender, except as aforesaid, waive or release any obligation of the Counterparty (or any successor or substitute party to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement) under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, (iv) without the prior written consent of Lender, consent or agree to any act or omission to act on the part of the Counterparty (or any successor or substitute party to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement) which, without such consent or agreement, would constitute a default under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, (v) fail to exercise promptly and diligently each and every material right which it may have under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, (vi) take or intentionally omit to take any action or intentionally suffer or permit any action to be omitted or taken, the taking or omission of which would result in any right of offset against sums payable under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement or any defense by the Counterparty (or any successor or substitute party to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement) to payment or (vii) fail to give prompt notice to Lender of any notice of default given by or to Borrower under or with respect to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, together with a complete copy of such notice.  If Borrower shall have received written notice that a Secondary Market Transaction shall have occurred, no consent by Lender provided for in this Exhibit K, Section 5(f), shall be given by Lender unless Lender shall have received a Rating Agency Confirmation.
 
(g) In connection with an Interest Rate Cap Agreement, Borrower shall obtain and deliver to Lender an opinion of counsel from counsel (which counsel may be in-house counsel for the Counterparty) for the Counterparty upon which Lender and its successors and assigns may rely (the “Counterparty Opinion”), under New York law and, if the Counterparty is a non-U.S. entity, the applicable foreign law, which shall provide in relevant part, that: (i) the issuer is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has the organizational power and authority to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, the Interest Rate Cap Agreement; (ii) the execution and delivery of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement by the issuer, and any other agreement which the issuer has executed and delivered pursuant thereto, and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been and remain duly authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of its certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or equivalent organizational documents) or any law, regulation or contractual restriction binding on or affecting it or its property; (iii) all consents, authori

ch the issuer has executed and delivered pursuant thereto, and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been obtained and remain in full force and effect, all conditions thereof have been duly complied with, and no other action by, and no notice to or filing with any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for such execution, delivery or performance; and (iv) the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, and any other agreement which the issuer has executed and delivered pursuant thereto, has been duly executed and delivered by the issuer and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the issuer, enforceable against the issuer in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(d) Giving effect to the aforesaid grant and assignment to Lender, Lender has, as of the date of this Agreement, and as to Rate Cap Collateral acquired from time to time after such date, shall have, a valid, and upon proper filing, perfected and continuing first priority lien upon and security interest in the Rate Cap Collateral; provided that no representation or warranty is made with respect to the perfected status of the security interest of Lender in the proceeds of Rate Cap Collateral consisting of “cash proceeds” or “non-cash proceeds” as defined in the UCC except if, and to the extent, the provisions of Section 9-306 of the UCC shall be complied with.

(e) Except for financing statements filed or to be filed in favor of Lender as secured party, there are no financing statements under the UCC covering any or all of the Rate Cap Collateral and Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender, until payment in full of all of the Obligations, execute and file in any public office, any enforceable financing statement or statements covering any or all of the Rate Cap Collateral, except financing statements filed or to be filed in favor of Lender as secured party.
 
7. Payments.  If Borrower at any time shall be entitled to receive any payments with respect to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, such amounts shall, immediately upon becoming payable to Borrower, be deposited by Counterparty into the Cash Management Account.
 
8. Remedies. Subject to the provisions of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, if an Event of Default shall occur and then be continuing:
 
(a) Lender, without obligation to resort to any other security, right or remedy granted under any other agreement or instrument, shall have the right to, in addition to all rights, powers and remedies of a secured party pursuant to the UCC, at any time and from time to time, sell, resell, assign and deliver, in its sole discretion, any or all of the Rate Cap Collateral (in one or more parcels and at the same or different times) and all right, title and interest, claim and demand therein and right of redemption thereof, at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery, and in connection therewith Lender may grant options and may impose reasonable conditions such as requiring any purchaser to represent that any “securities” constituting any part of the Rate Cap Collateral are being purchased for investment only, Borrower hereby waiving and releasing any and all equity or right of redemption to the fullest extent permitted by the UCC or Legal Requirements.  If all or any of the Rate Cap Collateral is sold by Lender upon credit or for future delivery, Lender shall not be liable for the failure of the purchaser to purchase or pay for the same and, in the event of any such failure, Lender may resell such Rate Cap Collateral.  It is expressly agreed that Lender may exercise its rights with respect to less than all of the Rate Cap Collateral, leaving unexercised its rights with respect to the remainder of the Rate Cap Collateral, provided, however, that such partial exercise shall in no way restrict or jeopardize Lender’s right to exercise its rights with respect to all or any other portion of the Rate Cap Collateral at a later time or times.
 
(b) Lender may exercise, either by itself or by its nominee or designee, in the name of Borrower, all of Lender’s rights, powers and remedies in respect of the Rate Cap Collateral, hereunder and under law.

(c) Borrower hereby irrevocably, in the name of Borrower or otherwise, authorizes and empowers Lender and assigns and transfers unto Lender, and constitutes and appoints Lender its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, and as its agent, irrevocably, with full power of substitution for Borrower and in the name of Borrower, (i) to exercise and enforce every right, power, remedy, authority, option and privilege of Borrower under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, including any power to subordinate or modify the Interest Rate Cap Agreement (but not, unless an Event of Default exists and is continuing, the right to terminate or cancel the Interest Rate Cap Agreement), or to give any notices, or to take any action resulting in such subordination, termination, cancellation or modification and (ii) in order to more fully vest in Lender the rights and remedies provided for herein, to exercise all of the rights, remedies and powers granted to Lender in this Agreement, and Borrower further authorizes and empowers Lender, as Borrower’s attorney-in-fact, and as its agent, irrevocably, with full power of substitution for Borrower and in the name of Borrower, to give any authorization, to furnish any information, to make any demands, to execute any instruments and to take any and all other action on behalf of and in the name of Borrower which in the opinion of Lender may be necessary or appropriate to be given, furnished, made, exercised or taken under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, in order to comply therewith, to perform the conditions thereof or to prevent or remedy any default by Borrower thereunder or to enforce any of the rights of Borrower thereunder.  These powers-of-attorney are irrevocable and coupled with an interest, and any similar or dissimilar powers heretofore given by Borrower in respect of the Rate Cap Collateral to any other Person are hereby revoked.
 
(d) Lender may, without notice to, or assent by, Borrower or any other Person (to the extent permitted by law), but without affecting any of the Obligations, in the name of Borrower or in the name of Lender, notify the Counterparty, or if applicable, any other counterparty to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, to make payment and performance directly to Lender; extend the time of payment and performance of, compromise or settle for cash, credit or otherwise, and upon any terms and conditions, any obligations owing to Borrower, or claims of Borrower, under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement; file any claims, commence, maintain or discontinue any actions, suits or other proceedings deemed by Lender necessary or advisable for the purpose of collecting upon or enforcing the Interest Rate Cap Agreement; and execute any instrument and do all other things deemed necessary and proper by Lender to protect and preserve and realize upon the Rate Cap Collateral and the other rights contemplated hereby.
 
(e) Pursuant to the powers-of-attorney provided for above, Lender may take any action and exercise and execute any instrument which it may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof; provided, however, that Lender shall not be permitted to take any action pursuant to said power-of-attorney that would conflict with any limitation on Lender’s rights with respect to the Rate Cap Collateral.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Lender, after the occurrence of an Event of Default, shall have the right and power to receive, endorse and collect all checks and other orders for the payment of money made payable to Borrower representing:  (i) any payment of obligations owed pursuant to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, (ii) interest accruing on any of the Rate Cap Collateral or (iii) any other payment or distribution payable in respect of the Rate Cap Collateral or any part thereof, and for and in the name, place and stead of Borrower, to execute endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer in respect of any property which is or may become a part of the Rate Cap Collateral hereunder.
 


  


116





  


 
(f) Lender may exercise all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC.
 
(g) Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement or any of Borrower’s rights hereunder, and without waiving or releasing Borrower from any obligation or default hereunder, Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, to perform any act or take any appropriate action, as it, in its reasonable judgment, may deem necessary to protect the security of this Agreement, to cure such Event of Default or to cause any term, covenant, condition or obligation required under this Agreement or the Interest Rate Cap Agreement to be performed or observed by Borrower to be promptly performed or observed on behalf of Borrower.  All amounts advanced by, or on behalf of, Lender in exercising its rights under this Exhibit K, Section 8(g) (including, but not limited to, reasonable legal expenses and disbursements incurred in connection therewith), together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date of each such advance, shall be payable by Borrower to Lender upon demand and shall be secured by this Agreement.
 
9. Sales of Rate Cap Collateral.  No demand, advertisement or notice, all of which are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, hereby expressly waived by Borrower, shall be required in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or any part of the Rate Cap Collateral, except that Lender shall give Borrower at least thirty (30) Business Days’ prior written notice of the time and place of any public sale or of the time when and the place where any private sale or other disposition is to be made, which notice Borrower hereby agrees is reasonable, all other demands, advertisements and notices being hereby waived.  To the extent permitted by law, Lender shall not be obligated to make any sale of the Rate Cap Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale may have been given, and Lender may without notice or publication adjourn any public or private sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned.  Upon each private sale of the Rate Cap Collateral of a type customarily sold in a recognized market and upon each public sale, unless prohibited by any applicable statute which cannot be waived, Lender (or its nominee or designee) may purchase any or all of the Rate Cap Collateral being sold, free and discharged from any trusts, claims, equity or right of redemption of Borrower, all of which are hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law, and may make payment therefor by credit against any of the Obligations in lieu of cash or any other obligations.  In the case of all sales of the Rate Cap Collateral, public or private, Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind for sale or delivery, including brokers’ and attorneys’ fees and disbursements and any tax imposed thereon.  However, the proceeds of sale of Rate Cap Collateral shall be available to cover such costs and expenses, and, after deducting such costs and expenses from the proceeds of sale, Lender shall apply any residue to the payment of the Obligations in the order of priority as set forth in this Agreement.
 
10. Public Sales Not Possible. Borrower acknowledges that the terms of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement may prohibit public sales, that the Rate Cap Collateral may not be of the type appropriately sold at public sales, and that such sales may be prohibited by law.  In light of these considerations, Borrower agrees that private sales of the Rate Cap Collateral shall not be deemed to have been made in a commercially unreasonably manner by mere virtue of having been made privately.

11. Receipt of Sale Proceeds.  Upon any sale of the Rate Cap Collateral by Lender hereunder (whether by virtue of the power of sale herein granted, pursuant to judicial process or otherwise), the receipt by Lender or the officer making the sale or the proceeds of such sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Rate Cap Collateral so sold, and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to Lender or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication or non-application thereof.
 
12. Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement.  If, in connection with Borrower’s exercise of any Extension Option pursuant to Section 1.9, Borrower delivers a Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement, all the provisions of this Exhibit K applicable to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement delivered on the Closing Date shall be applicable to the Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement.
