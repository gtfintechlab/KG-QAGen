provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the -41-express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant.  To such end, all the applicable Lenders shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored.  The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation (or direct interest) in the Commitment, Loans or other Obligations owed to such other Lenders may exercise all rights of set‑off, banker’s lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of Loans in the amount of such participation.  Nothing contained herein shall require any Lender to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Lender to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of the Borrower.Section 3.4Several Obligations.No Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make a Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender hereunder, and the failure of any Lender to make a Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by it hereunder shall not relieve the obligation of any other Lender to make any Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender.Section 3.5Minimum Amounts.(a)Borrowings and Conversions.  Each borrowing of Base Rate Loans shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $250,000 in excess thereof.  Each borrowing and each Conversion of LIBOR Rate Loans shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess of that amount.(b)Prepayments.  Each voluntary prepayment of Loans shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof (or the aggregate principal amount of Loans then outstanding).Section 3.6Fees.The Borrower agrees to pay the reasonable administrative and other fees of the Agent and the Joint Lead Arrangers as agreed in the fee letters between such parties dated as of November 9, 2017 and as may be agreed to in writing from time to time.Section 3.7Computations.Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, any accrued interest on any Loan, any Fees or any other Obligations due hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days (or a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, in the case of Base Rate Loans when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate) and the actual number of days elapsed.-42-Section 3.8Usury.In no event shall the amount of interest due or payable on the Loans or other Obligations exceed the maximum rate of interest allowed by Applicable Law and, if any such payment is paid by the Borrower or received by any Lender, then such excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the Borrower shall notify the respective Lender in writing that the Borrower elects to have such excess sum returned to it forthwith.  It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the Borrower not pay and the Lenders not receive, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be lawfully paid by the Borrower under Applicable Law.Section 3.9Agreement Regarding Interest and Charges.The parties hereto hereby agree and stipulate that the only charge imposed upon the Borrower for the use of money in connection with this Agreement is and shall be the interest specifically described in Section 2.4.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto further agree and stipulate that all agency fees, syndication fees, arrangement fees, amendment fees, up‑front fees, closing fees, underwriting fees, default charges, late charges, funding or “breakage” charges, increased cost charges, attorneys’ fees and reimbursement for costs and expenses paid by the Agent or any Lender to third parties or for damages incurred by the Agent or any Lender, or any other similar amounts are charges made to compensate the Agent or any such Lender for underwriting or administrative services and costs or losses performed or incurred, and to be performed or incurred, by the Agent and the Lenders in connection with this Agreement and shall under no circumstances be deemed to be charges for the use of money.  The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Lenders have imposed no minimum borrowing requirements, reserve or escrow balances or compensating balances related in any way to the Obligations.  Any use by the Borrower of certificates of deposit issued by any Lender or other accounts maintained with any Lender has been and shall be voluntary on the part of the Borrower.  All charges other than charges for the use of money shall be fully earned and nonrefundable when due.Section 3.10Statements of Account.The Agent will account to the Borrower monthly with a statement of Loans, accrued interest and Fees, charges and payments made pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and such account rendered by the Agent shall be deemed conclusive upon the Borrower absent manifest error.  The failure of the Agent to deliver such a statement of accounts shall not relieve or discharge the Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder.Section 3.11Defaulting Lenders.Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the Commitment and outstanding principal amount of Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Requisite Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 12.6), provided that any waiver, amendment or modification that increases the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender, forgives all or any portion of the principal -43-amount of any Loan or interest thereon owing to a Defaulting Lender, reduces the Applicable Margin on the underlying interest rate options owing to a Defaulting Lender or extends the Maturity Date (except as provided in Section 2.13) shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.Section 3.12Taxes.(a)Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.(b)Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.  The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Agent timely reimburse it or any Lender for the payment of, any Other Taxes.(c)Indemnification by the Borrower.  The Borrower shall  indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after Borrower’s receipt of written notice of demand therefor together with a certificate specifying the amount of such payment or liability (which shall be conclusive absent manifest error) and the calculation thereof in reasonable detail, unless such calculation would require the Recipient to disclose confidential or proprietary information (with a copy to the Agent), for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.(d)Indemnification by the Lenders.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.5(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan -44-Document or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this paragraph (d).(e)Evidence of Payments.  Within a reasonable time after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.12, the Borrower shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.(f)Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.12(f) (ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.(ii)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person,(A)any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), an executed IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;(B)any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:(1)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, an executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W--45-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;(2)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming that its extension of credit would generate U.S. effectively connected income, an executed IRS Form W-8ECI;(3)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) an executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or(4)to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, an executed IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-2 or Exhibit L-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;(C)any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and(D)if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold -46-from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.(g)Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.12 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.12), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 3.12 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party in connection with obtaining such refund and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the

Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) to the extent the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid and the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to, or to file for or pursue any refund of Taxes on behalf of, the indemnifying party or any other Person.(h)Survival.  Each party’s obligations under this Section 3.12 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.ARTICLE 4YIELD PROTECTION, ETC.Section 4.1Increased Costs.(a)If any Regulatory Change shall:(i)impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, liquidity or similar requirement (including any compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate);-47-(ii)impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender; or(iii)subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, continuing, converting or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.(b)If any Lender determines that any Regulatory Change regarding capital or liquidity ratios or requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.(c)A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.(d)Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Regulatory Change giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.-48-Section 4.2Alternate Rate of Interest.(a)If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBOR Rate Loan:(i)the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Base Rate or the LIBOR Rate, as applicable (including, without limitation, because the LIBOR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis), for such Interest Period; or(ii)the Agent is advised by the Requisite Lenders that the LIBOR Base Rate or the LIBOR Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such borrowing for such Interest Period;then the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (A) any Notice of Continuation or Notice of Conversion that requests the conversion of any borrowing to, or continuation of any borrowing as, a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be ineffective and (B) if any Notice of Borrowing requests a borrowing of LIBOR Rate Loans, such borrowing shall be made as a borrowing of Base Rate Loans.(b)If at any time the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i) the circumstances set forth in clause (a)(i) have arisen and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or (ii) the circumstances set forth in clause (a)(i) have not arisen but the supervisor for the administrator of the LIBOR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the LIBOR Screen Rate shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, then the Agent and the Borrower shall endeavor to establish an alternate rate of interest to the LIBOR Base Rate that gives due consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States at such time, and shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate rate of interest and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be applicable (but for the avoidance of doubt, such related changes shall not include a reduction of the Applicable Margin).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12.6, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of the date notice of such alternate rate of interest is provided to the Lenders, a written notice from the Requisite Lenders stating that such Requisite Lenders object to such amendment.  Until an alternate rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with this clause (b) (but, in the case of the circumstances described in clause (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 4.2(b), only to the extent the LIBOR Screen Rate for such Interest Period is not available or published at such time on a current basis), (x) any Notice of Continuation or Notice of Conversion that requests the conversion of any borrowing to, or continuation of any borrowing as, a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be ineffective and (y) if any Notice of Borrowing requests a borrowing of LIBOR Rate Loans, such borrowing shall be made as a borrowing of Base Rate Loans; provided that, if such alternate rate of interest shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement.-49-Section 4.3Illegality.Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if it becomes unlawful for any Lender to honor its obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof (with a copy to the Agent) and such Lender’s obligation to make or Continue, or to Convert Loans of any other Type into, LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain LIBOR Rate Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 4.6 shall be applicable).Section 4.4Compensation.The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender, within five (5) Business Days following the request of such Lender through the Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense that such Lender determines is attributable to:(a)any payment or prepayment (whether mandatory or optional) of a LIBOR Rate Loan, or Conversion of a LIBOR Rate Loan, made by such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, acceleration) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or(b)any failure by the Borrower for any reason (including, without limitation, the failure of any of the applicable conditions precedent specified in Article V to be satisfied) to borrow a LIBOR Rate Loan from such Lender on the date for such borrowing, or to Convert a Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Rate Loan or Continue a LIBOR Rate Loan on the requested date of such Conversion or Continuation.Upon the Borrower’s request, any Lender requesting compensation under this Section shall provide the Borrower with a statement setting forth the basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining the amount thereof.  Each Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods generally applied by such Lender and may include, without limitation, administrative costs as a component of such loss, cost or expense.  Absent manifest error, determinations by any Lender in any such statement shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis and in good faith.Section 4.5Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.(a)If any Lender requests compensation under Section 4.1, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.12, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 4.1 or 3.12, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.-50-(b)If (w) any Lender requests compensation under Section 4.1, or (x) the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.12, or (y) any Lender becomes Defaulting Lender, or (z) any Lender has refused to consent to any proposed amendment, modification, waiver, termination or consent with respect to any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that, pursuant to Section 12.6, requires the consent of all Lenders or each Lender affected thereby and with respect to which Lenders constituting the Requisite Lenders have consented to such proposed amendment, modification, waiver, termination or consent, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 12.5), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 4.1 or 3.12) and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 4.1 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.12, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments, and (iv) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a Lender’s refusal to consent to a proposed amendment, modification, waiver, termination or consent, the assignee shall approve the proposed amendment, modification, waiver, termination or consent.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent: (a) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the Agent receives written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof signed by such payee and in form satisfactory to the Agent; (b) may consult with legal counsel (including its own counsel or counsel for the Borrower or any other Obligor), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (c) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender or any other Person and shall not be responsible to any Lender or any other Person for any statements, warranties or representations made by any Person in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (d) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of any of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the satisfaction of any conditions precedent under this Agreement or any Loan Document on the part of the Borrower or other Persons or inspect the property, books or records of the Borrower or any other Person; (e) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto or any collateral covered thereby or the perfection or priority of any Lien in favor of the Agent on behalf of the Lenders in any such collateral; (f) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telephone or telecopy) believed by it to be genuine and signed, sent or given by the proper party or parties; and (g) except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower, the REIT Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.Section 11.3Notice of Defaults.The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest -84-and fees required to be paid to Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing with reasonable specificity such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.”  If any Lender (excluding the Lender which is also serving as the Agent) becomes aware of any Default or Event of Default, it shall promptly send to the Agent such a “notice of default.”  Further, if the Agent receives such a “notice of default”, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.Section 11.4JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Lender.JPMCB, as a Lender, shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and any other Loan Document as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent; and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include JPMCB in each case in its individual capacity.  JPMCB and its affiliates may each accept deposits from, maintain deposits or credit balances for, invest in, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, serve as financial advisor to, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower, any other Obligor or any other affiliate thereof as if it were any other bank and without any duty to account therefor to the other Lenders.

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Lender or counsel to the Agent, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and based on the financial statements of the Borrower, the other Obligors, and their respective Subsidiaries, or any other Affiliate thereof, and inquiries of such Persons, its independent due diligence of the business and affairs of the Borrower, the Obligors, their respective Subsidiaries and other Persons, its review of the Loan Documents, the legal opinions required to be delivered to it hereunder, the advice of its own counsel and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit and legal analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Lender or counsel to the Agent or any of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and based on such review, advice, documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under the Loan Documents.  Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall -85-have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower, any other Obligor, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any other Affiliate thereof which may come into possession of the Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or other Affiliates.  Each Lender acknowledges that the Agent’s legal counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is only acting as counsel to the Agent and is not acting as counsel to such Lender.Section 11.7Indemnification of Agent.Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) pro rata in accordance with such Lender’s respective Prorata Share, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent (in its capacity as Agent but not as a Lender) in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents, any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under the Loan Documents (collectively, “Indemnifiable Amounts”); provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such Indemnifiable Amounts to the extent resulting from the following, in each case as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision: (a) the Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct or (b) the Agent’s failure to follow the written direction of the Requisite Lenders unless such failure is pursuant to the reasonable advice of counsel of which the Lenders have received notice.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing but subject to the preceding provision, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees of the counsel(s) of the Agent’s own choosing) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, administration or enforcement of, or legal advice with respect to the rights or responsibilities of the parties under, the Loan Documents, any suit or action brought by the Agent to enforce the terms of the Loan Documents and/or collect any Obligations, any “lender liability” suit or claim brought against the Agent and/or the Lenders, and any claim or suit brought against the Agent and/or the Lenders arising under any Environmental Laws.  Such out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) shall be advanced by the Lenders on the request of the Agent notwithstanding any claim or assertion that the Agent is not entitled to indemnification hereunder upon receipt of an undertaking by the Agent that the Agent will reimburse the Lenders if it is actually and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Agent is not so entitled to indemnification.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and the termination of this Agreement.  If the Borrower shall reimburse the Agent for any Indemnifiable Amount following payment by any Lender to the Agent in respect of such Indemnifiable Amount pursuant to this Section, the Agent shall share such reimbursement on a ratable basis with each Lender making any such payment.-86-Section 11.8Successor Agent.The Agent may resign at any time as Agent under the Loan Documents by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower.  The Agent may be removed as Agent under the Loan Documents by the Requisite Lenders (other than the Lender then acting as Agent) as a result of (i) its gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision) or (ii) it being a Defaulting Lender or meeting the criteria of a Defaulting Lender.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Requisite Lenders (other than the Lender then acting as Agent, in the case of the removal of the Agent under the immediately preceding sentence) shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a Lender, if any Lender shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be a commercial bank having total combined assets of at least $5,000,000,000, which appointment shall, provided no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, be subject to the Borrower’s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (except that the Borrower shall, in all events, be deemed to have approved each Lender (and its affiliates) holding at least ten percent (10%) of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Loans and unused Commitments (calculated at the time Agent gives notice of its resignation) as a successor Agent).  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and shall have accepted such appointment, within thirty (30) days after the resigning Agent’s giving of notice of resignation or the Lenders’ removal of the resigning Agent, then the resigning or removed Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a Lender, if any Lender shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be a commercial bank having total combined assets of at least $5,000,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents as Agent.  After any Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article XI and all provisions of this Agreement shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under the Loan Documents.Section 11.9Titled Agents.Each of the Titled Agents in each such respective capacity, assumes no responsibility or obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, for servicing enforcement or collection of any of the Loans, nor any duties as an agent hereunder for the Lenders.  The titles of “Lead Arranger”, “Bookrunner”, and “Documentation Agent” are solely honorific and imply no fiduciary responsibility on the part of the Titled Agents to the Agent, the Borrower or any Lender and the use of such titles does not impose on the Titled Agents any duties or obligations greater than those of any other Lender or entitle the Titled Agents to any rights other than those to which any other Lender is entitled.Section 11.10Other Loans by Lenders to Obligors.(a)    The Lenders agree that one or more of them may now or hereafter have other loans to and derivative contracts and/or business arrangements with one or more of the Obligors which are not subject to this Agreement.  The Lenders agree that the Lender(s) which may have -87-such other loan(s) to the Obligors may collect payments on such loan(s) and may secure such loan(s) (so long as such loan does not itself expressly violate this Agreement).  Further, the Lenders agree that the Lender(s) which may have such other loan(s) to the Obligors shall have no obligation to attempt to collect payments under the Loans in preference and priority over the collection and/or enforcement of such other loan(s).(b)    As described above, certain of the Lenders have outstanding loans to the Borrower as more fully described in items 1, 2, and 3 on Schedule 6.1(g) (the “Other Unsecured Loan Facilities”). The Other Unsecured Loan Facilities have covenants and provisions substantially similar to the covenants contained in Section 9.5(c) (the “Restrictive Provisions”). It was the intent of the Lenders, in their capacity as “Lenders” under and as defined in the Other Unsecured Loan Facilities that the Restrictive Provisions not restrict the ability the Borrower or the REIT Guarantor from (i) making any dividends or distributions (as such restrictions on dividends and distributions by the Borrower and the REIT Guarantor are set forth in Section 9.6) or (ii) entering into other agreements that restrict the ability of the Borrower or the REIT Guarantor to make any dividends or distributions. As such, for the avoidance of doubt, each of the Lenders hereto, in their capacity as a “Lender” under the Other Unsecured Loan Facilities, hereby agree, for themselves and their successors and assigns, that (x) the Restrictive Provisions contained in any of the Other Unsecured Loan Facilities shall not (1) restrict the ability of Borrower or the REIT Guarantor to make any dividends or distributions or (2) restrict the ability the Borrower or the REIT Guarantor from entering into other agreements that restrict the ability of the Borrower or the REIT Guarantor to make any dividends or distributions, and (y) the Restrictive Provisions shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, be deemed to conflict with this Agreement or any of the Other Unsecured Loan Facilities and Section 9.6 of this Agreement shall not be deemed to conflict with the Other Unsecured Loan Facilities. The acknowledgements and agreements under this Section 11.10 shall survive termination of this Agreement.ARTICLE 12MISCELLANEOUS    Section 12.1Notices.Unless otherwise provided herein, communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed, telecopied or delivered by hand or by nationally-recognized overnight courier as follows:If to the Borrower:Columbia Property Trust Operating Partnership, L.P.One Glenlake Parkway, Suite 1200Atlanta Georgia  30328-7267Attention:  Chief Financial OfficerTelecopy Number:    (404) 465-2201Telephone Number:    (404) 465-2126-88-With a copy to:King & Spalding LLP1180 Peachtree Street, NEAtlanta, GA  30309Attention:  J.

In no event shall the Agent or any of its Affiliates or directors, officers, employees or agents (collectively, the “Agent Parties”) have any liability to the Borrower or the other Obligors, any Lender, or any other Person or entity for damages of any kind, including, without limitation, direct or indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrower’s, any Obligor’s or the Agent’s transmission of communications through an Electronic System other than as a result of willful misconduct or gross negligence by such Person as determined by a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. “Communications” means, collectively, any notice, demand, communication, information, document or other material provided by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Obligor pursuant to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated therein which is distributed by the Agent or any Lender by means of electronic communications pursuant to this Section, including through an Electronic System.-90-Section 12.2Expenses.The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse the Agent for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, administration and interpretation of, and any amendment, supplement or modification to, or waiver of, any of the Loan Documents (including due diligence expenses and travel expenses relating to closing), and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Agent (such expenses to include ongoing charges for Intralinks, SyndTrak Online or any similar system), (b) to pay or reimburse JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the initial syndication of the Loans by it, (c) to pay or reimburse the Agent and the Lenders for all their costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights or any “work-out” under the Loan Documents, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of their respective counsel (including the allocated fees and expenses of in-house counsel) and any payments in indemnification or otherwise payable by the Lenders to the Agent pursuant to the Loan Documents, (d) to pay, and indemnify and hold harmless the Agent and the Lenders from, any and all recording and filing fees and any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any failure to pay or delay in paying, documentary, stamp, excise and other similar taxes, if any, which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of any of the Loan Documents, or consummation of any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, any Loan Document, and (e) to the extent not already covered by any of the preceding subsections, to pay or reimburse the Agent and the Lenders for all their costs and expenses incurred in connection with any bankruptcy or other proceeding of the type described in Sections 10.1(f) or 10.1(g), including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Agent and any Lender, whether such fees and expenses are incurred prior to, during or after the commencement of such proceeding or the confirmation or conclusion of any such proceeding.

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents of each of the Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.(b)Any Lender may make, carry or transfer Loans at, to or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of an affiliate of such Lender except to the extent such transfer would result in increased costs to the Borrower.(c)Except as set forth in Section 12.5(h), any Lender may at any time grant to one or more banks or other financial institutions (each a “Participant”) participating interests in its Commitment or the Obligations owing to such Lender; provided, however, (i) any such participating interest must be for a constant and not a varying percentage interest, (ii) no Lender may grant a participating interest in its Commitment, or if the Commitments have been terminated, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of Loans held by it, in an amount less than $1,000,000 and (iii) after giving effect to any such participation by a Lender, the amount of its Commitment or if the Commitments have been terminated, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of Loans held by it, in which it has not granted any participating interests must be equal to $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  No Participant shall have any rights or benefits under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.  In the event of any such grant by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, such Lender shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement pursuant to which any Lender may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this -93-Agreement; provided, however, such Lender may agree with the Participant that it will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to (i) increase, or extend the term or extend the time or waive any requirement for the reduction or termination of, such Lender’s Commitment, (ii) extend the date fixed for the payment of principal of or interest on the Loans or portions thereof owing to such Lender, (iii) reduce the amount of any such payment of principal, (iv) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon or (v) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors (except as otherwise permitted under Section 7.12(b)).

The selling Lender shall notify the Agent and the Borrower of the sale of any participation hereunder.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.12, 4.1 and 4.4 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section; provided that (a) a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.12 and 4.1 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent and (b) a Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.12 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower and the Agent, to comply with Section 3.12(f) as though it were a Lender.  To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.3 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.3 as though it were a Lender.Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Commitment, Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.(d)Except as set forth in Section 12.5(h), any Lender may with the prior written consent of the Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), assign to one or more Eligible Assignees (each an “Assignee”) all or a portion of its Commitment and Loan and its other rights and obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, (i) no such consent by the Agent shall be required in the case of any assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund of a Lender unless such Lender is a Defaulting Lender; (ii) any partial assignment shall be in an amount at least equal to $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and after giving effect to such partial assignment the assigning -94-Lender retains a portion of the unused Commitment and Loan so assigned having an aggregate outstanding principal balance, of at least $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (provided, however, the conditions set forth in this subsection (ii) shall not apply to any full assignment by any Lender of its unused Commitment and Loan ); and (iii) each such assignment shall be effected by means of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof in the Register, upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Lender of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Lender and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be deemed to be a Lender party to this Agreement as of the effective date of the Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender with a Commitment and Loan amount as set forth in such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, and the transferor Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required.  Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection (d), the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes are issued to the Assignee and such transferor Lender, as appropriate, and any other documents reasonably required by a Lender in connection with such assignment shall be executed by the Borrower.  In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Lender shall pay to the Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500.(e)The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Principal Office a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time (the “Register”).  The Agent shall give each Lender and the Borrower notice of the assignment by any Lender of its rights as contemplated by this Section.  The Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register and copies of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice to the Agent.  Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement executed by an assigning Lender, together with each Note subject to such assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement has been completed and if the Agent receives the processing and recording fee described in Section 12.5(d) above, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower.(f)In addition to the assignments and participations permitted under the foregoing provisions of this Section, any Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans and its Notes to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central reserve bank having jurisdiction over such Lender.  No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.(g)A Lender may furnish any information concerning the Borrower, any other Obligor or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in the possession of such Lender from time to time to Assignees and Participants (including prospective Assignees and Participants) subject to compliance with Section 12.8.-95-(h)Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or participate any interest in any Loan held by it hereunder to (i) the Borrower, any other Obligor or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (ii) a Defaulting Lender or (iii) a natural person.(i)Each Lender agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Agent, it will not make any assignment hereunder in any manner or under any circumstances that would require registration or qualification of, or filings in respect of, any Loan or Note under the Securities Act or any other securities laws of the United States of America or of any other jurisdiction.Section 12.6Amendments.Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (including Section 4.2(b)), any consent or approval required or permitted by this Agreement or any other Loan Document to be given by the Lenders may be given, and any term of this Agreement or of any other Loan Document may be amended, and the performance or observance by the Borrower or any other Obligor or any of their respective Subsidiaries of any terms of this Agreement or such other Loan Document or the continuance of any Default or Event of Default may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with, but only with, the written consent of the Requisite Lenders (and, in the case of an amendment to any Loan Document, the written consent of the Borrower).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, waiver or consent shall do any of the following: (i) increase or extend the Commitments (or any component thereof) of any of Lenders (except as contemplated by Section 2.11) without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby; (ii) reduce the principal of, or interest rates that have accrued or that will be charged on the outstanding principal amount of, any Loans or Fees or other Obligations without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby; (iii) reduce the amount of any Fees payable hereunder without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby; (iv) except as provided in Section 2.13, postpone any date fixed for any payment of any principal of, or interest on, any Loans or any other Obligations without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby; (v) (A) change the Commitment Percentages or Prorata Share (or any component thereof) (except as a result of any increase or decrease in the aggregate amount of the Commitments contemplated by Section 2.11 or Section 4.5 or as a result of any reallocation contemplated by Section 3.11) without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby or (B) amend or otherwise modify the provisions of Section 3.2(a) without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby; (vi)  modify the definition of the term “Requisite Lenders”, modify in any other manner the number or percentage of the Lenders (including all of the Lenders) required to make any determinations or waive any rights hereunder or to modify any provision hereof, including without limitation, any modification of this Section 12.6 if such modification would have such effect without the written consent of each Lender; or (vii) release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty (except as otherwise permitted under Section 7.12(b)) without the written consent of each Lender.  Further, no amendment, waiver or consent unless in writing and signed by the Agent, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action, shall affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.  No waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or impair any right consequent thereon and any amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose set forth therein.  No course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of the Agent or any Lender -96-in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial thereto.  Except as otherwise explicitly provided for herein or in any other Loan Document, no notice to or demand upon the Borrower shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.Section 12.7No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility.    In connection with all aspects of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates’ understanding, that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Agent, the Joint Lead Arrangers, and the Lenders are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Agent, the Joint Lead Arrangers, and the Lenders, on the other hand, (B) the Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) the Agent, each Joint Lead Arranger and each Lender is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) neither the Agent, any Joint Lead Arranger nor any Lender has any obligation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Agent, the Joint Lead Arrangers and the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and neither the Agent, any Joint Lead Arranger, nor any Lender has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or its Affiliates.  The Borrower agrees that it will not assert any claim against the Agent, the Joint Lead Arrangers or the Lenders based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by such Person in connection with this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby.Section 12.8Confidentiality.(a)Each of the Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates’ directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii)  any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower, (h) on a confidential basis to -97-any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or the loans under this Agreement, or (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower; provided that the source of such information was not known by the Agent or any Lender to be bound by a confidentiality agreement or other legal or contractual obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information.  For the purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower and other than information pertaining to this Agreement routinely provided by arrangers to market data collectors and data service providers, including league table providers, that serve the lending industry.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.  In addition, the Agent and each Lender may disclose the existence of this Agreement and the information about this Agreement to service providers to the Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.(b)EACH LENDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT INFORMATION AS DEFINED IN SECTION 9.12(a) FURNISHED TO IT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY INCLUDE MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION CONCERNING THE BORROWER AND  ITS RELATED PARTIES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE SECURITIES, AND CONFIRMS THAT IT HAS DEVELOPED COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES REGARDING THE USE OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION AND THAT IT WILL HANDLE SUCH MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE PROCEDURES AND APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS.(c)ALL INFORMATION, INCLUDING REQUESTS FOR WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS, FURNISHED BY THE BORROWER OR THE AGENT PURSUANT TO, OR IN THE COURSE OF ADMINISTERING, THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE SYNDICATE-LEVEL INFORMATION, WHICH MAY CONTAIN MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE BORROWER AND ITS RELATED PARTIES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE SECURITIES.  ACCORDINGLY, EACH LENDER REPRESENTS TO THE BORROWER AND THE AGENT THAT IT HAS IDENTIFIED IN ITS ADMINISTRATIVE QUESTIONNAIRE A CREDIT CONTACT WHO MAY RECEIVE INFORMATION THAT MAY CONTAIN MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES AND APPLICABLE LAW.Section 12.9Indemnification.(a)Borrower shall and hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Agent, each of the Lenders, their respective Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, shareholders, agents, advisors, employees and counsel (each referred to herein as an “Indemnified Party”) from and against any and all losses, costs, claims, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, judgments or expenses of every kind and nature (including, without limitation, -98-amounts paid in settlement, court costs and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any litigation, investigation, claim or proceeding or any advice rendered in connection therewith, but excluding losses, costs, claims, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, judgments or expenses indemnification in respect of which is specifically covered by Section 3.12 or 4.1 or expressly excluded from the coverage of such Sections) incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection with, arising out of, or by reason of, any loss, liability, suit, cause of action, claim, arbitration, investigation or settlement, consent decree or other proceeding (the foregoing referred to herein as an “Indemnity Proceeding”) which is in any way related directly or indirectly to: (i) this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) the making of any Loans hereunder; (iii) any actual or proposed use by the Borrower of the proceeds of the Loans; (iv) the Agent’s or any Lender’s entering into this Agreement; (v) the fact that the Agent and the Lenders have established the credit facility evidenced hereby in favor of the Borrower; (vi) the fact that the Agent and the Lenders are creditors of the Borrower and have or are alleged to have information regarding the financial condition, strategic plans or business operations of the Borrower, the other Obligors, or their respective Subsidiaries; (vii) the fact that the Agent and the Lenders are material creditors of the Borrower and are alleged to influence directly or indirectly the business decisions or affairs of the Borrower, the other Obligors and their respective Subsidiaries or their financial condition; (viii) the exercise of any right or remedy the Agent or the Lenders may have under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; or (ix) any violation or non-compliance by the Borrower, any other Obligor, or any of their respective Subsidiaries of any Applicable Law (including any Environmental Law) including, but not limited to, any Indemnity Proceeding commenced by (A) the Internal Revenue Service or state taxing authority or (B) any Governmental Authority or other Person under any Environmental Law, including any Indemnity Proceeding commenced by a Governmental Authority or other Person seeking remedial or other action to cause the Borrower, the Obligors or their respective Subsidiaries (or their respective properties) (or the Agent and/or the Lenders as successors to the Borrower, any other Obligor or their respective Subsidiaries) to be in compliance with such Environmental Laws; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party (x) for any acts or omissions of such Indemnified Party that constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision, or (y) in connection with any losses, costs, claims, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, judgments or expenses arising out of any action, claim, arbitration, investigation or settlement, consent decree or other proceeding brought by any Indemnified Party against any other Indemnified Party in connection with, arising out of, or by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated thereby or the making of any Loans hereunder (but not arising as a result of any act or omission by the Borrower or any Guarantor).
