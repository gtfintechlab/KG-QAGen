If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans hereunder requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as Base Rate Loans, (y) any Term Loans hereunder that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as Base Rate Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans hereunder shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to Base Rate Loans; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice shall cease or otherwise become inapplicable to such Required Lenders, then such Required Lenders shall promptly give notice of such change in circumstances to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower.

Upon receipt of any such notice of prepayment, the Administrative Agent shall notify each relevant Lender thereof on the date of receipt of such notice.  If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with (except in the case of prepayments of Term Loans maintained as Base Rate Loans) accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid.  Partial prepayments shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the then outstanding principal amount of Term Loans).  The application of any prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.13(a) shall be made, first, to Base Rate Loans of the respective Lenders (and of the respective tranche, if there are multiple tranches) and, second, to Eurodollar Loans of the respective Lenders (and of the respective tranche, if there are multiple tranches).  Any prepayments of the Term Loan pursuant to this Section 2.13(a) shall be applied to the remaining scheduled installments of the Term Loans as directed by the Borrower.  A notice of prepayment of all outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.13(a) may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities the proceeds of which will be used to refinance in full this Agreement, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.(b)    At the time of the effectiveness of any Repricing Transaction that (x) results in any prepayment of Term Loans, or (y) effects any amendment of this Agreement resulting in a Repricing Transaction and (in either case) is consummated prior to August 3, 2017, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each applicable Lender, a fee in an amount equal to, without duplication, (I) in the case of clause (x), a prepayment premium of 1% of the principal amount of the Term Loans being prepaid and (II) in the case of clause (y), a payment equal to 1% of the aggregate amount of the applicable Term Loans outstanding immediately prior to such amendment and subject to such Repricing Transaction.  Such fees shall be due and payable upon the date of the effectiveness of such Repricing Transaction.-31-        2.14.    Change of Control Prepayment.  If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, the Borrower shall make an offer to prepay the entire principal amount of the Term Loans (the “Change of Control Prepayment Offer”) at 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof and the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of the Change of Control Prepayment Offer in writing within thirty (30) days after the date of such Change of Control Triggering Event. Each such notice shall specify the date of such prepayment and provide a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment and include the payment date, which shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date of such notice is mailed (the “Change of Control Payment Date”).  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of the contents of any such prepayment notice and of such Lender’s pro rata share of the prepayment.  Any Lender may elect, by delivering not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, a written notice (such notice, an “Acceptance Notice”) that any change of control prepayment be made with respect to all or any portion of the Term Loans held by such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14.  If a Lender fails to deliver an Acceptance Notice within the time frame specified above, any such failure will be deemed a rejection of the Change of Control Prepayment Offer as to all outstanding Term Loans of such Lender.  Any prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall be applied to the remaining scheduled installments of the Term Loans as directed by the Borrower2.15.    Conversion and Continuation Options.(a)    The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to Base Rate Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit F, of such election no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date; provided that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto.  The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the third (3rd) Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date (which notice shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor); provided that no Base Rate Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversions.  Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof.(b)    Any Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit F, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term “Interest Period” set forth in Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Term Loans; provided that no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuations; and provided further that if the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period.  Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof.2.16.    Limitations on Eurodollar Tranches.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and continuations of Eurodollar Loans and all selections of Interest Periods shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that no more than ten different Interest Periods for any tranche of Term Loans be outstanding at any one time (unless a greater number of Interest Periods is permitted by the Administrative Agent).2.17.    Pro Rata Treatment, etc.(a)    Except as otherwise provided herein (including Section 2.27), each borrowing by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder shall be made pro rata according to the Term Percentages of the relevant Lenders.    -32-        (b)    Except as otherwise provided herein (including Sections 2.14, 2.27 and 2.28), each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal or interest on the Term Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Term Loans then held by the Lenders.(c)    All payments by the Borrower hereunder and under the Notes shall be made in Dollars in immediately available funds at the Funding Office of the Administrative Agent by 2:00 P.M., New York City time, on the date on which such payment shall be due, provided that if any payment hereunder would become due and payable on a day other than a Business Day such payment shall become due and payable on the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.  Interest in respect of any Term Loan hereunder shall accrue from and including the date of such Term Loan to but excluding the date on which such Term Loan is paid in full.(d)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a Borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent.  A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  If such Lender’s share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans under this Agreement, on demand, from the Borrower, such recovery to be without prejudice to the rights of the Borrower against any such Lender.(e)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective pro rata shares of a corresponding amount.  If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.(f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.17 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Borrower may extend the final maturity of Term Loans in connection with an Extension that is permitted under Section 2.27 without being obligated to effect such extensions on a pro rata basis among the Lenders.  Furthermore, the Borrower may take all actions contemplated by Section 2.27 in connection with any Extension (including modifying pricing and repayments or prepayments), and in each case such actions shall be permitted, and the differing payments contemplated therein shall be permitted without giving rise to any violation of this Section 2.17 or any other provision of this Agreement.-33-        2.18.    Requirements of Law.(a)    If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority, in each case, made subsequent to the Closing Date (including, but not limited to, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision or United States regulatory authorities, in each case, as pursuant to Basel III and, in each case, all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith):(i)    shall subject any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any Eurodollar Loan made by it (except for Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 2.19 and any Excluded Taxes payable by such Lender);(ii)    shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate; or(iii)    shall impose on any such Lender any other condition;and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable.  If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled. No Lender shall request that the Borrower pay any additional amount pursuant to this Section 2.18(a) unless such Lender has or is generally seeking compensation from similarly situated borrowers. (b)    If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the Closing Date shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such corporation’s capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such corporation’s policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.(c)    A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.18, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.18 for any amounts incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such 180 days period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect.  The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.18 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Term Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.-34-        2.19.    Taxes.(a)    Unless required by applicable law (as determined in good faith by the applicable withholding agent), all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes, excluding (i) Taxes imposed on or measured by overall net income (however denominated), gross receipts Taxes (imposed in lieu of net income Taxes) and franchise Taxes (imposed in lieu of net income Taxes) imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of such recipient (A) being organized or having its principal office in the applicable taxing jurisdiction, or in the case of any Lender, having its applicable lending office in such jurisdiction, or (B) having any other present or former connection with the applicable taxing jurisdiction (other than any such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered, become a party to, or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, and/or engaged in any activities contemplated with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document); (ii) any Taxes in the nature of the branch profits tax within the meaning of Section 884 of the Code imposed by any jurisdiction described in clause (i) above; (iii) other than in the case of an assignee pursuant to a request by the Borrower under Section 2.26 hereof, any U.S. federal withholding tax except (A) to the extent such withholding tax results from a change in a Requirement of Law after the recipient became a party hereto or (B) to the extent that such recipient's assignor (if any) was entitled immediately prior to such assignment to receive additional amounts from any Loan Party with respect to such withholding tax pursuant to this Section 2.19(a); (iv) any withholding Tax that is attributable to the recipient’s failure to comply with Section 2.19(e) hereof; and (v) any withholding Taxes imposed pursuant to FATCA.  If any Taxes are required by law to be withheld by the applicable withholding agent from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, or under any other Loan Document: (x) to the extent such Taxes are Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes, the amounts so payable by the applicable Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary so that after all required deductions (including deductions of Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.19) have been made, the Lender (or, in the case of any payment made to the Administrative Agent for its own account, the Administrative Agent) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made, (y) the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions, and (z) the applicable withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.19(a) or Section 2.19(b), unless the Administrative Agent or a Lender gives notice to the applicable Loan Party that it is obligated to pay an amount under Section 2.19(a) or Section 2.19(b) within 180 days of the later of (x) the date the applicable party incurs the Taxes or (y) the date the applicable party has knowledge of its incurrence of the Taxes, then such party shall only be entitled to be compensated for such amount by the applicable Loan Party pursuant to Section 2.19(a) or Section 2.19(b) to the extent the Taxes are incurred or suffered on or after the date which occurs 180 days prior to such party giving notice to the applicable Loan Party that it is obligated to pay the respective amounts pursuant to Section 2.19(a) or Section 2.19(b), but if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect (e.g., in connection with the audit of a prior tax year), then such 180 day period shall be extended to include such period of retroactive effect.(b)    In addition, the relevant Loan Party shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.(c)    Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by a Loan Party, as promptly as possible thereafter such Loan Party shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received, if any, by the Borrower or other documentary evidence showing payment thereof.  (d)    The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender (within 30 days after demand therefor) for the full amount of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes (including Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.19), and for any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, whether or not such Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority; provided that the Borrower shall not -35-        be obligated to indemnify the Administrative Agent or any Lender for any penalties, interest or expenses relating to Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes to the extent that such penalties, interest or expenses are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (e)    Each Lender shall, at such times as are reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with any documentation prescribed by law, or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, certifying as to any entitlement of such Lender to an exemption from, or reduction in, any withholding Tax with respect to any payments to be made to such Lender under the Loan Documents.  Each such Lender shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders any such documentation (including any documentation specifically referenced below) expired, obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, or upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, deliver promptly to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by the applicable withholding agent) or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its legal ineligibility to do so.  Unless the applicable withholding agent has received forms or other documents satisfactory to it indicating that payments under any Loan Document to or for a Lender are not subject to withholding tax or are subject to such Tax at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, the Borrower, Administrative Agent or other applicable withholding agent shall withhold amounts required to be withheld by applicable law from such payments at the applicable statutory rate. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Borrower and to any successor Administrative Agent any documentation provided to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.19(e).Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:(i)Each Lender that is a “United States person” (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding.(ii)Each Lender that is not a “United States person” (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement whichever of the following is applicable:(A)two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or any successor forms) claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States of America is a party,(B)two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any successor forms),(C)    in the case of a Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate, in substantially the form of Exhibit E (any such certificate a “United States Tax Compliance Certificate”), or any other form approved by the Administrative Agent, to the effect that such Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled foreign corporation” described -36-        in Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, and that no payments in connection with the Loan Documents are effectively connected with such Lender’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business and (y) two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or any successor forms), (D)    to the extent a Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example, where the Lender is a partnership, or is a Lender that has granted a participation), Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms) of the Lender, accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, United States Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9, Form W-8IMY (or other successor forms) or any other required information from each beneficial owner, as applicable (provided that, if the Lender is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and one or more direct or indirect partners are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, the United States Tax Compliance Certificate shall be provided by such Lender on behalf of such direct or indirect partner(s)), or(E)    any other form prescribed by applicable requirements of U.S. federal income tax law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable requirements of law to permit the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.(iii)If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their FATCA obligations, to determine whether such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender’s FATCA obligations and to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment.Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause (e), a Lender shall not be required to deliver any forms, documentation or other information that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver.(f)    If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.19, it shall pay over such refund to the applicable Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the such Loan Party under this Section 2.19 with respect to the Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund, net of any Taxes payable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender); provided that the applicable Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.(g)    The agreements in this Section 2.19 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, any assignment by or replacement of a Lender, resignation of the Administrative Agent and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder or any other Loan Document.    -37-        (h)    For the avoidance of doubt, any payments made by the Administrative Agent to any Lender shall be treated as payments made by the applicable Loan Party.2.20.    Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment or conversion of Eurodollar Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto.  Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market.  A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.20, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.20 for any amounts incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such 180 days period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect.  This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Term Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.2.21.    Change of Lending Office.  Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.18 or 2.19(a) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Term Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided that such designation is made on terms that, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage; and provided further that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.18 or 2.19(a).2.22.    Fees.(a)    The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the administrative agency fees in the amounts and on the dates as set forth in the Fee Letter and to perform any other obligations contained therein.(b)    The Borrower agrees to pay on the Closing Date to the Administrative Agent for the pro rata benefit of each Lender making Term Loans on the Closing Date an upfront fee in an amount equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans borrowed on the Closing Date; provided that such upfront fees may be structured as original issue discount as agreed between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.2.23.    RESERVED.  2.24.    Nature of Fees.  All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (for the respective accounts of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders), as provided herein.

provided that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement pursuant to preceding clause (a), such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.21 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Sections 2.18, 2.19 or 2.20, (iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Term Loans outstanding and other amounts related thereto owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.20 if any Eurodollar Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution (if other than a then existing Lender or an affiliate thereof) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.6 (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein), (viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 2.18, 2.19 or 2.20, as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.2.27.    Extensions of Loans and Commitments.(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, pursuant to one or more offers (each, an “Extension Offer”) made from time to time by the Borrower to any or all Lenders holding Term Loans with a like Stated Maturity, the Borrower may from time to time extend the maturity date of any Term Loans and otherwise modify the terms of such Term Loans pursuant to the terms of the relevant Extension Offer (including, without limitation, by increasing the interest rate or fees payable in respect of such Term Loans (and related outstandings), in each case, without the consent of any other Lenders) (an “Extension”, and each group of Term Loans so extended, as well as the original Term Loans (not so extended), being a “tranche”; any Extended Term Loans shall constitute a separate tranche of Term Loans from the tranche of Term Loans from which they were converted), so long as the following terms are satisfied:  (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time any the offering document in respect of an Extension Offer is delivered to the Lenders, (ii) except as to interest rates, fees and final maturity, the Term Loans of any Lender (an “Extending Term Lender”) extended pursuant to an Extension (an “Extended Term Loan”) shall be a Term Loan with the same terms as the original Term Loans; provided that at no time shall there be Term Loans hereunder (including Extended Term Loans and any original Term Loans) which have more than three different Stated Maturities, (iii) if the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans in respect of which Lenders shall have accepted the relevant Extension Offer shall exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of Term Loans offered to be extended by the Borrower pursuant to such Extension Offer, then the Term Loans of such Lenders shall be extended ratably up to such maximum amount based on the respective principal amounts (but not to exceed actual holdings of record) with respect to which such Lenders have accepted such Extension Offer, (iv) all documentation in respect of such Extension shall be consistent with the foregoing, and all written communications by the Borrower generally directed to the Lenders in connection therewith shall be in form and substance consistent with the foregoing and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and (v) any applicable Minimum Extension Condition shall be satisfied.(b)    With respect to all Extensions consummated by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.27, (i) such Extensions shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments for purposes of Section 2.13 or 2.14 and (ii) no Extension Offer is required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum increment, provided that the Borrower may at its election specify as a condition (a “Minimum Extension Condition”) to consummating any such Extension that a minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the relevant Extension Offer in the Borrower’s discretion) of Term Loans of any or all applicable tranches be tendered.  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby consent to the Extensions and the other transactions contemplated by this Section 2.27(b) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment of any interest or fees in respect of any Extended Term Loans on such terms as may be set forth in the relevant -39-        Extension Offer) and hereby waive the requirements of any provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.17 and 9.7(a)) or any other Loan Document that may otherwise prohibit any such Extension or any other transaction contemplated by this Section 2.27.(c)    The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Borrower as may be necessary in order establish new tranches or sub-tranches in respect of Term Loans so extended and such technical amendments as may be necessary in connection with the establishment of such new tranches or sub-tranches, in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.27.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation) to seek the advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders with respect to any matter contemplated by this Section 2.27(c) and, if the Administrative Agent seeks such advice or concurrence, the Administrative Agent shall be permitted to enter into such amendments with the Borrower in accordance with any instructions actually received by such Required Lenders and shall also be entitled to refrain from entering into such amendments with the Borrower unless and until it shall have received such advice or concurrence; provided, however, that whether or not there has been a request by the Administrative Agent for any such advice or concurrence, all such amendments entered into with the Borrower by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be binding and conclusive on the Lenders.  Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with any Extensions, the respective Loan Parties shall (at their expense) amend (and the Collateral Agent is hereby directed to amend) any Mortgage that has a maturity date prior to the then latest Stated Maturity so that such maturity date is extended to the then latest Stated Maturity (or such later date as may be advised by local counsel to the Collateral Agent).(d)    In connection with any Extension, the Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent at least five (5) Business Days’ (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior written notice thereof, and shall agree to such procedures, if any, as may be established by, or acceptable to, the Administrative Agent, in each case acting reasonably to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.27. 2.28.    Buy Backs.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Borrower may conduct reverse Dutch auctions from time to time in order to purchase Term Loans of any particular tranche(s), as determined by the Borrower in its sole discretion (each, an “Auction”) (each such Auction to be managed exclusively by MSSF (if so agreed by MSSF) or another investment bank or commercial bank of recognized standing selected by the Borrower (in such capacity, the “Auction Manager”)), so long as the following conditions are satisfied: (i) each Auction shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures, terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2.28 and Exhibit I, (ii) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of the delivery of each Auction Notice in connection with any Auction, (iii) the minimum principal amount (calculated on the face amount thereof) of each and all tranches of Term Loans that the Borrower offers to purchase in any such Auction shall be no less than $50,000,000 (across all such tranches (or such lesser amount as may be acceptable to the Auction Manager)) or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iv) the aggregate principal amount (calculated on the face amount thereof) of all Term Loans of the applicable tranche or tranches so purchased by the Borrower shall automatically be cancelled and retired by the Borrower on the settlement date of the relevant purchase (and may not be resold) and (v) at the time of each purchase of Term Loans through an Auction, the Borrower shall have delivered to the Auction Manager an officer’s certificate of a Responsible Officer certifying as to compliance with preceding clause (iv).  The Borrower must terminate an Auction if it fails to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth above which are required to be met at the time which otherwise would have been the time of purchase of Term Loans pursuant to the respective Auction.  If the Borrower commences any Auction (and all relevant requirements set forth above which are required to be satisfied at the time of the commencement of the respective Auction have in fact been satisfied), and if at such time of commencement the Borrower reasonably believes that all required conditions set forth above which are required to be satisfied at the time of the purchase of Term Loans pursuant to such Auction shall be satisfied, then the Borrower shall have no liability to any Lender for any termination of the respective Auction as a result of its failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth above which are required to be met at the time which otherwise would have been the time of purchase of Term Loans pursuant to the respective Auction, and any such failure shall not result in any Default or Event of Default hereunder.  With respect to all purchases of Term Loans of the applicable tranche or tranches made by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.28, (x) the Borrower shall pay on the settlement date of each such purchase all accrued and unpaid interest (except to the extent otherwise set forth in the relevant Offer Documents), if any, on the purchased Term Loans of the applicable tranche or tranches up to the settlement date of such purchase and (y) such purchases (and the payments made by the -40-        Borrower and the cancellation of the purchased Loans, in each case in connection therewith) shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments for purposes of Section 2.13 or 2.14.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that in connection with each Auction, (i) the Borrower may purchase or acquire Term Loans hereunder from Lenders from time to time, subject to this Section 2.28, (ii) the Borrower then may have, and later may come into possession of, information regarding the Term Loans or the Loan Parties hereunder that is not known to such Lender and that may be material to a decision by such Lender to enter into an assignment of such Term Loans hereunder (“Excluded Information”), (iii) such Lender has independently and without reliance on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries made such Lender’s own analysis and determined to enter into an assignment of such Term Loans and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby notwithstanding such Lender’s lack of knowledge of the Excluded Information and (iv) the Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall have no liability to such Lender, and such Lender hereby waives and releases, to the extent permitted by law, any claims such Lender may have against the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, under applicable laws or otherwise, with respect to the nondisclosure of the Excluded Information.  Each Lender further acknowledges that the Excluded Information may not be available to the Administrative Agent, the Auction Manager or the other Lenders hereunder.  Each Lender which tenders (or does not tender) Term Loans pursuant to an Auction agrees to the provisions of the two preceding sentences, and agrees that they shall control, notwithstanding any inconsistent provision hereof or in any Assignment and Acceptance.  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby consent to the Auctions and the other transactions contemplated by this Section 2.28 and hereby waive the requirements of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that may otherwise prohibit any Auction or any other transaction contemplated by this Section 2.28.  The Auction Manager acting in its capacity as such hereunder shall be entitled to the benefits of the provisions of Section 8 and Section 9.5 mutatis mutandis as if each reference therein to the “Administrative Agent” or an “Agent” were a reference to the Auction Manager, and the Administrative Agent shall cooperate with the Auction Manager as reasonably requested by the Auction Manager in order to enable it to perform its responsibilities and duties in connection with each Auction.SECTION 3Representations and WarrantiesIn order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make Term Loans, the Borrower represents and warrants on the Closing Date to the Administrative Agent and to each Lender as follows:3.1.    Existence; Compliance with Law.

or(B)    results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity,and the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $100,000,000 or more;

or-56-        (iii)    orders the liquidation of the Borrower or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Guarantors that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary;and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days.In the case of an Event of Default specified in clause (i) or (j) of this Section 7.1 with respect to the Borrower, all outstanding Term Loans will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice.  If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Required Lenders may declare all the Term Loans to be due and payable immediately.  Upon any such declaration, the Term Loans shall become due and payable immediately.  The Required Lenders by written notice to the Administrative Agent may, on behalf of all of the Lenders, rescind an acceleration and its consequences, if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium that has become due solely because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived.SECTION 8The Agents8.1.    Appointment.  Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Administrative Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Collateral Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, none of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent.8.2.    Delegation of Duties.  Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may execute any of their duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys in fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.  None of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys in fact selected by it with reasonable care.8.3.    Exculpatory Provisions.  Neither any Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys in fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Person’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party a party thereto to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.  The Agents shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party.-57-        8.4.    Reliance by the Agents.  The Agents shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, email message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts reasonably selected by the Agents.  The Agents may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent.  The Agents shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless such Agent shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  The Agents shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, all Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.8.5.    Notice of Default.  The Agents shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless such Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default”.  In the event that any Agent receives such a notice, it shall give notice thereof to the Lenders.  The Agents shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, all Lenders); provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as the Administrative Agent shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.8.6.    Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders.  Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys in fact or affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender.  Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates and made its own decision to make its Term Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates.  Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys in fact or affiliates.8.7.    Indemnification.  The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agents in their capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Term Percentage in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section 8.7 (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Term Commitments shall have terminated and the Term Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Term Percentage immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Term Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent, in any way relating to or arising out of, the Term Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any -58-        portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The agreements in this Section 8.7 shall survive the payment of the Term Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.8.8.    Agent in Its Individual Capacity.  Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an Agent.  With respect to its Term Loans made or renewed by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms “Lender” and “Lenders” shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.8.9.    Successor Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon ten (10) days’ notice to the Lenders and the Borrower.  If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall be subject to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term “Administrative Agent” shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent’s rights, powers and duties as an Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Term Loans.  If no successor agent has accepted appointment as an Administrative Agent by the date that is ten (10) days following the retiring Administrative Agent’s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.  After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation, the provisions of this Section 8 and Section 9.5 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.8.10.    RESERVED.8.11.    Collateral Security.  The Collateral Agent will hold, administer and manage any Collateral pledged from time to time under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement either in its own name or as Collateral Agent, but each Lender shall hold a direct, undivided pro rata beneficial interest therein, on the basis of its proportionate interest in the secured obligations, by reason of and as evidenced by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, subject to the priority of payments referenced in Section 6.5 of the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement and subject to the terms of the Collateral Agency and Intercreditor Agreement.8.12.    Enforcement by the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent.  All rights of action under this Agreement and under the Notes and all rights to the Collateral hereunder may be enforced by the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent and any suit or proceeding instituted by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in furtherance of such enforcement shall be brought in its name as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent without the necessity of joining as plaintiffs or defendants any other Lenders, and the recovery of any judgment shall be for the benefit of Lenders subject to the expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent.8.13.    Withholding Tax.  To the extent required by any applicable law (as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent may deduct or withhold from any payment to any Lender under any Loan Document an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  If the Internal Revenue Service or any other authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Agents (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Loan Parties pursuant to Sections 2.18 and 2.19 and without limiting or expanding the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses and any out-of-pocket expenses, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to -59-        the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 8.13.  The agreements in this Section 8.13 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of this Agreement and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.  SECTION 9Miscellaneous9.1.    Amendments and Waivers.(a)    None of this Agreement, any Note, any other Loan Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.1.  Except to the extent otherwise provided in (or permitted by) the Collateral Agency and Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, the Required Lenders and each Loan Party party to the relevant Loan Document may, or, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and each Loan Party party to the relevant Loan Document may, from time to time, (I) enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto or to the other Loan Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or of the Loan Parties hereunder or thereunder or (II) waive, on such terms and conditions as the Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification shall (A)(i) forgive the principal amount or extend the final scheduled date of maturity of any Term Loan, (ii) reduce the stated rate of any interest or fee payable hereunder (except in connection with the waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates (which waiver shall be effective with the consent of the Required Lenders)) or extend the scheduled date of any payment thereof, (iii) increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any Lender’s Term Commitment (it being understood that a waiver of any Event of Default or Default shall not be deemed to be an increase in the amount of any Lender’s Term Commitments), or (iv) release all or substantially all of the Collateral for the Obligations or release all or substantially all of the Guarantors (except, in either case, as expressly permitted by the Loan Documents), in each case without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (B) RESERVED; (C) without the consent of all the Lenders, (i) amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section 9.1(a) or any other provision of any Section hereof expressly requiring the consent of all the Lenders (except, in either case, for technical amendments with respect to additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement which afford protections to such additional extensions of credit of the type provided to the Term Commitments on the Closing Date), or (ii) reduce the percentage specified in or otherwise change the definition of Required Lenders (it being understood that, with the consent of the Required Lenders or as otherwise permitted hereunder, additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the determination of the Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the extensions of Term Commitments are included on the Closing Date), or (iii) change Section 2.17 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby (other than as permitted thereby or by Section 9.1(b)), (D) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 8 or any other provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, which affects, the rights, duties or obligations of the Administrative Agent without the written consent of the Administrative Agent and (E) require consent of any Person to an amendment to this Agreement made pursuant to Section 2.27 other than the Borrower and each Lender participating in the respective Extension.  Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding upon the Loan Parties, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all future holders of the Loans.  In the case of any waiver, the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under any other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to have not occurred or to be cured and not continuing, as the parties may agree; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.-60-        (b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Borrower and the institutions providing each Refinancing Credit Facility (as defined below) (a) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this Agreement for the purpose of refinancing or replacing any and all of the Term Loans and Term Commitments hereunder (each a “Refinancing Credit Facility”) and to permit the extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (b) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders; provided that (i) no Default or Event of Default then exists or would result therefrom, (ii) any Refinancing Credit Facility does not mature prior to the earliest maturity date of the Term Loans being refinanced and (iii) the other terms and conditions of such Refinancing Credit Facility (excluding pricing and optional prepayment and redemption terms) are substantially identical to, or (taken as a whole) are no more favorable to the Lenders providing such Refinancing Credit Facility than, those applicable to the Term Loans being refinanced (except for covenants or other provisions applicable only to periods after the latest Termination Date of the Term Loans existing at the time of such refinancing).(c)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.1, if the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall have jointly identified an obvious error or any error or omission of a technical or immaterial nature, in each case, in any provision of the Loan Documents, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend such provision and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Loan Document if the same is not objected to in writing by the Required Lenders within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of notice thereof.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are each hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender (and each such Lender expressly consents), without any further action or the consent of any other party to any Loan Document, to make any technical amendments to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement to correct any cross-references therein to any provision of this Agreement that may be necessary in order to properly reflect the amendments made to this Agreement.9.2.    Notices.(a)    All notices, requests and demands to or upon the respective parties hereto to be effective shall be in writing (including by telecopy), and, unless otherwise expressly provided herein, shall be deemed to have been duly given or made when received, addressed as follows in the case of the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent, and as set forth in the administrative questionnaire delivered to the Administrative Agent in the case of the Lenders, or to such other address as may be hereafter notified by the respective parties hereto and any future holders of the Notes:The Borrower and the Guarantors:Calpine Corporation 717 Texas Avenue Suite 1000 Houston, TX 77002 Attention: Chief Legal Officer Telecopier No.: 832-325-4508   with copies (which shall not constitute notice) to:   717 Texas Avenue Suite 1000 Houston, TX 77002 Attention: Associate General Counsel Telecopier No.: 713-830-8751  -61-        The Administrative Agent:Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. 1585 Broadway New York, NY 10036 Attn: Agency Team Telecopier No.: (212) 507-6680   with copies (which shall not constitute notice) to:   Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP 80 Pine Street New York, NY 10005 Attention:  William J.

None of the Agents or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors or representatives warrant the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the Approved Electronic Communications or the Platform and each expressly disclaims liability for errors or omissions in the Platform and the Approved Electronic Communications.  No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects is made by any of the Agents or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors or representatives in connection with the Platform or the Approved Electronic Communications.(f)    Each of the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agents agree that Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, store any Approved Electronic Communications on the Platform in accordance with the Administrative Agent’s customary document retention procedures and policies.9.3.    No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.  The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.9.4.    Survival of Representations and Warranties.

The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred in connection with (i) the development, negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Notes and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, including any amendment, supplement or modification to any of the foregoing and (ii) the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Arrangers, taken as a whole (and, to the extent necessary, one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for all such entities, taken as a whole and, solely in the case of an actual or potential conflict of interest, one additional local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction to the affected entities similarly situated, taken as a whole), and security interest filing and recording fees and expenses, (b) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each Lender for all its reasonable costs and expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under this Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, including without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders and each of their respective affiliates, taken as a whole (and, to the extent reasonably necessary, one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for all such entities, taken as a whole, and, solely in the case of an actual or potential conflict of interest, one additional local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction to the affected entities similarly situated, taken as a whole), (c) to pay, and indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, each Arranger, the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent from, any and all recording and filing fees and any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying, stamp, excise and other taxes, if any, which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of, or consummation or administration of any of the transactions contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, this Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents (without duplication to payments made pursuant to Section 2.19) and (d) to pay, and indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, each -63-        Arranger, the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent and each of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives, partners and agents (each, an “Indemnitee”) from and against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance, preservation of rights and administration of this Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or the use of the proceeds of the Term Loans or any of the foregoing relating to the violation of, noncompliance with or liability under, any Environmental Law applicable to the operations of the Loan Parties or any of their respective properties and the reasonable fees and expenses of one legal counsel for the Indemnitees taken as a whole in connection with claims, actions or proceedings by any Indemnitee against any Loan Party under any Loan Document (all the foregoing in this clause (d), collectively, the “indemnified liabilities”), provided that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee with respect to indemnified liabilities to the extent (x) determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of  such Indemnitee or any of such Indemnitee’s Related Persons, (y) resulting from a material breach by such Indemnitee or any of such Indemnitee’s Related Persons of its material obligations under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or (z) related to any dispute solely among Indemnitees other than any claims against any Indemnitee in its capacity or in fulfilling its role as an Agent, an Arranger or any similar role under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and other than any claims involving any act or omission on the part of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries; provided, further, that the Borrower shall in no event be responsible for consequential, indirect, special or punitive damages to any Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 9.5 except such consequential, indirect, special or punitive damages required to be paid by such Indemnitee in respect of any indemnified liabilities.  Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower agrees not to assert and to cause its Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby waives and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to waive, all rights for contribution or any other rights of recovery with respect to all claims, demands, penalties, fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses of whatever kind or nature, under or related to Environmental Laws, that any of them might have by statute or otherwise against any Indemnitee.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Loan Party nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall assert, and each Loan Party hereby waives, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, any claim against each Lender, each Arranger, each Agent and their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, representatives, agents or sub-agents, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) (whether or not the claim therefor is based on contract, tort or duty imposed by any applicable legal requirement) arising out of, in connection with, as a result of, or in any way related to, this Agreement or any Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby or referred to herein or therein, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Term Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof or any act or omission or event occurring in connection therewith, and each Loan Party hereby waives, releases and agrees, on behalf of themselves and each of their respective Subsidiaries, not to sue upon any such claim or any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.  All amounts due under this Section 9.5 shall be payable not later than 10 days after written demand therefor.  Statements payable by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 9.5 shall be submitted to the Treasurer of the Borrower (Telecopy No. 713-353-9144), at the address of the Borrower set forth in Section 9.2 (with copies (which shall not constitute notice) to the Associate General Counsel of the Borrower at the respective addresses set forth in Section 9.2), or to such other Person or address as may be hereafter designated by the Borrower in a written notice to the Administrative Agent.  The agreements in this Section shall survive repayment of the Term Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.9.6.    Successors and Assigns; Participations.(a)    The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted, except that (i) unless otherwise permitted by Section 6.3 hereof, the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section.(b)    (i)  Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (each, an “Assignee”) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Term Commitments and the Term Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent of:-64-        (A)    the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund (as defined below) or, if an Event of Default under Section 7.1(a), 7.1(b), 7.1(i) (in the case of the Borrower only) or 7.1(j) (in the case of the Borrower only) has occurred and is continuing, any other Person; and(B)    the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund. (ii)    Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:(A)    except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Term Loans, the amount of the Term Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that (1) no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under Section 7(a), 7.1(b), 7.1(i) (in the case of Borrower only) or 7.1(j) (in the case of the Borrower only) has occurred and is continuing and (2) such amounts shall be aggregated in respect of each Lender and its affiliates or Approved Funds, if any;(B)    (1) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (although the Borrower shall not be responsible for the payment of the recordation fee unless the Borrower has chosen to replace a Lender pursuant to Section 2.26) and (2) the assigning Lender shall have paid in full any amounts owing by it to the Administrative Agent;(C)    the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire in which the Assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Borrower and its Affiliates and their related parties or their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignee’s compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws; and(D)    except as provided in Section 2.28, none of the Loan Parties, their respective Affiliates or any natural person shall be an Assignee hereunder.For the purposes of this Section 9.6, “Approved Fund” means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.(iii)    Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) below, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.18, 2.19, 2.20 and 9.5 for the period of time in which it was a Lender hereunder.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.-65-        (iv)    The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Term Commitments of, and principal amount (and interest amounts) of the Term Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive (absent manifest error), and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  Any assignment of any Term Loan shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register.(v)    Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance (executed via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent (or, if previously agreed with the Administrative Agent, manually)), by a transferor Lender and an Assignee, as the case may be (and, in the case of an Assignee that is not then a Lender, by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to the extent required under paragraph (c) above), together with payment to the Administrative Agent by the transferor Lender or the Assignee of a recordation and processing fee of $3,500 (which fee may be waived or reduced in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) on the effective date of such transfer determined pursuant thereto record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give notice of such acceptance and recordation to the transferor Lender, the Assignee and the Borrower.(vi)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 9.6(b), no consent of the Administrative Agent (and no processing and recordation fee or administrative questionnaire) shall be required to be obtained, paid or delivered (as the case may be) for any assignment of Term Loans in any principal amount as part of a purchase of such Term Loans in accordance with Section 2.28. (c)    Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than a Loan Party or any of their respective controlled Affiliates) (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Term Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and any other Loan Document or to otherwise exercise its voting righting rights under this Agreement and any other Loan Document; provided that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of Section 9.1(a) and (2) directly affects such Participant.  Subject to paragraph (c)(i) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.18, 2.19 and 2.20 (subject to the requirements and limitations of such sections and Sections 2.21 and 2.26 and it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.19(e) shall be delivered solely to the participating Lender) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.7(b) as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant shall be subject to Section 9.7(a) as though it were a Lender.(i)    A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.18, 2.19 or 2.20 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent that any entitlement to a greater payment results from a change in any Requirement of Law arising after such Participant became a Participant.-66-        (ii)    Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and related interest amounts) of each participant’s interest in the Term Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”).  The entries in a Participant Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  No Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of a Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Loans) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loan is in registered form under Section 5f.103(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations or, if different, under Sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code.(d)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.(e)    Subject to Section 9.15, the Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Transferee and any prospective Transferee (in each case which agrees to comply with the provisions of Section 9.15 or confidentiality requirements no less restrictive on such prospective transferee than those set forth in Section 9.15) any and all financial information in such Lender’s possession concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower in connection with such Lender’s credit evaluation of the Borrower and its Affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Agreement.9.7.    Adjustments; Setoff.(a)    Except to the extent that this Agreement, any other Loan Document or a court order expressly provides or permits for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender or to the Lenders, if any Lender (a “Benefited Lender”) shall receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it (other than in connection with an assignment or participation made pursuant to Section 9.6 or in connection with an Auction that is permitted under Section 2.28), or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by setoff, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 7.1(i) or (j), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of the Obligations owing to such other Lender, such Benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of the Obligations owing to each such other Lender, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders; provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.7(a), no purchase of Term Loans in connection with an Auction that is permitted under Section 2.28 (and no payment made or cancellation of such Term Loans in connection therewith) and no extension of Term Loans that is permitted under Section 2.27 shall constitute a payment of any of such Term Loans for purposes of this Section 9.7.  (b)    In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law and subject to the terms of the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, each Lender shall have the right, without notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any Obligations becoming due and payable by the Borrower (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to apply to the payment of such Obligations, by setoff or otherwise, any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender, any affiliate thereof or any of their respective branches or agencies to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower.  Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and -67-        the Administrative Agent after any such application made by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such application.9.8.    Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.  Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or email transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.9.9.    Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.9.10.    Integration.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the entire agreement of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Administrative Agent or any Lender relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents.9.11.    GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.9.12.    Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers.

Each Agent, each Arranger and each Lender agrees to keep confidential all non-public information provided to it by any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement; provided that nothing herein shall prevent any Agent, any Arranger or any Lender from disclosing any such information (a) to the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or any affiliate thereof (so long as such affiliate agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 9.15), (b) subject to an agreement to comply with provisions no less restrictive than this Section 9.15, to any actual or prospective Transferee or any direct or indirect counterparty to any Swap Agreement (or any professional advisor to such counterparty), (c) to its employees, directors, officers, agents, attorneys, accountants, partners and other professional advisors or those of any of its affiliates, (d) upon the request or demand, or in accordance with the requirements (including reporting requirements), of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such Lender, provided that to the extent permitted by law, such Lender shall promptly notify the applicable Loan Party of such disclosure (except with respect to any audit or examination conducted by bank accountants or any governmental bank authority exercising examination or regulatory authority), (e) in response to any order of any court or other Governmental Authority or as may otherwise be required pursuant to any Requirement of Law or other legal process, provided that to the extent permitted by law, such Lender shall promptly notify the applicable Loan Party of such disclosure (except with respect to any audit or examination conducted by bank accountants or any governmental bank authority exercising examination or regulatory authority), (f) if requested or required to do so in connection with any litigation or similar proceeding; provided that to the extent permitted by law, such Lender shall promptly notify the applicable Loan Party of such disclosure, (g) to the extent such information has been independently developed by such Lender or that has been publicly disclosed other than in breach of this Agreement, (h) to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about a Lender’s investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued with respect to such Lender, or (i) in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document.Each Lender acknowledges that all information, including requests for waivers and amendments, furnished by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to, or in the course of administering this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, will be syndicate-level information, which may (except as provided in the following paragraph) contain material non-public information concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates and their related parties or their respective securities.  Accordingly, each Lender confirms to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that (i) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information, (ii) it has identified in its administrative questionnaire a credit contact who may receive information that may contain material non-public information in accordance with its compliance procedures and applicable law, including Federal and state securities laws and (iii) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with those procedures and applicable law, including Federal and state securities laws.The Borrower acknowledges that certain of the Lenders may be “public-side” Lenders (Lenders that do not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to the Borrower, its subsidiaries or their securities) (each, a “Public Lender”) and, if documents required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.1 or 5.2 or otherwise are being distributed through the Platform, the Borrower agrees to designate those documents or other information that are suitable for delivery to the Public Lenders as such.

It is not intended to be a definitive statement of all of the terms and conditions of a reverse Dutch auction, the definitive terms and conditions for which shall be set forth in the applicable offer document (each, an “Offer Document”).  None of the Administrative Agent, the Auction Manager and any other Agent, or any of their respective affiliates makes any recommendation pursuant to any Offer Document as to whether or not any Lender should sell its Term Loans to the Borrower pursuant to any Offer Documents, nor shall the decision by the Administrative Agent, the Auction Manager or any other Agent (or any of their affiliates) in its respective capacity as a Lender to sell its Term Loans to the Borrower be deemed to constitute such a recommendation.  Each Lender should make its own decision on whether to sell any of its Term Loans and, if it decides to do so, the principal amount of and price to be sought for such Term Loans.  In addition, each Lender should consult its own attorney, business advisor or tax advisor as to legal, business, tax and related matters concerning each Auction and the relevant Offer Documents.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Exhibit I have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.Summary.  The Borrower may from time to time conduct reverse Dutch auctions in order to purchase Term Loans (each, an “Auction”) pursuant to the procedures described herein.  Notice Procedures.  In connection with each Auction, the Borrower will provide notification to the Auction Manager (for distribution to the Lenders of the applicable tranche(s)) of the tranche or tranches of Term Loans (as determined by the Borrower in its sole discretion) that will be the subject of such Auction (each, an “Auction Notice”).  Each Auction Notice shall contain (i) the maximum principal amount (calculated on the face amount thereof) of each tranche of Term Loans that the Borrower offers to purchase in such Auction (the “Auction Amount”), which shall be no less than $50,000,000 (across all such tranches (or such lesser amount as may be acceptable to the Auction Manager)) or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; (ii) the range of discounts to par (the “Discount Range”), expressed as a range of prices per $1,000 (in increments of $5), at which the Borrower would be willing to purchase Term Loans of  each applicable tranche in such Auction; and (iii) the date on which such Auction will conclude, on which date Return Bids (as defined below) will be due by 1:00 p.m. New York time (as such date and time may be extended by the Auction Manager and the Borrower, such time the “Expiration Time”).  Such Expiration Time may be extended for a period not exceeding three Business Days upon notice by the Borrower to the Auction Manager received not less than 24 hours before the original Expiration Time; provided, however, that only one extension per offer shall be permitted. An Auction shall be regarded as a “Failed Auction” in the event that either (x) the Borrower withdraws such Auction in accordance with the terms hereof or (y) the Expiration Time occurs with no Qualifying Bids (as defined below) having been received.  In the event of a Failed Auction, the Borrower shall not be permitted to deliver a new Auction Notice prior to the I-1date occurring three (3) Business Days after such withdrawal or Expiration Time, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Borrower shall not initiate any Auction by delivering an Auction Notice to the Auction Manager until after the conclusion (whether successful or failed) of the previous Auction (if any), whether such conclusion occurs by withdrawal of such previous Auction or the occurrence of the Expiration Time of such previous Auction.Reply Procedures.  In connection with any Auction, each Lender of the applicable tranche(s) wishing to participate in such Auction shall, prior to the Expiration Time, provide the Auction Manager with a notice of participation, in the form included in the respective Offer Document (each, a “Return Bid”) which shall specify (i) a discount to par that must be expressed as a price per $1,000 (in increments of $5) in principal amount of Term Loans (the “Reply Price”) of the applicable tranche within the Discount Range and (ii) the principal amount of Term Loans of the applicable tranche, in an amount not less than US$1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, that such Lender offers for sale at its Reply Price (the “Reply Amount”).  A Term Lender may submit a Reply Amount that is less than the minimum amount and incremental amount requirements described above only if the Reply Amount comprises the entire amount of the Term Loans of the applicable tranche held by such Lender.  Lenders may only submit one Return Bid per tranche per Auction but each Return Bid may contain up to three component bids, each of which may result in a separate Qualifying Bid and each of which will not be contingent on any other component bid submitted by such Lender resulting in a Qualifying Bid.  In addition to the Return Bid, the participating Lender must execute and deliver, to be held by the Auction Manager, an assignment and acceptance in the form included in the Offer Document (each, an “Auction Assignment and Acceptance”).  The Borrower will not purchase any Term Loans at a price that is outside of the applicable Discount Range, nor will any Return Bids (including any component bids specified therein) submitted at a price that is outside such applicable Discount Range be considered in any calculation of the Applicable Threshold Price.  Acceptance Procedures.  Based on the Reply Prices and Reply Amounts received by the Auction Manager, the Auction Manager, in consultation with the Borrower, will calculate the lowest purchase price (the “Applicable Threshold Price”) for such Auction within the Discount Range for such Auction that will allow the Borrower to complete the Auction by purchasing the full Auction Amount (or such lesser amount of Term Loans for which the Borrower has received Qualifying Bids).  Unless the Auction Notice is withdrawn in accordance with the terms hereof, the Borrower shall purchase Term Loans of the applicable tranche from each Lender whose Return Bid is within the Discount Range and contains a Reply Price that is equal to or less than the Applicable Threshold Price (each, a “Qualifying Bid”). All Term Loans of the applicable tranche included in Qualifying Bids (including multiple component Qualifying Bids contained in a single Return Bid) received at a Reply Price lower than the Applicable Threshold Price will be purchased at such applicable Reply Prices and shall not be subject to proration.  Proration Procedures. All Term Loans offered in Return Bids (or, if applicable, any component thereof) constituting Qualifying Bids at the Applicable Threshold Price will be I-2purchased at the Applicable Threshold Price; provided that if the aggregate principal amount (calculated on the face amount thereof) of all Term Loans of the applicable tranche for which Qualifying Bids have been submitted in any given Auction at the Applicable Threshold Price would exceed the remaining portion of the Auction Amount (after deducting all Term Loans of the applicable tranche to be purchased at prices below the Applicable Threshold Price).  No Return Bids or any component thereof will be accepted above the Applicable Threshold Price.Notification Procedures.  The Auction Manager will calculate the Applicable Threshold Price and post the Applicable Threshold Price and proration factor onto an internet site (including an IntraLinks, SyndTrak or other electronic workspace) in accordance with the Auction Manager’s standard dissemination practices by 4:00 p.m. New York time on the same Business Day as the date the Return Bids were due (as such due date may be extended in accordance with this Exhibit I).  The Auction Manager will insert the principal amount of Term Loans of the applicable tranche to be assigned and the applicable settlement date into each applicable Auction Assignment and Acceptance received in connection with a Qualifying Bid.
