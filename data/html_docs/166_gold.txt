Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Co-Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Designated Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).(e)    Change in Legality Generally.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Rate Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loan, then, upon written notice by such Lender to the Designated Company and the Administrative Agent:(i)    the Commitments of such Lender (if any) to fund the affected Type of Loan shall immediately terminate; and(ii)    (x) such Lender may declare that Eurodollar Rate Loans will not thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness) be continued for additional Interest Periods and Fallback Rate Loans will not thereafter (for such duration) be converted into Eurodollar Rate Loans, whereupon any request to convert a Fallback Rate Borrowing to a Eurodollar Rate Borrowing or to continue a Eurodollar Rate Borrowing for an additional Interest Period shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request to continue a Fallback Rate Loan as such, or to convert a Eurodollar Rate Loan into a Fallback Rate Loan, as the case may be, unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn 112972172.01-CHISR01A - MSWand (y) all such outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender shall be automatically converted to Fallback Rate Loans on the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor or, if earlier, on the date specified by such Lender in such notice (which date shall be no earlier than the last day of any applicable grace period permitted by applicable law).(f)    Increased Tax Costs.  If any Change in Law shall subject any Lender to any (i) Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof, or (ii) Tax imposed on it that is specially (but not necessarily exclusively) applicable to lenders such as such Lender as a result of the general extent and/or nature of their activities, assets, liabilities, leverage, other exposures to risk, or other similar factors, including but not limited to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, regulations, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith, the United Kingdom Tax known as the “bank levy”  in such form as it may be imposed and as amended or reenacted, and similar legislation (except, in each case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), for (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) and (c) of the definition of Excluded Taxes, and (C) Other Connection Taxes that are imposed on or measured by net income, however denominated, or that are franchise Taxes or branch profits Taxes), and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), then, upon request of such Lender, the Co-Borrowers will pay to such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Co-Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.12 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered that are attributable to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by any Party.(g)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Lender shall be entitled to seek compensation for costs incurred under this Section 2.12 unless it is the general policy or practice of such Lender at such time to seek compensation from other borrowers whose transactions with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in circumstances giving rise to such costs and the applicable Lender is generally seeking such compensation from such borrowers (but no Lender shall be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information to confirm the foregoing).Section 2.13    Breakage Payments.  In the event of (a) the payment or prepayment, whether optional or mandatory, of any principal of any Eurodollar Rate Loan earlier than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Rate Loan earlier than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Term Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto, (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan earlier than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Designated Company pursuant to Section 2.16(c), or (e) a Discounted Purchase of any Eurodollar Rate Loan earlier than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, then, in any such event, the Co-Borrowers shall 113972172.01-CHISR01A - MSWcompensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event.  In the case of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Eurodollar Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan) (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any, and the effect of clause (ii) of each of the sentences contained in the “Eurodollar Base Rate” definition), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits of a comparable currency, amount and period from other banks in the applicable interbank market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall be delivered to the Designated Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error.

Each Loan Party shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.12, Section 2.13, Section 2.15, Section 2.16 or Section 11.03, or otherwise) on or before the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 1:00 p.m., London time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All payments by any Loan Party shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent’s Office, except that payments pursuant to Section 2.12, Section 2.13, Section 2.15, Section 2.16, Section 7.10 and Section 11.03 shall be made directly to the persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the persons specified therein.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.  If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, unless specified otherwise, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.

(ii)    Each payment by the Co-Borrowers on account of principal of the Borrowings of any Class shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans then held by the Lenders.  (c)    Insufficient Funds.  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, toward payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, toward payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.(d)    Sharing of Set-Off.  Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, if any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other Obligations resulting in such Lender’s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other Obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:(i)    if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and(ii)    the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by any Loan Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply); provided, that this paragraph shall not apply to purchases pursuant to the Discounted Purchase provisions of Section 11.04(b)(iv).Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Requirements of Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect 115972172.01-CHISR01A - MSWto such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.  If under applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or any similar law any Secured Party receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff or counterclaim to which this Section 2.14(d) applies, such Secured Party shall to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights to which the Secured Party is entitled under this Section 2.14(d) to share in the benefits of the recovery of such secured claim.(e)    Co-Borrower Default.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Designated Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the applicable Co-Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Co-Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if such Co-Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Interbank Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.02(c), Section 2.14(e) or Section 11.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion following 5 Business Days’ prior written notice to such lender (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and, upon full payment of such obligations as provided above, the Administrative Agent shall promptly issue a written notice to such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the application of any amounts on account of such Lender.(g)    Obligations of Lenders Several.  The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 11.03 are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under Section 11.03 on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under Section 11.03.(h)    Funding Source.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.Section 2.15    Taxes.(a)    Payments Free of Taxes.

If any applicable Requirements of Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after all such required deductions and withholdings (including any such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) each Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.  For the avoidance of doubt, each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall be required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA Deduction.  Each Party shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or basis of such FATCA Deduction), and in any case at least three (3) Business Days prior to making a FATCA Deduction, notify the Party to whom it is making the payment and, on or prior to the day on which it notifies that Party, shall also notify the Designated Company, the Agents and the other Lenders.(b)    Payment of Other Taxes by Loan Parties.  Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, each Loan Party shall timely pay to the relevant Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.(c)    Indemnification by Loan Parties.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Designated Company by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by such Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  No Loan Party shall be obliged to provide indemnity under this Section to the extent that the Indemnified Tax in question is compensated for by an increased payment under Sections 2.12(f), 2.15(a) or 7.10.(d)    Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Taxing Authority pursuant to this Agreement, the applicable Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Taxing Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.117972172.01-CHISR01A - MSW(e)    Status of Lenders.

(ii)    If a Party confirms to another Party pursuant to paragraph (i)(A) above that it is a FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not or has ceased to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party reasonably promptly.(iii)    Paragraph (i) above shall not oblige any Lender or any Agent to do anything, and paragraph (i)(C) above shall not oblige any other Party to do anything, which would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of:(A)    any law or regulation;(B)    any fiduciary duty; or(C)    any duty of confidentiality. (iv)    If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with paragraph (i)(A) or (B) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where paragraph (iii) above applies), then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Loan Documents (and payments under them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until such time as the Party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information. (v)    If a Co-Borrower is a US Tax Obligor or the Administrative Agent reasonably believes that its obligations under FATCA or any other applicable law or regulation require it, each Lender shall, within ten Business Days of:(A)    where the Co-Borrower is a US Tax Obligor and the relevant Lender is a Lender on the date of this Agreement, the date of this Agreement;(B)    where a Co-Borrower is a US Tax Obligor on a date on which a Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement and the relevant Lender was not a Lender on the date of this Agreement, the relevant date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement;(C)    the date a new US Tax Obligor accedes as a Co-Borrower; or(D)    where a Co-Borrower is not a US Tax Obligor, the date of a request from the Administrative Agent, supply to the Administrative Agent (to the extent not otherwise supplied pursuant to Section 2.15(e) above):(1)    a withholding certificate on Form W-8, Form W-9 or any other relevant form; or120972172.01-CHISR01A - MSW(2)    any withholding statement or other document, authorization or waiver as the Administrative Agent may require to certify or establish the status of such Lender under FATCA or that other law or regulation.(vi)    The Administrative Agent shall provide any withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorization or waiver it receives from a Lender pursuant to paragraph (v) above to the Designated Company.(vii)    If any withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorization or waiver provided to the Administrative Agent by a Lender pursuant to paragraph (v) above is or becomes materially inaccurate or incomplete, that Lender shall promptly update it and provide such updated withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorization or waiver to the Agent unless it is unlawful for the Lender to do so (in which case the Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent).  The Administrative Agent shall provide any such updated withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorization or waiver to the Designated Company.(viii)    The Administrative Agent may rely on any withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorisation or waiver it receives from a Lender pursuant to paragraph (v) or (vii) above without further verification. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by it under or in connection with paragraph (v), (vi) or (vii) above.(ix)     Without prejudice to any other term of this Agreement, if a Lender fails to supply any withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorization, waiver or information in accordance with paragraph (v) above, or any withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorization, waiver or information provided by a Lender to the Administrative Agent is or becomes materially inaccurate or incomplete, then such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, within three Business Days of demand, against any cost, loss, Tax or liability (including, without limitation, for negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever) incurred by the Administrative Agent (including any related interest and penalties) in acting as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents as a result of such failure.(g)    Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If any Party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified, or as to which it has received additional amounts,  pursuant to this Section 2.15, Section 7.10, or Section 2.12(f) (such Party, the “Indemnified Party”), then it shall pay to the Party that made such indemnity payments or paid such additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.15, Section 7.10, or Section 2.12(f) (such Party, the “Indemnifying Party”) an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made to the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 2.15, or additional amounts paid to the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 7.10 or Section 2.12(f), with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Indemnified Party, and without interest (other than

g) shall be construed to require any Indemnified Party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Indemnifying Party or any other person.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.15(g), in no event will the Indemnified Party be required to pay any amount to an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 2.15(g) the payment of which would place the Indemnified Party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Indemnified Party would have been in if the Taxes subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Taxes had never been paid.(h)    Co-operation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.15(e) or paragraph (k) of the definition of Permitted Reorganization, with  respect to non-U.S. withholding taxes, the relevant Agent, the relevant Lender(s) (at the written request of the relevant Loan Party) and the relevant Loan Party shall, co-operate in completing any procedural formalities necessary (including delivering any documentation prescribed by the applicable Requirement of Law and making any necessary reasonable approaches to the relevant Taxing Authorities) for the relevant Loan Party to obtain authorization to make a payment to which such Agent or such Lender(s) is entitled without any, or a reduced rate of, deduction or withholding for, or on account of, Taxes; provided, however, that none of the Agents or any Lender shall be required to provide any documentation that it is not legally entitled to provide, or take any action that, in the relevant Agent’s or the relevant Lender’s reasonable judgment, would subject such Agent or such Lender to any material unreimbursed costs or otherwise be disadvantageous to it in any material respect.(i)    Indemnification by the Lenders.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within three (3) Business Days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Taxing Authority.  Without limiting the preceding sentence or Section 2.15(f)(ix), each Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (based upon such Lender’s pro rata share of the sum of the total outstanding Term Loans and unused Commitments of all Lenders at the time the applicable indemnity payment is sought (or if the Term Loans have been repaid in full and the Commitments have been terminated, based upon its share of the Term Loans immediately prior to such payment)), within three (3) Business Days of demand, against any cost, loss or liability in relation to any FATCA-related liability incurred by the Administrative Agent in acting as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents (unless the Administrative Agent has been reimbursed by a Loan Party pursuant to a Loan Document); provided that indemnity pursuant to this sentence shall not be available to the extent that such cost, loss or liability are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent. A certificate as to the amount 122972172.01-CHISR01A - MSWof payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 2.15(i).(j)    Tax Returns.  If, as a result of executing a Loan Document, entering into the transactions contemplated thereby or with respect thereto, receiving a payment or enforcing its rights thereunder, any Agent or any Lender is required to file a Tax Return in a jurisdiction in which it would not otherwise be required file, the Loan Parties shall promptly provide such information necessary for the completion and filing of such Tax Return as the relevant Agent or Lender shall reasonably request with respect to the completion and filing of such Tax Return.  For clarification, any expenses incurred in connection with such filing shall be subject to Section 11.03.(k)    Value Added Tax. All amounts set out, or expressed to be payable under a Loan Document by any party to a Lender or Agent which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for value added tax purposes shall be deemed to be exclusive of any applicable value added tax, and accordingly, if value added tax is chargeable on any supply or service made by any Lender or Agent to any party under a Loan Document and such value added tax is required to be collected by such Lender or Agent (or the representative member of any group of which the relevant Lender or Agent forms a part for purposes of value added tax) pursuant to applicable Requirements of Law, that party shall pay to the Lender or Agent (in addition to and at the same time as paying the consideration) an amount equal to the amount of the value added tax (and such Lender or Agent shall promptly provide an appropriate value added invoice to such party).Where a Loan Document requires any party to reimburse a Lender or Agent for any costs or expenses, that party shall also at the same time pay and indemnify the Lender or Agent against all value added tax incurred by the Lender or Agent in respect of the costs or expenses to the extent that the Lender or Agent reasonably determines that neither it nor any other member of any group of which it is a member for value added tax purposes is entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant Taxing Authority in respect of the value added tax.If any Lender or Agent requires any Loan Party to pay any additional amount pursuant to Section 2.15(k), then such Lender or Agent and Loan Party shall use reasonable efforts to co-operate to minimize the amount such Loan Party is required to pay if, in the judgment of such Lender or Agent, such co-operation would not subject such Lender or Agent to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or Agent.  For the avoidance of doubt, all references to value added tax in this Section 2.15(k) include reference to goods and services tax.(l)    Survival.  Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.15 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.123972172.01-CHISR01A - MSWSection 2.16    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.(a)    Designation of a Different Lending Office.  Each Lender may at any time or from time to time designate, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, one or more lending offices (which, for this purpose, may include Affiliates of the respective Lender) for the various Loans made by such Lender; provided that to the extent such designation shall result, as of the time of such designation, in increased costs under Section 2.12, Section 2.15 or Section 7.10 in excess of those which would be charged in the absence of the designation of a different lending office (including a different Affiliate of the respective Lender), then the Loan Parties shall not be obligated to pay such excess increased costs (although the applicable Loan Party, in accordance with and pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement, shall be obligated to pay the costs which would apply in the absence of such designation and any subsequent increased costs of the type described above resulting from changes after the date of the respective designation). Each lending office and Affiliate of any Lender designated as provided above shall, for all purposes of this Agreement, be treated in the same manner as the respective Lender (and shall be entitled to all indemnities and similar provisions in respect of its acting as such hereunder).  Each lending office and Affiliate of any Lender designated as provided above shall, for all purposes of this Agreement, be treated in the same manner as the respective Lender (and shall be entitled to all indemnities and similar provisions in respect of its acting as such hereunder).  The proviso to the first sentence of this Section 2.16(a) shall not apply to changes in a lending office pursuant to Section 2.16(b) if such change was made upon the written request of any Loan Party.  (b)    Mitigation Obligations.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, or requires any Loan Party to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Taxing Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or Section 7.10, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.12, Section 2.15 or Section 7.10, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  Each Loan Party hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.  A certificate setting forth such costs and expenses submitted by such Lender to the Designated Company shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(c)    Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, or if any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Taxing Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or Section 7.10, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if the Designated Company exercises its replacement rights under Section 11.02(d), then the Designated Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice by the Designated Company to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:124972172.01-CHISR01A - MSW(i)    the Co-Borrowers or the assignee shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the processing and recordation fee specified in Section 11.04(b);(ii)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.13), from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Co-Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts, including any amounts under Section 2.10(j));(iii)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15 or Section 7.10, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and(iv)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable Requirements of Law.A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Designated Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.Section 2.17    [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].Section 2.18    [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].Section 2.19    Interest Act (Canada); Criminal Rate of Interest; Nominal Rate of Interest.(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, solely to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines that the calculation or determination of interest or any fee payable by any Canadian Loan Party in respect of the Obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be governed by the laws of any province of Canada or the federal laws of Canada, in no event shall the aggregate interest (as defined in Section 347 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, as the same shall be amended, replaced or re-enacted from time to time, “Section 347”) payable by the Canadian Loan Parties to the Agents or any Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document exceed the effective annual rate of interest on the Credit advances (as defined in Section 347) under this Agreement or such other Loan Document lawfully permitted under Section 347 and, if any payment, collection or demand pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in respect of Interest (as defined in Section 347) is determined to be contrary to the provisions of Section 347, such payment, collection or demand shall be deemed to have been made by mutual mistake of the Agents, the Lenders and the Canadian Loan Parties and the amount of such payment or collection shall be refunded by the relevant Agents and Lenders to the applicable Canadian Loan Parties.  For the purposes of this Agreement and each other Loan Document to which the Canadian Loan Parties are 125972172.01-CHISR01A - MSWa party, the effective annual rate of interest payable by the Canadian Loan Parties shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices and principles over the term of the loans on the basis of annual compounding for the lawfully permitted rate of interest and, in the event of dispute, a certificate of a Fellow of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries appointed by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Canadian Loan Parties will be conclusive for the purpose of such determination in the absence of evidence to the contrary.(b)    For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada) and with respect to Canadian Loan Parties only:(i)    whenever any interest or fee payable by the Canadian Loan Parties is calculated using a rate based on a year of 360 days or 365 days, as the case may be, the rate determined pursuant to such calculation, when expressed as an annual rate, is equivalent to (x) the applicable rate based on a year of 360 days or 365 days, as the case may be, (y) multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in which such rate is to be ascertained and (z) divided by 360 or 365, as the case may be; and(ii)    all calculations of interest payable by the Canadian Loan Parties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document are to be made on the basis of the nominal interest rate described herein and therein and not on the basis of effective yearly rates or on any other basis which gives effect to the principle of deemed reinvestment of interest.The parties hereto acknowledge that there is a material difference between the stated nominal interest rates and the effective yearly rates of interest and that they are capable of making the calculations required to determine such effective yearly rates of interest.Section 2.20    [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].  Section 2.21    [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].Section 2.22    Cashless Rollover of Term Loans.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Lender may exchange, continue or rollover all or a portion of its Loans in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement, or the addition of any Co-Borrowers in connection with the Permitted Reorganization, in each case pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Designated Company, the Administrative Agent and such Lender.Section 2.23    Incremental Term Loan Commitments.(a)    Incremental Request.

No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by this Section 11.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether any Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.  No notice or demand on any Loan Party in any case shall entitle any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.(b)    Required Consents.

The Register shall be available for inspection by the Collateral Agent, the Co-Borrowers and any Lender (with respect to its own interest only), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  The 241972172.01-CHISR01A - MSWrequirements of this Section 11.04(c) are intended to result in any and all Loans being in “registered form” for purposes of Section 871, Section 881 and any other applicable provision of the Code, and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent therewith.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of each Co-Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant's interest in the Commitments and Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans, or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.(d)    Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Co-Borrower or the Administrative Agent sell participations to any person (other than a natural person, a Defaulting Lender or a Co-Borrower, any Co-Borrowers’ or any other Company’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) each Loan Party, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first proviso to Section 11.02(b) that affects such Participant.  Subject to paragraph (e) of this Section, the Co-Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.12, Section 2.13, Section 2.15, Section 2.16 and Section 7.10 (subject to the requirements of those Sections) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided, that such Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.12, Section 2.15, or Section 7.10 with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to such Section 2.14 as though it were a Lender.242972172.01-CHISR01A - MSW(e)    Limitations on Participant Rights.  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.12, Section 2.13, Section 2.15, Section 2.16 and Section 7.10 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Designated Company’s prior written consent.(f)    Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or to any other central bank with jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  (g)    Disqualified Institutions.(i)    No assignment or participation shall be made to any Person that was a Disqualified Institution as of the date (the “Trade Date”) on which the assigning Lender entered into a binding agreement to sell and assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to such Person (unless the Designated Company has consented to such assignment in writing in its sole and absolute discretion, in which case such Person will not be considered a Disqualified Institution for the purpose of such assignment or participation).  For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any assignee that becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable Trade Date (including as a result of the delivery of a notice pursuant to, and/or the expiration of the notice period referred to in, the definition of “Disqualified Institution”), (x) such assignee shall not retroactively be disqualified from becoming a Lender and (y) the execution by the Designated Company of an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignee will not by itself result in such assignee no longer being considered a Disqualified Institution. Any assignment or participation in violation of this clause (g)(i) shall not be void, but the other provisions of this clause (g) shall apply.  (ii)    If any assignment (but not participation) is made to any Disqualified Institution without the Designated Company’s prior written consent in violation of clause (i) above, or any Person (other than a Participant) becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable Trade Date, the Designated Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Institution and the Administrative Agent, (A) purchase or prepay such Term Loan by paying the lesser of (x) the principal amount thereof and (y) the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire such Term Loans, in each case plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder (and, in the case of a purchase, effect an immediate Cancellation) and/or (B) require such Disqualified Institution to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and 243972172.01-CHISR01A - MSWsubject to the restrictions contained in this Section 11.04), all of its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees at the lesser of (x) the principal amount thereof and (y) the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire such interests, rights and obligations, in each case plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder.(iii)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any assignment (but not participation) is made to any Disqualified Institution without the Designated Company’s prior written consent in violation of clause (i) above, then such Disqualified Institution  (A) will not (x) have the right to receive information, reports or other materials provided to Lenders by the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, (y) attend or participate in meetings attended by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, or (z) access any electronic site established for the Lenders or confidential communications from counsel to or financial advisors of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders and (B) (x) for purposes of any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of, or any action under, and for the purpose of any direction to the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, such Disqualified Institution will be deemed to have consented in the same proportion as the Lenders that are not Disqualified Institutions consented to such matter, and (y) for purposes of voting on any plan of reorganization or plan of liquidation pursuant to any Debtor Relief Laws (“Reorganization Plan”), such Disqualified Institution party hereto hereby agrees (1) not to vote on such Reorganization Plan, (2) if such Disqualified Institution does vote on such Reorganization Plan notwithstanding the restriction in the foregoing clause (1), such vote will be deemed not to be in good faith and shall be “designated” pursuant to Section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws), and such vote shall not be counted in determining whether the applicable class has accepted or rejected such Reorganization Plan in accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws) and (3) not to contest any request by any party for a determination by the bankruptcy court (or other applicable court of competent jurisdiction) effectuating the foregoing clause (2).(iv)    The Administrative Agent shall have the right, and the Designated Company hereby expressly authorizes the Administrative Agent, to (A) post the list of Disqualified Institutions provided by the Designated Company and any updates thereto from time to time (collectively, the “DQ List”) on the Platform, including that portion  of the Platform that is designated for “public side” Lenders and/or (B) provide the DQ List to each Lender requesting the same. 244972172.01-CHISR01A - MSWSection 11.05    Survival of Agreement.

(“NDB”) is a Loan Party and the owner of certain hydropower assets in Guaraciaba, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil (the “Hydropower Assets”).  NDB intends to dispose of the Hydropower Assets and, for that purpose, has formed Brecha Energetica Ltda., a special purpose limited liability company in the City of Guaraciaba, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil 259972172.01-CHISR01A - MSW(each, a “Brecha Energetica”), and upon receipt of regulatory approvals from Administrative Council for Economic Defense (“CADE”) and National Agency for Energy (“Aneel”) and conclusion of other measures agreed upon contractually, (i) shall transfer the Hydropower Assets to Brecha Energetica (the “Corporate Reorganization”) and (ii) shall sell the quotas in Brecha Energetica (the “Quota Sale”) to a third-party purchaser  (the “Purchaser”) pursuant to a Quota Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated April 3, 2014 (as amended, restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified, the “Purchase Agreement”).  The Designated Company hereby represents and warrants to the Secured Parties that the Corporate Reorganization and the Quota Sale are permitted under this Agreement.(d)    The Designated Company has determined in its reasonable discretion that the costs associated with causing Brecha Energetica to become a Subsidiary Guarantor and to execute any Security Documents creating and granting a pledge over its property pursuant to Section 5.11(b)(ii) are, in light of the binding commitment to effect the Quota Sale pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, excessive in relation to the benefits that the Secured Parties would obtain.  In reliance upon the foregoing, each Secured Party, by becoming a Party or by receiving the benefit of the terms hereof or of the other Loan Documents, hereby acknowledges that, as of the Closing Date, Brecha Energetica shall not be required to become a Subsidiary Guarantor or execute any Security Documents creating or granting a pledge over its respective property in favor of the Collateral Agent; provided that, if at any time after the Closing Date, the Administrative Agent, in its reasonable discretion, determines that the costs of either such guarantee and pledge are no longer excessive in relation to the benefits afforded thereby, then following written notice from the Administrative Agent, the Designated Company shall have 30 days (or such longer period as agreed to by the Administrative Agent) to satisfy the terms of Section 5.11(b)(ii). The Designated Company shall provide the Administrative Agent with prompt written notice of (i) termination of the Purchase Agreement, (ii) the occurrence of any event which, in the Administrative Agent’s reasonable judgment, would make the Purchaser or NDB, as applicable, unable to satisfy any of the conditions precedent to closing set forth in the Purchase Agreement and (iii) a final and non-appealable refusal of the CADE and Aneel to grant any regulatory consent relating to the Corporate Reorganization or the Quota Sale, in order to assist the Administrative Agent in making the determination described above.Section 11.34    Termination. All agreements, covenants, representations, warranties, rights, duties and obligations of each Party set forth in this Agreement and each other Loan Document shall terminate in all respects at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the Agreement Termination Date if the Closing Date has not occurred on or prior to such time.

In the event that any such non-monetary default by its nature cannot reasonably be cured by Collateral Agent, Landlord shall, provided Collateral Agent has theretofore cured all monetary defaults (if any), upon the request of Collateral Agent enter into a new lease with Collateral Agent (or its nominee) on the same terms and conditions as the Lease.

In furtherance of such intent, the Mortgagor agrees that the Mortgagee may at any time by notice (an “Allocation Notice”) to the Mortgagor allocate a portion (the “Allocated Indebtedness”) of the Secured Obligations to the Mortgaged Property and sever from the remaining Secured Obligations the Allocated Indebtedness.  From and after the giving of an Allocation Notice with respect to the Mortgaged Property, the Secured Obligations hereunder shall be limited to the extent set forth in the Allocation Notice and (as so limited) shall, for all purposes, be construed as a separate loan obligation of the Mortgagor unrelated to the other transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any document related to any thereof.  To the extent that the proceeds on any foreclosure of the Mortgaged Property shall exceed the Allocated Indebtedness, such proceeds shall belong to the Mortgagor and shall not be available hereunder to satisfy any Secured Obligations of the Mortgagor other than the Allocated Indebtedness.  In any action or proceeding to foreclose the Lien hereof or in connection with any power of sale, foreclosure or other remedy exercised under this Mortgage commenced after the giving by the Mortgagee of an Allocation Notice, the Allocation Notice shall be conclusive proof of the limits of the Secured Obligations hereby secured, and the Mortgagor may introduce, by way of defense or counterclaim, evidence thereof in any such action or proceeding.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 11.14, the proceeds received by the Mortgagee pursuant to this Mortgage shall be applied by the Mortgagee in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.03 of the Credit Agreement.(ii)    The Mortgagor hereby waives to the greatest extent permitted under law the right to a discharge of any of the Secured Obligations under any statute or rule of law now or hereafter in effect which provides that foreclosure of the Lien hereof or other remedy exercised under this Mortgage constitutes the exclusive means for satisfaction of the Secured Obligations or which makes unavailable a deficiency judgment or any subsequent remedy because the Mortgagee elected to proceed with a power of sale, foreclosure or such other remedy or because of any failure by the Mortgagee to comply with laws that prescribe conditions to the entitlement to a deficiency judgment.  In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing waiver, any court shall for any reason hold that the Mortgagee is not entitled to a deficiency judgment, the Mortgagor shall not (A) introduce in any other jurisdiction such judgment as a defense to enforcement against the Mortgagor of any remedy in the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document or (B) seek to have such judgment recognized or entered in any other jurisdiction, and any such judgment shall in all events be limited in application only to the state or jurisdiction where rendered.26967770.02F-CHISR01A - MSW(iii)    In the event any instrument in addition to the Allocation Notice is necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 11.14, including, without limitation, any amendment to this Mortgage, any substitute promissory note or affidavit or certificate of any kind, the Mortgagee may execute, deliver or record such instrument as the attorney-in-fact of the Mortgagor.  Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.(iv)    Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, the provisions of this Section 11.14 shall be effective only to the maximum extent permitted by law.ARTICLE XII.INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENTSECTION 12.1.    Intercreditor Agreement.
