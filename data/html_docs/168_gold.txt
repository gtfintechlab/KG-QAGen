Term SOFR Advance, notify the Administrative Agent that the Term SOFR for any Interest Period will not adequately reflect the cost to the Required Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Term SOFR Advances for such Interest
Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the Company and the Lenders, whereupon the Lenders shall have no obligation to make, or convert Advances into, Term SOFR Advances until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and

Administrative Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender to perform its

Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If 
  364-DAY

such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lenders Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. 
(f) Failure to Make Advances. The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve
any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any
Borrowing.  SECTION 2.03 Fees. (a) Commitment Fee. The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the

outstanding on the Termination Date, each such fee to be allocated to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares; and (ii) the conditions listed in Section 3.02(x) and (y) are satisfied on the date of notice of
the Term Loan Election and on the date on which the Term Loan Election is to be effected. All Advances converted into a term loan pursuant to this Section 2.07 shall continue to constitute Advances except that the Borrowers may not reborrow
pursuant to Section 2.01 after all or any portion of such Advances have been prepaid pursuant to Section 2.07(b).(b) Prepayment of Advances. No Borrower shall have the right to prepay any principal amount of any Advances other than

ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in the aggregate principal amount of at least $5,000,000 or a larger whole
multiple of $1,000,000 and, in the case of a payment or prepayment of a Term SOFR Advance other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance as provided herein, shall have the consequences set forth in Section 8.04(b). 
(ii) Change of Control. The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent immediately upon becoming aware of any Change of Control.
Upon receipt of such notice and for a period of 90 days thereafter, the Required Lenders shall be entitled, by written notice to the Company received within such period, to terminate the Commitments in whole and require the Company and any
other Borrower to prepay all outstanding Advances within 5 Business Days of its receipt of such notice, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of such prepayment and any other amounts due hereunder. Notwithstanding any
other provision contained herein, a Change of Control shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Default hereunder.

SECTION 2.08 Increased Costs. (a) Changes in Law, Etc. If, due to
(i) the introduction of or any change in or in the official interpretation of any law or regulation on or after the date of this Agreement, or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request not applicable on the date of this Agreement
from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding, continuing, converting into or maintaining Term SOFR
Advances, then upon demand by such Lender received by the Company (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent) accompanied by the certificate described in the next sentence, pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost, such amounts to be due and payable within two Business Days of such Lenders invoice therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such
increased cost, submitted to the Company and the Administrative Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
(b) Capital Adequacy. If, due to (i) the introduction of or any change in or in the official interpretation of any law or
regulation on or after the date of this Agreement, or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request not applicable on the date of this Agreement from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law,
any Lender determines that the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender has been or would be affected and that the amount of such capital or liquidity is increased
by or based upon the existence of such Lenders Advances or commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments of this type, then, upon demand by such Lender received by the Company within such time from the relevant change or introduction
described above as is reasonably required in order to determine the effect thereof (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent) accompanied by a certificate of such Lender as to the amounts demanded, the Company shall pay, or cause to be
paid, to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation, as the case may be, to the extent that such Lender
reasonably determines such increase in capital or liquidity to be allocable to the existence of such Lenders Advances or commitment to lend hereunder, such amounts to be due and payable within two days of such Lenders invoice
therefor. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Company and the Administrative Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
(c) For the avoidance of doubt, subsections (a) and (b) of this Section above shall include any changes resulting from
(x) requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy issued in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank
for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, and in each case for both clauses

2.16 or 8.04(b)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each
case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Assumption and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(c), from and after the effective
date specified in such Assignment and Assumption, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and
Assumption (which shall not include any Borrower) shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. The making by any Borrower of any payment to the Administrative Agent for
the account of any Lender as herein provided shall pro tanto discharge the relevant obligation of such Borrower to such Lender. 
(b) Setoff. If a Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and its Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other indebtedness
at any time owing by such Lender or its Affiliates to any Borrower against any of and all the obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and the Notes held by such Lender, although such obligations may be unmatured.
The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. 
(c) Interest. All computations of interest based on (i) the Base Rate shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a
year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and (ii) the Term SOFR or the Federal Funds Rate and all computations of interest pursuant to Section 2.06 shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days,
in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate for any Advance
hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  (d) Business Days. Whenever any payment
hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of
interest or commitment fee, as the case may be; provided that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Term SOFR Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding
Business Day.

CREDIT AGREEMENT  28 




(e) Assumption of Payment. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative
Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so
made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.  (f)
Rating Information. The Company will provide to the Administrative Agent promptly upon obtaining knowledge thereof, notice of any change in the rating assigned by S&P, Moodys, or Fitch to the Companys Long-Term Indebtedness
and the date of such change, provided that the Companys failure to provide any of the foregoing information shall be deemed not to be a Default or an Event of Default hereunder. 
(g) Currency of Payments. All amounts payable under this Agreement shall be paid in Dollars. 
SECTION 2.10 Taxes. (a) General. Any and all payments by each Loan Party hereunder or under the Notes shall be made in
accordance with Section 2.09, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto (which are, with respect to payments by the Company
only, and with respect to United States withholding tax, not in effect or not imposed on the date of this Agreement); excluding, in the case of each Lender and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed

imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Lenders Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof, and any U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed under FATCA (all such non-excluded taxes,

delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement not in effect or not imposed on the date of this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as Other Taxes) upon notice from the Lender.

be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from
the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.  (d) Receipt. Within

such event, the relevant Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) substantially in the form of Exhibit E (a
Note) in the case of the Advances. Thereafter, such Advances evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 8.07) be represented by one or more
promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). 
SECTION 2.12 Use of Proceeds of Advances. Each Borrower will use the proceeds of the Advances solely for general corporate
purposes.  SECTION 2.13 Defaulting Lenders. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent shall deliver written notice to such effect upon obtaining knowledge of such event to the Company and such Defaulting Lender, and the following provisions shall apply for so long as
such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:  (i) any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of any Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VI or otherwise) shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the
Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Company may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the
funding of any Advance in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a
result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fourth, so long as no Default or
Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to any Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by such Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders
breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and fifth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment

  364-DAY
CREDIT AGREEMENT  30 





is a payment of the principal amount of any Advance in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Advances were made at a time when the
applicable conditions set forth in Article III were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Advances of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied
to the payment of any Advances of such Defaulting Lender and provided further that any amounts held as cash collateral for funding obligations of a Defaulting Lender shall be returned to such Defaulting Lender upon the termination of
this Agreement and the satisfaction of such Defaulting Lenders obligations hereunder. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to
post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
(b) No Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise affected, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Section 2.13, performance by the Borrowers of their obligations shall not be excused or otherwise modified as a result of the operation of this Section 2.13. The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.13
are in addition to any other rights and remedies which the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender. 
(c) If the Company and the Administrative Agent agree in writing in their reasonable determination that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be
deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to
any cash collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Advances of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause such Advances
to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their pro rata share, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or
payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender
to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.

or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public
statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous
definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either

the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Term SOFR Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Advances to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the applicable Borrower
will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Advances. During a Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor,
the component of Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of Base Rate. 
(f) Disclaimer. The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to
(a) the continuation of, administration of, submission of, calculation of or any other matter related to the Base Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate or Term SOFR, or any component definition thereof or rates referred to in the definition
thereof, or any alternative, successor or replacement rate thereto (including any Benchmark Replacement), including whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark
Replacement) will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, or have the same volume or liquidity as, Base Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR or any other Benchmark prior to its discontinuance or unavailability,
or (b) the effect, implementation or composition of any Conforming Changes. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of Base Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate,
Term SOFR, any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrowers. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or
services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain Base Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR or any other Benchmark, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to any Borrower, any Lender or any other
person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or

other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market

discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or

Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law or any directive or regulation of any agency of the United Kingdom and the United States, including for the avoidance of doubt any
action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any bankruptcy or other debtor relief law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any bankruptcy or other debtor
relief law;  (iii) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to

8.03) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or the event or events that give or may give rise to any Default

certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith or the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the information contained therein, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the

(d) Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall require the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties to carry out any
know your customer or other checks in relation to any Person on behalf of any Lender and each Lender confirms to the Administrative Agent that it is solely responsible for any such checks it is required to carry out and that it may not

any statement made to it orally or by email and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Borrowing that by
its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless an officer of the Administrative Agent responsible for the transactions contemplated hereby
shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan, and such Lender shall not have made available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders ratable portion of such Borrowing. The Administrative Agent
may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company or any other Loan Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of
any such counsel, accountants or experts.  SECTION 7.05 Indemnification. The Lenders severally agree to indemnify the

this Agreement and the Notes, or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the Notes, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the Administrative Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification,

expenses by the Company.  SECTION 7.06 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties
and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. Each such sub-agent and the Related Parties
of the Administrative Agent and each such sub-agent shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article 7 and Section 8.04 (as though such
sub-agents were the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any sub-agents affecting any of the other Lenders except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted
with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub agents.  SECTION 7.07 Resignation of Administrative
Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Company. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Company,
to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in New York, and which successor shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. If no such successor shall have been so
appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the
Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed,
such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.  (b) If the Person serving as
Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Company and such Person remove such Person as
Administrative Agent and appoint a successor, which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such
earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Removal Effective Date), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.

retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required

privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all
of its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed

succeeding clause (b)) that any funds (as set forth in such notice from the Administrative Agent) received by such Payment Recipient from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates were erroneously or mistakenly transmitted to, or otherwise

payment, prepayment or repayment; and  (ii) such Lender shall (and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of the occurrence of any of the circumstances described in immediately preceding clauses (x), (y) and (z)) notify
the Administrative Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 7.11(b). 
For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to deliver a notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 7.11(b) shall not have any effect on a
Payment Recipients obligations pursuant to Section 7.11(a) or on whether or not an Erroneous Payment has been made.  (c) Each
Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender under any Loan

respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency), upon the Administrative Agents notice to such Lender at any time, then effective immediately (with the consideration therefor being
acknowledged by the parties hereto), (A) such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Advances (but not its Commitments ) in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may

foregoing assignment), (B) the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to have acquired the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (C) upon such deemed acquisition, the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall
become a Lender, as applicable, hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender shall cease to be a Lender, as applicable, hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment,
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender, (D) the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall
each be deemed to have waived any consents required under this Agreement to any such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and (E) the Administrative Agent will reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the Advances subject to the
Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender and such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 (ii) Subject to Section 8.07 (but excluding, in all events, any assignment consent or approval requirements (whether
from the Company or otherwise)), the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Advances acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return
Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Advance (or portion thereof), and the Administrative Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender (and/or against any
recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf). In addition, an Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender (x) shall be reduced by the proceeds of prepayments or repayments of principal and interest, or other
distribution in respect of principal and interest, received by the Administrative Agent on or with respect to any such Advances acquired from such Lender pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment (to the extent that any such Advances
are then owned by the Administrative Agent) and (y) may, in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent, be reduced by any amount specified by the Administrative Agent in writing to the applicable Lender from time to time. 
(e) The parties hereto agree that (x) irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent may be equitably subrogated, in the event that an
Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered from any Payment Recipient that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights and interests of such
Payment Recipient (and, in the case of any Payment Recipient who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, to the rights and interests of such Lender) under the Loan Documents with respect to such amount (the Erroneous Payment Subrogation
Rights) (provided that the Loan Parties obligations under the Loan Documents in respect of the Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights shall not be duplicative of such obligations in respect of Advances that have been assigned to the
Administrative Agent under an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment) and (y) an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any obligations owed hereunder by the Company or any other Loan Party; provided
that this Section 7.11 shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for),

or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder relative to the amount (and/or timing for payment) of the obligations of the
Borrowers hereunder that would have been payable had such Erroneous Payment not been made by the Administrative Agent; provided, further, that for the avoidance of doubt, immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y) shall not apply
to the extent any such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrowers for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment. 
(f) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives,
and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment
received, including, without limitation, any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine.  (g) Each
partys obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 7.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the
Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations of the Borrowers (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.

each user may access the Approved Electronic Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the Lenders and each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that the distribution
of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution. In consideration for the convenience and other benefits afforded by such distribution and for

Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in

For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received
from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential
basis prior to disclosure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that, in the case of information received from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of
delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to
maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.  (e) Treatment of
Information. (i) Certain of the Lenders may enter into this Agreement and take or not take action hereunder or under the other Loan Documents on the basis of information that does not contain material
non-public information with respect to any of the Loan Parties or their securities (Restricting Information). Other Lenders may enter into this Agreement and take or not take action
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents on the basis of information that may contain Restricting Information. Each Lender acknowledges that United States federal and state securities laws prohibit any person from purchasing or selling securities
on the basis of material, non-public information concerning the issuer of such securities or, subject to certain limited exceptions, from communicating such information to any other Person. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall, by making any Communications (including Restricting Information) available to a Lender, by participating in any conversations or other interactions with a Lender or otherwise, make or be
deemed to make any statement with regard to or otherwise warrant that any such information or Communication does or does not contain Restricting Information nor shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties be responsible or liable in
any way for any decision a Lender may make to limit or to not limit its access to Restricting Information. In particular, none of the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (i) shall have, and the Administrative Agent, on behalf of
itself and each of its Related Parties, hereby disclaims, any duty to ascertain or inquire as to whether or not a Lender has or has not limited its access to Restricting Information, such Lenders policies or procedures regarding the
safeguarding of material, nonpublic information or such Lenders compliance with applicable laws related thereto or (ii) shall have, or incur, any liability to any Loan Party or Lender or any of their respective Related Parties arising out
of or relating to the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties providing or not providing Restricting Information to any Lender. 
(ii) Each Loan Party agrees that (i) all Communications it provides to the Administrative Agent intended for delivery to the Lenders
whether by posting to the Approved Electronic Platform or otherwise shall be clearly and conspicuously marked PUBLIC if such Communications do not contain Restricting Information which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word
PUBLIC shall appear prominently on the first page thereof, (ii) by marking Communications PUBLIC, each Loan Party shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to treat such Communications
as either publicly available information or not material information (although, in this latter case, such Communications may contain sensitive business information and, therefore, remain subject to the confidentiality undertakings of
Section 8.02(c)) with respect to such Loan Party or its securities for purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws, (iii) all 
  364-DAY
CREDIT AGREEMENT  59 





Communications marked PUBLIC may be delivered to all Lenders and may be made available through a portion of the Approved Electronic Platform designated Public Side
Information, and (iv) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to treat any Communications that are not marked PUBLIC as Restricting Information and may post such Communications to a portion of the Approved Electronic
Platform not designated Public Side Information. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible for any statement or other designation by a Loan Party regarding whether a Communication contains or does
not contain material non-public information with respect to any of the Loan Parties or their securities nor shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates incur any liability to any Loan Party, any
Lender or any other Person for any action taken by the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates based upon such statement or designation, including any action as a result of which Restricting Information is provided to a Lender that may decide
not to take access to Restricting Information. Nothing in this clause (ii) shall modify or limit a Lenders obligations under Section 8.02(b) with regard to Communications and the maintenance of the confidentiality of or
other treatment of Information.  (iii) Each Lender acknowledges that circumstances may arise that require it to refer to Communications
that might contain Restricting Information. Accordingly, each Lender agrees that it will nominate at least one designee to receive Communications (including Restricting Information) on its behalf and identify such designee (including such
designees contact information) on such Lenders Administrative Questionnaire. Each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time of such Lenders designees e-mail
address to which notice of the availability of Restricting Information may be sent by electronic transmission.  (iv) Each Lender
acknowledges that Communications delivered hereunder and under the other Loan Documents may contain Restricting Information and that such Communications are available to all Lenders generally. Each Lender that elects not to take access to
Restricting Information does so voluntarily and, by such election, acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and other Lenders may have access to Restricting Information that is not available to such electing Lender. None of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender with access to Restricting Information shall have any duty to disclose such Restricting Information to such electing Lender or to use such Restricting Information on behalf of such electing Lender, and shall not be
liable for the failure to so disclose or use, such Restricting Information.  (v) The provisions of the foregoing clauses of this
subsection (d) are designed to assist the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Loan Parties, in complying with their respective contractual obligations and applicable law in circumstances where certain Lenders express a desire not to
receive Restricting Information notwithstanding that certain Communications hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or other information provided to the Lenders hereunder or thereunder may contain Restricting Information. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties warrants or makes any other statement with respect to the adequacy of such provisions to achieve such purpose nor does the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties warrant or make any
other statement to the effect that any Loan Partys or Lenders adherence to such provisions will be sufficient to ensure compliance by such Loan Party or Lender with its contractual obligations or its duties under applicable law in
respect of Restricting Information and each of the Lenders and each Loan Party assumes the risks associated therewith.

SECTION 8.03 No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. 
SECTION 8.04 Costs and Expenses; Breakage Indemnification. (a) The Company agrees to pay on demand all reasonable costs and
expenses, if any (including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses), of (i) the Administrative Agent in connection with the negotiation, syndication, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the
other documents delivered hereunder and (ii) the Administrative Agent and each Lender in connection with enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents to be

(b) If any payment, prepayment or conversion of any Term SOFR Advance is made by the Company or a Designated Borrower, as applicable, to or for
the account of a Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result of acceleration of the maturity of the Advances and the Notes pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any other reason, such Borrower shall, upon
demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses which it may
reasonably incur as a result of such payment, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund or maintain such Advance. 
(c) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender and each of their Related Parties (each, an
Indemnified Party) from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any
Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of, or in connection with the preparation for a defense of, any investigation, litigation or proceeding arising out of, related to or in connection with the actual or
proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances, including in connection with any acquisition or proposed acquisition by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company of another Person or one or more businesses of another Person (whether by means of a
stock purchase, asset acquisition or otherwise), whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Company, its directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person or any Indemnified Party is
otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense is found in a final, non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Partys gross negligence or willful misconduct.

(d) The Company agrees not to assert any claim against the Administrative Agent, any Lender
or any of their Related Parties on any theory of liability, for consequential, indirect, special or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the actual or proposed use
of the proceeds of the Advances.  (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Loan Parties hereunder, the
agreements and obligations of the Loan Parties contained in Sections 2.08, 2.10 and 8.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the Notes. 
SECTION 8.05 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the
exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Advances owing to it (other than pursuant to Section 2.02(d), 2.06, 2.08, 2.10, 8.04(b) or 8.07) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Advances obtained by
all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent
of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lenders ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lenders required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Company agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 8.05 may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Company in the amount of such participation. 
SECTION 8.06 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, each Designated
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Loan Party shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder or under any Note or any interest herein or therein (other
than as permitted by Section 5.02(b)) without the prior written consent of all of the Lenders.  SECTION 8.07 Successors and
Assigns. (a) Successors and Assigns Generally. No Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this
Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of paragraph (e) of this
Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders)
any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

(b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more
assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Advances at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
 (i) Minimum Amounts. 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment and/or the Advances
at the time owing to it or contemporaneous assignments that equal at least the amount specified in paragraph (b)(i)(B) of this Section in the aggregate or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, no
minimum amount need be assigned; and  (B) in any case not described in paragraph (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the
aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Advances outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Advances of the assigning Lender subject to each
such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade
Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consents
(each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  (ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment
shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Advance or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit
any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate facilities on a non-pro rata basis. 
(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by
paragraph (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:  (A) the consent of the Company (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment, or (y) such assignment is to an Affiliate of such Lender or a Lender; provided that
the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten Business Days after having received notice thereof; and 
  364-DAY
CREDIT AGREEMENT  63 




(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of any Commitments or Advances if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender or an Affiliate of such Lender. 
(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The
assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.  (v) No
Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Company or any of the Companys Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a
Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B).  (vi) No Assignment
to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural Person.  (vii) Certain Additional Payments. In
connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall
make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations, or other compensating actions,
including funding, with the consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Advances previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby
irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as
appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Advances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with
the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the
assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party 
  364-DAY
CREDIT AGREEMENT  64 





hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.08 and 8.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment;
provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a
Defaulting Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such
rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section.  (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting
solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 8.02 a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the
Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Advances owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). In addition, the Administrative Agent shall give
prompt written notice to the Company of its receipt and recording of any Assignment and Assumption. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from
time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  (d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to,
the Company or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person or the Company or any of the Companys Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such
Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Advances owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent, and Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 7.05 with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its
Participant(s).  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall
retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of
the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to the following: (A) any reduction in principal, interest or fees payable to such Lender under this Agreement, (B) the postponement of any date fixed for the
payment of any principal, interest or fees under this Agreement and (C) any amendments to the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) that affects such Participant. The Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.08, 2.10 and 8.04 (subject to the requirements and limitations herein, including Section 8.08 and the requirements under Section 8.09 (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 8.09 shall be
delivered to the Lender that sold such 
  364-DAY
CREDIT AGREEMENT  65 





participation)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant
(A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 8.10 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.08 or 2.10, with respect to
any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change in law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable
participation. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.09(b) as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 8.05 as though
it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a nonfiduciary agent of the Company, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and
stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Advances or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion
of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except
to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States
Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes
of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
(e) Certain Pledges. Anything in this Section 8.07 to the contrary notwithstanding, any Lender may assign and pledge all or any
portion of its rights to payment of the Advances owing to it hereunder, including (i) to any Federal Reserve Bank (and its transferees) as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
and any applicable Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank or Central Bank or (ii) to any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender. No such assignment shall have the effect of releasing such Lender from its obligations
hereunder.  SECTION 8.08 Limitation on Assignments and Participations. (a) Any Lender may, in connection with any actual
or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to Section 8.07, disclose to the actual or proposed assignee or participant any information relating to any Loan Party furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of such Loan Party; provided that,
to the extent required pursuant to Section 8.02(d), the actual or proposed assignee or participant shall have agreed prior to any such disclosure to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to such Loan Party
received by it from such Lender or such Loan Party.  (b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 8.07 to the contrary, no Lender shall
have the right to assign its rights and obligations hereunder or any interest therein or to sell participations to one or more banks or other financial institutions in all or a portion of its rights hereunder or any interest therein where the result
of such assignment or participation would be reasonably expected to entitle the Lender to claim additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.02(d), 2.06, 2.08, 2.10 or 8.04 or would otherwise result in an increase in a Borrowers obligations.

SECTION 8.09 Withholding. (a) If any Lender, or any Person that becomes a
party to this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.07, is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, such Person agrees that, prior to the first date on which any payment is due to it hereunder, it will
deliver to each of the Company and the Administrative Agent (i) two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI or successor applicable form, as the case may be, certifying in each case that such Person is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement, without deduction or withholding of any United States federal
income taxes, and (ii) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E or successor applicable form, or any other Internal Revenue Service Form prescribed by
applicable law, as the case may be, to establish an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Each Person which delivers to the Company the relevant Form pursuant to the preceding sentence further undertakes to deliver to each of the
Company and the Administrative Agent two further copies of the relevant Form, or successor applicable forms, or other manner of certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Company and the Administrative Agent, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by the Company or the Administrative
Agent, certifying that such Person is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless in any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in
treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Person from duly completing and delivering any such form with
respect to it and such Person advises the Company and the Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax, and in the case of a
Form W-8BEN-E or any other Internal Revenue Service Form prescribed by applicable law, establishing an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. 
(b) Each Lender described in Section 8.09(a) above, or that is otherwise treated as a non-U.S.
financial institution pursuant to FATCA, shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation
prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the
Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
Solely for purposes of this clause (b), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
SECTION 8.10 Mitigation. In the event that any Lender claims any amounts under Sections 2.02(d), 2.06, 2.08, 2.10 or 8.04(b), it
shall use all reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policies and legal and regulatory restrictions) to take actions (including, without limitation, changing the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office) so as to eliminate such
additional amounts; provided that such Lender shall not be required to take any action if, in its reasonable judgment, such action would be materially disadvantageous to it.
