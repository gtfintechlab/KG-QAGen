pursuant to Section 6.07 in connection with such transaction or series of related transactions) or a Subsidiary of the Borrower (or a Person that becomes a Subsidiary of the Borrower as a result of such transaction) is the surviving entity;
provided, further that any Person that is a Subsidiary at the time of execution of the definitive agreement related to any such transaction or series of related concurrent transactions (or, in the case of a tender offer or similar

its Subsidiaries is contingent upon the 
  1

conversion powers of such EEA Resolution Authority from time to time under the Bail-In Legislation for the applicable EEA Member Country, which write-down and conversion powers are described in the EU Bail-In Legislation Schedule.  The foregoing definitions shall be equally applicable to both the
singular and plural forms of the defined terms.  Any accounting terms used in this Agreement which are not specifically defined herein
shall have the meanings customarily given them in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles.  Section 1.02
References. Any references to the Borrowers Subsidiaries shall not in any way be construed as consent by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to the establishment, maintenance or acquisition of any Subsidiary, except as may otherwise
be permitted hereunder.  Section 1.03 Exchange Rates, Basket Calculations, Eurocurrency Rate.
(a) The Administrative Agent shall determine the Exchange Rate in respect of each Revaluation Date to be used for calculating Dollar Equivalent amounts of Loans denominated in Foreign Currencies. Such Exchange Rates shall become effective as of
such Revaluation Date and shall be the Exchange Rates employed in converting any amounts between the applicable currencies until the next Revaluation Date to occur. Except for purposes of financial statements delivered by the Borrower hereunder or
calculating financial covenants hereunder or except as otherwise provided herein, the applicable amount of any currency (other than Dollars) for purposes of the Loan Documents shall be such Dollar Equivalent amount as so determined by the
Administrative Agent based on the Exchange Rate in respect of the date of such determination as if such date were the Revaluation Date. 
  22 




(b) Wherever in this Agreement in connection with a Borrowing, conversion, continuation or
prepayment of a Eurocurrency Loan, an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Borrowing or Eurocurrency Loan is denominated in a Foreign Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Foreign Currency
equivalent of such Dollar amount (rounded to the nearest unit of such Foreign Currency, with 0.5 of a unit being rounded upward), as determined by the Administrative Agent on the basis of the Exchange Rate (determined in respect of the most recent
Revaluation Date).  (c) For purposes of determining compliance with Section 6.09, no Unmatured Default or Default shall be deemed to
have occurred solely as a result of changes in Exchange Rates occurring after the time any Lien is created or incurred.  (d) For purposes
of determining compliance with Section 6.10, the amount of Indebtedness for Borrowed Money denominated in any currency other than Dollars will be converted into Dollars based on the relevant Exchange Rate(s) in effect as of the last day of the
fiscal quarter of the Borrower for which the ratio of Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization is calculated.  (e) The Administrative
Agent does not warrant, nor accept responsibility, nor shall the Administrative Agent have any liability with respect to the administration, submission or any other matter related to the rates in the definition of Eurocurrency Rate or
with respect to any comparable or successor rate thereto.  Section 1.04 Change of Currency. (a) Each
obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement to make a payment denominated in the national currency unit of any member state of the European Union that adopts the Euro in accordance with the legislation of the European Union relating to Economic
and Monetary Union as its lawful currency after the date hereof shall be redenominated into Euro at the time of such adoption, provided that if and to the extent that such legislation or member state provides that any such obligation may be paid by
debtors in either the Euro or such other currency, then the Borrower shall be permitted to repay such amount either in the Euro or such other currency. If, in relation to the currency of any such member state, the basis of accrual of interest
expressed in this Agreement in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the London interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced by such
convention or practice with effect from the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency; provided that if any borrowing in the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such
replacement shall take effect, with respect to such borrowing, at the end of the then-current Interest Period.  (b) Each provision of this
Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be reasonably necessary to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant
market conventions or practices relating to the Euro. 
  23 




(c) Each provision of this Agreement also shall be subject to such reasonable changes of
construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be reasonably necessary to reflect a change in currency of any other country and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the change in currency. 
ARTICLE II  THE CREDITS
 Section 2.01 Description of Facility; Commitments. (a) From and including the Effective
Date and prior to the Facility Termination Date, upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.03, each Lender severally and not jointly agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to make Loans
to the Borrower from time to time in amounts not to exceed in the aggregate at any one time outstanding its Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Commitment; provided that after giving effect to such Loans, (a) the aggregate principal Dollar
Equivalent of all Lenders Loans outstanding at such time, after giving effect to any borrowings and prepayments or repayments of any Loans occurring on such date, shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitment at such time and (b) with
respect to any Lender, the aggregate principal Dollar Equivalent of such Lenders Loans outstanding at such time, after giving effect to any borrowings and prepayments or repayments of any Loans occurring on such date, shall not
exceed such Lenders Commitment at such time, which Loans (other than Alternate Base Rate Loans) may, at the Borrowers election, be denominated in Dollars or a Foreign Currency. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Borrower may
borrow, repay and reborrow Loans at any time prior to the Facility Termination Date. Each Borrowing of Loans shall be in a minimum aggregate principal amount of (x) in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars, $10,000,000 or any integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (y) in the case of Loans denominated in Euro, 10,000,000 or any integral multiple of 1,000,000 in excess thereof and (z) in the case of Loans denominated in Sterling, £10,000,000
or any integral multiple of £1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, in each case, if less, the unused Aggregate Commitment as of such date). The Commitments to lend hereunder shall expire automatically on the Facility Termination Date. Each Loan
shall be made by each Lender in accordance with such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Commitment.  (b) The Borrower may at
any time from time to time, upon prior written notice by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, increase the Commitments by a maximum aggregate amount of up to One Billion Dollars ($1,000,000,000) with additional Commitments from any existing
Lenders and/or with new Commitments from any other Person selected by the Borrower and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent; provided that: 
(i) any such increase shall be in a minimum principal amount of $10,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof;  (ii) no Default or Unmatured Default shall exist and be continuing at the time of any such increase; 
  24 




(iii) no existing Lender shall be under any obligation to increase its
Commitment and any such decision whether to increase its Commitment shall be in such Lenders sole and absolute discretion; 
(iv) (A) any new Lender shall join this Agreement by executing such joinder documents required by the Administrative Agent
and/or (B) any existing Lender electing to increase its Commitment shall have executed a commitment agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; and 
(v) as a condition precedent to such increase, the Borrower shall (x) deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate
dated as of the date of such increase signed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower (A) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving or consenting to such increase, and (B) certifying that, before and after
giving effect to such increase, (1) the representations and warranties contained in Article V are true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent such representations and warranties are qualified with materiality or
Material Adverse Effect or similar terms, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the date of such increase, except to the extent that such representations and warranties
specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent such representations and warranties are qualified with materiality or Material Adverse Effect or
similar terms, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of such earlier date and (2) no Default or Unmatured Default exists immediately before or after giving effect to the
incurrence of such increase and (y) pay any applicable fee related to such increase (including, without limitation, any applicable arrangement, upfront and/or administrative fee). 
In connection with the effectiveness of any increase under this Section 2.01(b), (x) the Commitment Schedule shall be deemed amended to
reflect such increase and the updated Commitments and Pro Rata Shares of the Lenders, (y) the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the updated Commitment Schedule and (z) to the extent necessary to
keep any outstanding Loans allocated ratably to the Lenders in accordance with their updated Pro Rata Shares, the Borrower shall prepay (or, if the Administrative Agent determines in its sole discretion that a
re-allocation of the Loans can be accomplished without any cash prepayments or new cash Loans by the Lenders, be deemed to have prepaid) any Loans owing by it (or such Borrower, as applicable) and outstanding
on the date of any such increase (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.04). The provisions of this Section 2.01(b) involving non-pro rata allocations, prepayments and Loans
shall supersede any provisions in Sections 2.19 or 8.02 to the contrary.  Section 2.02 Extension of Maturity
Date(a). (a) The Borrower may extend the Maturity Date with respect to the Revolving Facility for additional periods of 364 days or eighteen months (a Maturity Date Extension) by providing written notice of such request to the
Administrative Agent not more than 90 days and not less than 30 days prior to the Maturity Date 
  25 





then in effect (such anniversary of the Maturity Date, the Extension Date). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such request and each Lender shall
then, in its sole discretion, notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing within 10 Business Days after such request whether such Lender will consent to the extension (each such Lender consenting to the applicable extension, a
Consenting Lender). The failure of any Lender to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its intent to consent to an extension shall be deemed a rejection by such Lender, as applicable. Such extension shall be
effective as to Consenting Lenders under the Revolving Facility consenting to such extension if the Required Lenders approve such Maturity Date Extension; provided, in each case, that (A) the Maturity Date following any such extension
shall not be a date that is more than eighteen months after the applicable Extension Date and (B) at the existing Maturity Date in effect prior to each Maturity Date Extension, (1) the commitments of Lenders that did not consent to such
Maturity Date Extension (each such Lender not consenting to the extension, a Declining Lender) will be terminated and the Loans of such Lenders will be repaid (it being understood that the commitments of the Declining Lenders not
consenting to such extension will remain in effect until the Maturity Date originally applicable to such Lenders) and (2) the Borrower shall make such additional prepayments as shall be necessary in order that the Loans hereunder immediately
after such existing Maturity Date will not exceed, respectively, the Aggregate Commitments.  (b) The consent of Declining Lenders will not
be required; provided that Consenting Lenders constituting the Required Lenders have approved such Maturity Date Extension; provided that the Borrower shall have the right, at any time prior to the existing Maturity Date, to obtain the
signatures of the Required Lenders by replacing Declining Lenders with Consenting Lenders willing (in their sole discretion) to increase their existing commitments (each such Lender, an Extending Lender), or other financial
institutions willing (in their sole discretion) to become Lenders and extend new commitments, on terms consistent with Section 2.17 (each such Lender, a New Lender), in each case on the existing Maturity Date. If any Lender
rejects, or is deemed to have rejected, the Borrowers request for an extension, the Borrower may replace Declining Lenders with Extending Lenders or New Lenders, in each case on the existing Maturity Date. In connection with any such
replacement pursuant to this clause (b), the Administrative Agent shall enter in the Register (A) the names of any New Lenders, (B) the Maturity Date applicable to each Lender and (C) the respective allocations of any Declining
Lenders, Consenting Lenders, Extending Lenders and New Lenders effective as of the Maturity Date applicable thereto. No action by or consent of any Declining Lender shall be necessary in connection with such assignment. In connection with any such
assignment, the Borrower, Administrative Agent, such Declining Lender and the replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with Section 12.01; provided that if such Declining Lender does not comply with Section 12.01 within five
(5) Business Days after the Borrowers request, compliance with Section 12.01 (but only on the part of the Declining Lender) shall not be required to effect such assignment. 
(c) If any financial institution or other entity becomes a New Lender or any Extending Lenders Commitment is increased pursuant to
Section 2.02(b), (x) Loans made on or after the existing Maturity Date shall be made in accordance with Section 2.01(a) or (b), as applicable, based on the respective Commitments in effect on and after the existing Maturity

  26 





Date and (y) if, on the date of such joinder or increase, there are any Loans outstanding, such Loans shall on or prior to such date be prepaid from the proceeds of new Loans made hereunder
(reflecting such additional Lender or increase), which prepayment shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the applicable Loans being prepaid and any costs incurred by any Lender in accordance with Section 3.04. 
(d) Each such Maturity Date Extension will not be effective as to any Lender unless (a) no Default or Unmatured Default shall have
occurred and be continuing on or as of the date of such extension and (b) all representations and warranties of the Borrower set forth in Article V shall be true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent such representations
and warranties are qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect or similar terms, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all respects) as if made on and as of the date of such
extension, except to the extent a representation or warranty is stated to relate solely to an earlier date, in which case the representation or warranty shall be true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent such representations
and warranties are qualified with materiality or Material Adverse Effect or similar terms, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as such earlier date. 
(e) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of the effectiveness of each extension pursuant to this Section 2.02. 
Section 2.03 [Reserved]. 
Section 2.04 Types of Loans. The Loans may consist of Alternate Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Loans, or a
combination thereof, selected by the Borrower in accordance with Sections 2.08 and 2.09.  Section 2.05 Fees;
Reductions in Aggregate Commitment. (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee in Dollars (the Commitment Fee) at
a per annum rate equal to the Commitment Fee Rate on the daily actual excess of such Lenders Commitment over the outstanding principal Dollar Equivalent of such Lenders outstanding Loans (such excess, such Lenders Actual
Unused Commitments) as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.05(c), accruing from and including the Effective Date to and including the date on which the Commitments have been terminated in full and all Obligations hereunder have been paid
in full pursuant to Section 2.07(c), payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date; provided that no Commitment Fee shall accrue hereunder with respect to the Actual Unused Commitment of a Defaulting Lender so long as such Lender
shall be a Defaulting Lender.  (b) Fee Letter. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account and for the
ratable account of each of the Lenders, as applicable, the fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall be non-refundable for any reason
whatsoever. 
  27 




(c) Voluntary Reductions in Aggregate Commitment. The Borrower shall have the right,
upon same day written notice to the Administrative Agent delivered prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on any Business Day, to terminate in whole or reduce in part the unused portions of the Commitments of the Lenders at the election of the
Borrower. Each partial reduction of the Commitments shall be in the aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and, once terminated, a Commitment may not be reinstated. The Administrative Agent will
promptly notify the Lenders of any termination or reduction of the Commitments under this Section 2.05(c). Each voluntary reduction of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) will be applied to the outstanding Commitments of each
Lender in accordance with such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Facility. All fees in respect of the Commitments (including any Commitment Fees) accrued until the effective date of any termination of such Commitments shall be paid on
the effective date of such termination. For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall not be permitted to terminate in whole or reduce in part the Commitments to the extent that, after giving effect to such termination, the then outstanding Dollar
Equivalent of Loans would exceed the Aggregate Commitment.  (d) Automatic Reductions in Commitments. The Aggregate Commitment shall
terminate on the Facility Termination Date.  Section 2.06 [Reserved]. 
Section 2.07 Prepayments and Repayments. (a) Optional Prepayments. The Borrower may from
time to time pay, without penalty or premium, all of its outstanding Alternate Base Rate Loans, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, any portion of its outstanding Alternate Base
Rate Loans upon prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which may be in a form on an electronic platform or electronic transmission system as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent) (stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount
of the applicable prepayment) at or before 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date of such payment. The Borrower may from time to time pay, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.04 but without penalty
or premium, all of its outstanding Eurocurrency Loans, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of (x) in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars, $10,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (y) in the case of Loans
denominated in Euro, 10,000,000 or any integral multiple of 1,000,000 in excess thereof and (z) in the case of Loans denominated in Sterling, £10,000,000 or any integral multiple of £1,000,000 in excess thereof, any
portion of its outstanding Eurocurrency Loans upon prior notice to the Administrative Agent (stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the applicable prepayment) at or before 1:00 p.m. (New York time) at least two
(2) Business Days prior, in the case of any Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars, and at least four (4) Business Days prior, in the case of any Eurocurrency Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, to the date of such payment (or,
subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts, if any, required by Section 3.04, such other prior notice as the Administrative Agent may agree to). Subject to Section 2.20, each such prepayment shall be applied to the Loans
outstanding at 
  28 





the direction of the Borrower and will be applied to the outstanding Loans of each Lender in accordance with such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Facility. 
(b) Mandatory Prepayments. If the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower, at any time, that the Dollar Equivalent with respect to
Loans denominated in any Foreign Currency plus the then outstanding amount of Loans denominated in Dollars, exceeds the Aggregate Commitment, then the Borrower shall within five business days, prepay such Loans or take such other action, in
each case, to the extent necessary to eliminate any such excess.  (c) Repayments. The Borrower shall pay any unpaid principal of
and accrued and unpaid Obligations on or relating to the Loans in full on the Facility Termination Date. This Agreement shall terminate on the earlier to occur of (i) the Facility Termination Date and (ii) if the Effective Date has not
occurred by such date, February 15, 2019. Notwithstanding any such termination, until all of the Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations) shall have been fully paid and satisfied and all financing arrangements among the
Borrower and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall have been terminated, all of the rights and remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall survive. 
Section 2.08 Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New Loans. The Borrower shall
select the Type of Borrowing and, in the case of each Eurocurrency Loan, the Interest Period applicable thereto from time to time. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice (which notice may be conditioned on the satisfaction or waiver
(in accordance with Section 8.02) of the conditions set forth in Section 4.03) by a borrowing notice substantially in the form of Exhibit D or such other form as may be approved by the Administrative Agent (including any form on an
electronic platform or electronic transmission system as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent), in each case appropriately completed and signed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower (a Borrowing Notice);
provided that each such Borrowing Notice must be received no later than (x) 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the date of the proposed borrowing of each Alternate Base Rate Loan, (y) 11:00 a.m. (New York time) two (2) Business Days before
the date of the proposed borrowing of each Eurocurrency Loan denominated in Dollars and (z) 11:00 a.m. (New York time) four (4) Business Days before the Borrowing Date for each Eurocurrency Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency. A Borrowing
Notice shall specify:  (a) the date of the proposed borrowing, which shall be a Business Day, of such Loans, 
(b) the aggregate amount and currency of the Loans comprising the proposed borrowing (which Loan shall be in a minimum aggregate principal
amount of (x) in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars, $10,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (y) in the case of Loans denominated in Euro, 10,000,000 or any integral multiple of 1,000,000 in
excess thereof and (z) in the case of Loans denominated in Sterling, £10,000,000 or any integral multiple of £1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, in each case, if less, the unused Aggregate Commitment as of such date)), 
  29 




(c) the Type of Borrowing selected, and 
(d) in the case of a proposed borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Loans, the Interest Period applicable thereto. 
The location and number of the Borrowers account to which proceeds of the Loans are to be disbursed shall be set forth in written
settlement instructions executed by two Authorized Officers of the Borrower (neither of which shall hold the title of Vice President, Global Treasury) and the Administrative Agent shall have confirmed such location and number of the Borrowers
account to which proceeds of a Loan are to be disbursed orally by telephone. Any change to the location and number of the Borrowers account to which proceeds of a Loan are to be disbursed shall be set forth in written settlement instructions
executed by two Authorized Officers of the Borrower (neither of which shall hold the title of Vice President, Global Treasury) and the Administrative Agent shall have confirmed such change to the location and number of the Borrowers account to
which proceeds of a Loan are to be disbursed orally by telephone.  If the Borrower fails to specify a currency in a Borrowing Notice
requesting a Loan, then the Loan so requested shall be made in Dollars.  No more than ten (10) Interest Periods shall be in effect at
any time (unless such limit has been waived by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion).  Section 2.09
Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Loans. Alternate Base Rate Loans shall continue as Alternate Base Rate Loans unless and until such Alternate Base Rate Loans are converted into Eurocurrency Loans pursuant to this
Section 2.09 or are prepaid or repaid in accordance with Section 2.07. Each Eurocurrency Loan shall continue as a Eurocurrency Loan until the end of the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time such Eurocurrency Loan shall
be automatically converted into an Alternate Base Rate Loan (provided, that in the case of a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, such Eurocurrency Loan shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Loan in its original currency with
an Interest Period of one month), unless (x) such Eurocurrency Loan is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.07 or (y) the Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice (as defined below)
requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurocurrency Loan continue as a Eurocurrency Loan for the same or another Interest Period. The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part of an Alternate Base Rate Loan
into a Eurocurrency Loan. No Loan may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in the other currency. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 2.09 (except with the consent of the Required Lenders) when any Default has occurred and is continuing each Eurocurrency Loan shall be continued as a Loan in its original currency with an Interest Period
not longer than one month. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice substantially in the form of Exhibit E or such other form as may be approved by the Administrative Agent (including any form on an electronic

  30 





platform or electronic transmission system as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent), in each case appropriately completed and signed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower (a
Conversion/Continuation Notice) of each conversion of an Alternate Base Rate Loan into a Eurocurrency Loan or a continuation of a Eurocurrency Loan, with each such Conversion/Continuation Notice to be received not later than 11:00
a.m. (New York time) at least two (2) Business Days, in the case of any Loans denominated in Dollars, and at least four (4) Business Days, in the case of any Eurocurrency Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, prior to the date of the
requested conversion or continuation, specifying:  (a) the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such conversion or
continuation,  (b) the aggregate amount and Type of the Loan which is to be converted or continued as a Eurocurrency Loan, and 
(c) the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto. 
Section 2.10 Interest Rates. Each Alternate Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Loan is made or is converted from a Eurocurrency Loan into an Alternate Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 2.09 hereof, to but excluding the date it is paid or is converted
into a Eurocurrency Loan pursuant to Section 2.09 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Loan maintained as an Alternate Base
Rate Loan will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Each Eurocurrency Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the first day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at the Eurocurrency Rate for the applicable period plus the Applicable Margin. No Interest Period may end after the Maturity Date. 
Section 2.11 Rates Applicable After Default. During the continuance of a Default under
Section 7.02 the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.02 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders
to changes in interest rates, and which election and notice shall not be required after a Default or Unmatured Default under Section 7.05 or 7.06), declare that interest on the overdue amount of the Loans shall be payable at a rate (after as
well as before the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws) equal to 2% per annum in excess of the rate otherwise payable thereon (and, with respect to any other overdue amounts, shall bear interest at a rate equal to the
Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin applicable to Alternate Base Rate Loans plus 2% per annum) commencing on the date of such Default and continuing until such Default is cured or waived. 
Section 2.12 Method of Payment. Except as otherwise specified herein, all payments by the Borrower of
principal, interest and its other Obligations shall be made, (i) with respect to 
  31 





Loans denominated in Dollars and the Aggregate Commitments, in Dollars, and (ii) with respect to Loans denominated in any Foreign Currency, in the applicable Foreign Currency in which such
Loans are denominated. All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents address specified pursuant to
Article XIII, or at any other Lending Installation of the Administrative Agent specified in writing by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, by 2:00 p.m. (New York time), in the case of any payments made in Dollars, and not later than the
Applicable Time, in the case of any payments made in a Foreign Currency, in each case, on the date when due and shall be applied ratably by the Administrative Agent among the Lenders entitled thereto. Each payment delivered to the Administrative
Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at such Lenders address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any
Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Administrative Agent from such Lender.  Section 2.13
Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan
made by such Lender to the Borrower from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. 
(b) The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (A) the date and the amount of each Loan made
hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (B) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, (C) the effective date and amount
of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to and accepted by it and the parties thereto pursuant to Section 12.01, (D) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lenders share
thereof, and (E) all other appropriate debits and credits as provided in this Agreement, including, without limitation, all fees, charges, expenses and interest. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the
Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control absent manifest error. 
(c) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) above shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of
the Borrower to repay its Obligations in accordance with their terms.  (d) Any Lender may request that the Loans made or to be made by it
be evidenced by a promissory note in substantially the form of Exhibit C (each, a Note). In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender such Note or Notes payable to such
Lender (or its registered assigns). Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by each such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.01) be 
  32 





represented by one or more Notes payable to the payee named therein or any assignee pursuant to Section 12.01, except to the extent that any such Lender or assignee subsequently returns any
such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in clauses (a) and (b) above. 
Section 2.14 Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Interest accrued on each Alternate Base
Rate Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Borrowing Date with respect to such Alternate Base Rate Loan and on any date on which the Alternate Base Rate Loan is prepaid, whether
due to acceleration or otherwise, and on the Facility Termination Date. Interest accrued on each Eurocurrency Loan shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period and on any date on which such Eurocurrency Loan is prepaid, whether
by acceleration or otherwise, and on the Facility Termination Date. Interest accrued on each Eurocurrency Loan having an Interest Period longer than three (3) months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval duri

Period. Interest accrued pursuant to Section 2.11 shall be payable on demand. With respect to (a) interest on all Loans (other than Alternate Base Rate Loans where the interest is based on the Alternate Base Rate), Commitment Fees
and other fees hereunder, such interest or fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year and (b) interest on Loans which are Alternate Base Rate Loans where the interest
is based on the Alternate Base Rate, such interest shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365/366-day year. Interest shall be payable for the day a Loan is made but not for the day of
any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York time), in the case of a Loan denominated in Dollars or (y) the Applicable Time, in the case of a Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, in each case, at the
place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on a Loan, any fees or any other amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on
the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest, fees and commissions in connection with such payment. 
Section 2.15 Notification of Loans, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment Reductions; Availability of
Loans. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice and prepayment notice received by it hereunder.
The Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Loan promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender and the Borrower prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Not
later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time), in the case of any Loan denominated in Dollars, and not later than the Applicable Time, in the case of any Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, in each case, on each Borrowing Date, each Lender shall make
available its Loan or Loans in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agents Office for the applicable currency. The Administrative Agent will make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the Borrower at the
Administrative Agents aforesaid address. 
  33 




Section 2.16 Lending Installations. Each
Lender may book its Loans at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued
hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in accordance with Article XIII, designate replacement or additional
Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made. 
Section 2.17 Payments Generally; Administrative Agents Clawback.
(a) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans (or, in the case of any
Alternate Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon (New York time) on the date of the proposed Borrowing of such Loans) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Loan, the Administrative Agent
may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.15 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact
made its share of the applicable Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate and
(B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Alternate Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Loan to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute
such Lenders Loan included in such Loan. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
(ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made
such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to
repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to
the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. 
  34 




A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under
this subsection (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  (b) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the
Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 9.06(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under Section 9.06(c) on any date required hereunder shall not
relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under Section 9.06(c). 
Section 2.18 Replacement of Lender. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.01
or 3.02, or if any Lender gives notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.03, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 3.05, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if a Lender fails to consent to an amendment or waiver approved by the Required Lenders as to any matter for which such Lenders consent is needed, or if any Lender is a Declining
Lender under Section 2.02, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the
restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 12.01), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be
another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:  (a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent
the assignment fee specified in Section 12.01(b)(iv);  (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the
outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.04) from the assignee (to the extent of such
outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);  (c) in the case of any such
assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.01 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.05, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
(d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable laws; 
(e) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a failure to consent to an amendment or waiver approved by the Required Lenders, such
assignee shall have consented to the relevant amendment or waiver; and  (f) in the case of any such assignment by a Declining Lender, such
assignee shall have consented to the applicable Maturity Date Extension and shall, for all purposes, constitute a Consenting Lender. 
  35 




A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto,
as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
Section 2.19 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. Except as otherwise specified herein, if any
Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate
amount of such Loans and accrued interest thereon greater than its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Facility to which it is entitled pursuant hereto, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of
such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that: 
(i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to
and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 
The Borrower for itself and solely with respect to its Obligations consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor
of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.  Section 2.20 Defaulting Lenders.
(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by
applicable law:  (i) Waivers and Amendments. That Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any
amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 8.02 and the definition of Required Lender. 
(ii) Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting 
  36 





Lender under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 8.01 or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the
Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.01), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting
Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Unmatured Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion
thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit
account (other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent (provided that such cash collateral shall be invested solely in investments
that provide for preservation of capital)) and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Default or Unmatured Default exists, to
the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under
this Agreement; and sixth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which that
Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.03 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied first to pay the Loans of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied as set forth above in this sub-clause (ii). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a
Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.20(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
(iii) Certain Fees. The Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee pursuant to
Section 2.05(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender.  (b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date
specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may
determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata 
  37 





Shares of the Revolving Facility, whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or
payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender
will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. 
ARTICLE III  YIELD
PROTECTION; TAXES  Section 3.01 Yield Protection. If, after the date of this Agreement, any
Change in Law:  (a) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurocurrency Rate); 
(b) subjects any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever (except for (i) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.05
and (ii) Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 
(c) imposes on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such
Lender;  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, continuing, converting to or maintaining any
Eurocurrency Loans or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Eurocurrency Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of
such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall be entitled to seek
compensation under this Section 3.01 based on the occurrence of a Change in Law arising solely from (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated thereunder
or issued in connection therewith or (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United
States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, unless such Lender is generally seeking compensation from other borrowers that are similarly situated to and of similar creditworthiness with respect to its similarly affected
commitments, loans and/or participations under agreements with such borrowers having provisions similar to this Section 3.01. 
Section 3.02 Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations; Certificates for Reimbursement; Delay in
Requests. (a) Changes in Capital Adequacy. If any Lender 
  38 





determines that any Change in Law after the date of this Agreement affecting such Lender or any Lending Installation of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding
capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such
Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such
Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such
reduction suffered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall be entitled to seek compensation under this Section 3.02 based on the occurrence of a Change in Law arising solely from (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated thereunder or issued in connection therewith or (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, unless such Lender is generally seeking compensation from other borrowers that are similarly
situated to and of similar creditworthiness with respect to its similarly affected commitments, loans and/or participations under agreements with such borrowers having provisions similar to this Section 3.02. 
(b) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such
Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Section 3.01 or subsection (a) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay to such Lender the amount
shown as due on any such certificate within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof.  (c) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay
on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section or Section 3.01 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall
not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section or Section 3.01 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower
of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).  (d) Additional Reserve
Requirements. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of
the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurocurrency Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to
the actual costs allocated to 
  39 





such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is
payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have received at least 30 days prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional costs from such Lender. Such Lender shall deliver a certificate to the Borrower
setting forth in reasonable detail a calculation of such actual costs incurred by such Lender and shall certify that it is generally charging such costs to similarly situated customers of similar creditworthiness of the applicable Lender under
agreements having provisions similar to this Section 3.02(d) after consideration of such factors as such Lender then reasonably determines to be relevant (which determination shall be made in good faith). If a Lender fails to give notice 30
days prior to the relevant Payment Date, such additional costs shall be due and payable 30 days from receipt of such notice. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid under this Section 3.02(d) shall be without duplication of eurocurrency
adjustments in the definition of Eurocurrency Rate.  Section 3.03 Illegality.
If any Lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Installation to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Loans, or to determine
or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Foreign Currency in the London
interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Loans or to convert Alternate Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Loans shall be
suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Loans of such Lender to Alternate Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may
lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on
the amount so prepaid or converted.  Section 3.04 Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of
any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall, promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than an Alternate Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of
the Interest Period for such Loan or other than upon at least two (2) Business Days, in the case of any Loans denominated in Dollars, and at least four (4) Business Days, in the case of any Eurocurrency Loans denominated in a
Foreign Currency, prior notice to the Administrative Agent (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise, but excluding any prepayment or conversion required pursuant to Section 3.03); 
  40 




(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make
a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than an Alternate Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount or currency notified by the Borrower; or 
(c) any assignment of a Eurocurrency Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18;  including any foreign exchange losses and loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds
obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged
by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.  For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this
Section 3.04, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for such currency and for a
comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Loan was in fact so funded. 
Section 3.05 Taxes. (a) Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments
on Account of Taxes. (i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to the extent permitted by applicable laws be made free and clear of and
without reduction or withholding for any Taxes. If, however, applicable laws require the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Administrative Agent) to withhold or deduct any Tax, such Tax shall be
withheld or deducted in accordance with such laws as determined by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below. 
(ii) If the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by applicable law to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any
payment, then (A) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to be required based upon the information and
documentation it, or the applicable taxing authority, has received pursuant to subsection (e) below (for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of any such information and documentation received by an applicable taxing authority, solely to the
extent the Borrower or the Administrative Agent has been provided with a copy of such information and documentation or otherwise has actual knowledge of such information and documentation and, in each case, is entitled to rely thereon), (B) the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made
on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all 
  41 





required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or any Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such withholding or deduction been made.  (b) Payment of Other Taxes. Without limiting the provisions of subsection
(a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable laws. 
(c) Indemnification. (i) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, the Borrower shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, and shall make payment in respect thereof within thirty (30) days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) withheld or deducted by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The Borrower shall also indemnify the Administrative Agent and shall make payment in respect
thereof within thirty (30) days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required by clause (ii)(x)(1) of this subsection. A certificate as to the amount of any
such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(ii) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, each Lender shall, and does hereby, indemnify
(x) the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within thirty (30) days after demand therefor, against any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and
expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Borrower or the Administrative Agent by any Governmental Authority as a result of (1) the
failure by such Lender to deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any documentation required to be delivered by such Lender to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (e) or (2) the
failure of such Lender to comply with the provisions of Section 12.01(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (y) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes attributable to such Lender (but
only to the extent the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) or Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, and any
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and
apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the 
  42 





Administrative Agent under this clause (ii). The agreements in this clause (ii) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or
the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of this Agreement or the Aggregate Commitment and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 
(d) Evidence of Payments. Upon request by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.05, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the
original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by law to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be.  (e) Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation. (i) Each Lender shall deliver to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable laws or when reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable laws or
by the taxing authorities of any jurisdiction and such other reasonably requested information (A) to secure any applicable exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, deduction or withholding imposed by any jurisdiction in respect of any
payments to be made by the Borrower to such Lender, and (B) as will permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine (1) whether or not payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document are subject
to Taxes, (2) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction, and (3) such Lenders entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender by
the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lenders status for withholding tax purposes in the applicable jurisdiction. 
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower (or, if the Borrower is disregarded as an entity
separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Person treated as its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, 
(A) any Lender (or, if such Lender is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
the Person treated as its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the
date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form
W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the

  43 





Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; 
(B) each Foreign Lender (or, if such Foreign Lender is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, the Person treated as its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is entitled under the Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other
Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to
time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender (or, if such Foreign Lender is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Person treated as
its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable: 
(1) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-BEN-E, as applicable, claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, 
(2) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, 
(3) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY and all required
supporting documentation,  (4) in the case of a Foreign Lender (or, if such Foreign Lender is disregarded as an entity
separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Person treated as its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a
certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender (or such other Person) is not (A) a bank within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the
meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or 
(5) executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction
in U.S. federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable laws to permit the 
  44 





Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. 
(C) each Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower such documentation reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent or the Borrower sufficient for the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine whether payments to such Lender are subject to withholding tax under FATCA. Solely for
purposes of this sub-clause (C), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
(iii) Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which
would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Installation), to avoid any requirement of applicable laws of any jurisdiction that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent make any withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts
payable to such Lender.  (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable laws, at no time shall the Administrative
Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If the Administrative Agent or any
Lender determines, in its sole discretion, exercised in good faith that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts
pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving
rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the
relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any
penalties, interest (to the extent accrued from the date such refund is paid over to the Borrower) or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority), to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or
such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes
that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.  Section 3.06 Mitigation Obligations. If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.01 or Section 3.02, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.05,

  45 





or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.03, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Installation for funding or booking its Loans
hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
Section 3.01, 3.02 or 3.05, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.03, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and
would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
Section 3.07 Inability to Determine Rates. (a) If the Required Lenders determine that for any
reason in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (i) deposits (whether in Dollars or a Foreign Currency) are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for
the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Loan, (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Loan
(whether denominated in Dollars or a Foreign Currency), or (iii) the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of
funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans in the affected currency shall be suspended until the Administrative
Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for the making of, conversion to, or continuation of, Eurocurrency Loans of the affected currency or,
failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for Alternate Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which
determination shall be made by notice to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to Borrower) that the
Borrower or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that:  (i) (A) deposits (whether in Dollars or any Foreign
Currency) are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of any applicable Eurocurrency Loan for the applicable currency or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not exist
for ascertaining LIBOR for the applicable currency for any requested Interest Period, including, without limitation, because the Eurocurrency Base Rate is not available or published on a current basis, and in each case such circumstances are
unlikely to be temporary, or  (ii) the administrator of the Eurocurrency Base Rate for the applicable currency or a
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent 
  46 





has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR for the applicable currency or the Eurocurrency Base Rate for the applicable currency shall no longer be made available,
or used for determining the interest rate of loans (such specific date, the Scheduled Unavailability Date), or 
(iii) syndicated loans in the U.S. market denominated in the applicable currency being executed at the time, or that include
language similar to that contained in this Section 3.07, are being generally executed or amended, as applicable, to incorporate or adopt, as applicable, a new benchmark interest rate to replace LIBOR for the applicable currency, 
then, reasonably promptly after such determination by the Administrative Agent or receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, as
applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement (a LIBOR Successor Amendment) to replace the Eurocurrency Base Rate with respect to the applicable currency with an alternate benchmark rate, giving
due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities in the U.S. market denominated in the applicable currency for such alternative benchmarks (any such proposed rate, a Replacement
Rate) and any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time,
Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders do not accept such amendment. 
If no Replacement Rate has been determined and the circumstances under clause (i) above exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has
occurred (as applicable), the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected
Eurocurrency Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) the Eurocurrency Rate component shall no longer be utilized in determining the Alternate Base Rate. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of,
conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Alternate Base Rate Loans
(subject to the foregoing clause (y)) in the amount specified therein.  Section 3.08 Survival. All
of the Borrowers obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of this Agreement or the Aggregate Commitment, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and resignation of the Administrative Agent.

purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the 
  61 





Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or thereunder or waiving any Default hereunder or thereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall: 
(a) Extend the final maturity of any of the Loans of any Lender or forgive all or any portion of the principal amount thereof payable to any
Lender, or reduce the rate or extend the scheduled time of payment of interest or fees thereon (other than a waiver of the application of the default rate of interest pursuant to Section 2.11 hereof) payable to any Lender, without the consent
of each Lender affected thereby.  (b) Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders or any other percentage of
Lenders specified to be the applicable percentage in this Agreement to act on specified matters or amend Section 2.19 or the definition of Pro Rata Share, without the consent of all Lenders affected thereby. For the sake of clarity,
the addition of one or more term loan facilities or the increase or addition of one or more revolving credit facilities or an extension of the maturity of a portion of the Revolving Facility and similar modifications shall be permitted with the
consent of the Required Lenders and the Lenders agreeing to participate in the new facility or to increase the amount of their commitment or extend the maturity of their Loans. 
(c) Extend the Maturity Date or the Facility Termination Date as it applies to any Lender (other than as expressly permitted by the terms of
Section 2.02(a)), or increase the amount or otherwise extend the term of the Commitment of any Lender hereunder (other than as expressly permitted by the terms of Section 2.01(b)) without the consent of each Lender affected thereby. 
(d) Permit the Borrower to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement except as provided in Section 6.07 without the consent of
all Lenders.  (e) Amend the definition of Foreign Currency without the consent of all Lenders. 
(f) Amend this Section 8.02 without the consent of all Lenders.

the written consent of the Administrative Agent; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative
Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (iii) any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency (including, without limitation, amendments, supplements or waivers to any of documents executed by the Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement if such amendment, supplement or waiver is
delivered in order to cause such related documents to be consistent with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents) and (iv) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may enter into amendments or modifications to this Agreement or enter into
additional documentation as the Administrative Agent reasonably deems appropriate in order to implement any Replacement Rate or otherwise effectuate the terms of Section 3.07(b) in 
  62 





accordance with the terms of Section 3.07(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or
consent hereunder, (it being specifically understood and agreed that any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other
than Defaulting Lenders), except that (A) the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (B) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected
Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender. 
Section 8.03 Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent
to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or Unmatured Default or the
inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by, or by the Administrative Agent with the consent of, the requisite number of
Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.02, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders until all of the Obligations have been paid in full.  ARTICLE IX 
GENERAL PROVISIONS 
Section 9.01 Survival of Representations. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any
other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by
the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default

Section 9.03 Headings. Section headings in the Loan
Documents are for convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of the provisions of the Loan Documents. 
Section 9.04 Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents, together with the Fee Letter, embody the entire
agreement and understanding among the Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders party thereto and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders, as applicable, relating to
the subject matter thereof.  Section 9.05 Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement.
The respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the Agents are authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to perform
any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its obligations hereunder. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in Section 12.01(d) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement; provided, however, that the parties hereto expressly agree that each Arranger shall enjoy the benefits of the provisions of Sections 9.06, 9.09 and 10.07 to the extent
specifically set forth therein and shall have the right to enforce such provisions on its own behalf and in its own name to the same extent as if it were a party to this Agreement.

Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) and (ii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of a single counsel (and
to the extent reasonably determined to be necessary, one local counsel and one regulatory counsel in any applicable jurisdiction) for the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders) in connection with the enforcement or protection of its
rights (A) in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or (B) in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including all such reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans.

sub-agent thereof) and each Lender, and each Related Party of 
  64 





any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal and other related expenses (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any
Indemnitee), in each case to the extent arising out of any investigation, litigation, claim or proceeding in connection with or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative
Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including in respect of any matters addressed in Section 3.05), (ii) any
Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) to the extent relating to the foregoing, any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based
on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (x) the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnitee or its Related Parties, (y) a material breach of such Indemnitees or its Related Parties obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document or (z) a dispute among two or more Indemnitees not arising from any act
or omission of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries hereunder (but not including any such dispute that involves a Lender to the extent such Lender is acting in a different capacity (i.e., the Administrative Agent or the Arrangers) under any Loan
Document). This Section 9.06(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim. 
(c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under
subsection (a) of this Section or the Borrower for any reason fail to indefeasibly pay or cause to be paid any amount required under subsection (b) of this Section, in each case, to be paid to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party,
as the case may be, such Lenders ratable share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim,
damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of
the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of
Section 2.17(b). 
  65 




(d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, each party hereto shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any other party hereto, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising
out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof (it being agreed
that the Borrowers indemnity and contribution obligations set forth in this Section 9.06 shall apply in respect of any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages that may be awarded against any Indemnitee in connection with a
claim by a third party unaffiliated with the Indemnitee). No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such
unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for
direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or its Related Parties or a material breach of such Indemnitees or its Related Parties obligations hereunder or under any
other Loan Document, in each case, as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  (e)
Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten (10) Business Days after written demand therefor.

Section 9.07 Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all accounting terms used
herein shall be interpreted and all accounting determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles. 
Section 9.08 Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document that is held
to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the operation, enforceability, or validity
of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.08, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any
provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited. 
Section 9.09 Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower on the one hand and
the Lenders and the Agents on the other hand shall be solely that of borrower and lender. None of the Agents or any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower. None of the Agents or any Lender undertakes any responsibility to

practicable and to the extent permitted by applicable law, to seek a protective court order with respect to such Information prior to such disclosure (it being understood that the refusal by a court to grant such a protective order shall not prevent
the disclosure of such Information thereafter)), (f) subject to the acknowledgment and acceptance by any such party that such information is being disseminated on a confidential basis in accordance with the standard syndication process of the
Arrangers or customary market standards for dissemination of such types of information, subject to customary confidentiality restrictions that are no less restrictive in any material respect than those in this Section, which shall in any event

under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower, (h) in connection with

Administrative Agent and each Lender may disclose the existence of this Agreement and the information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar services providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  For purposes
of this Section, Information means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have
complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. 
Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public

Section 9.11 Nonreliance. Each of the Lenders hereby represents that it is not relying on or looking

Section 9.12 Disclosure. The Borrower and each Lender hereby acknowledge and agree that the
Administrative Agent and/or its respective Affiliates and certain of the other Lenders and/or their respective Affiliates from time to time may hold investments in, make other loans to or have other relationships with the Borrower and its
Affiliates.  ARTICLE X 
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 
Section 10.01 Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Mizuho to act
on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms
hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The 
  68 





provisions of this Article, other than Section 10.06 below, are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party
beneficiary of any of such provisions (other than as provided in Section 10.06 below). It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to
the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or
reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.  Section 10.02 Rights as a
Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term
Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its
Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were
not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.  Section 10.03
Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing
(including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person; provided that the foregoing shall not
relieve the Administrative Agent of its obligations to comply with the procedures set forth in Section 2.08, including the requirement to orally confirm the location and number of the Borrowers account to which proceeds of Loans are to be
disbursed. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with
any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not
be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
Section 10.04 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: 
(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; 
  69 




(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of
the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the
Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture,
modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and  (c) shall not, except as
expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the
Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be
necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Article VIII) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative
Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender. 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any
other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.  Section 10.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform
any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any
such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative 
  70 





Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct (or breached its material obligations under the Loan Documents) in
the selection of such sub-agents.  Section 10.06 Resignation of
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, subject to, so long
as no Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank
with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the
retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above, subject to, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Borrower (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become
effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts
then owed to the retiring Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 3.08 and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring Administrative Agent as of the
effective date of its resignation), and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section).
The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agents resignation
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.06 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. 
Section 10.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other
Lenders. Each of the Lenders acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into 
  71 





this Agreement. Each of the Lenders also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based
on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document
furnished hereunder or thereunder.  Section 10.08 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, the joint book managers, Arrangers or other Agents listed on the cover page hereof shall not have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as
applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.  Section 10.09 Administrative Agent May File
Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be
due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated), by intervention in such
proceeding or otherwise:  (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of
the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 
(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each
Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Administrative Agent. 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any
Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

ARTICLE XI

void).  (b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(i) Minimum Amounts. 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment and the Loans at the
time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
  74 




(B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the
aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment,
determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less
than $10,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default under Sections 7.02, 7.05 or 7.06 has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group)
will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met.  (ii)
Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned. 
(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection
(b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:  (A) the prior written consent of the Borrower (such consent to be provided in
the Borrowers sole discretion) shall be required unless (i) a Default under Sections 7.02, 7.05 or 7.06 has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (ii) such assignment is to a Person that is a Lender (as
defined under the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement as in effect on the Signing Date) on the Signing Date and, as a result of such assignment, the assignees Commitment is equal to or less than such assignees Commitment (as defined
under the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement as in effect on the Signing Date) under the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement as in effect on the Signing Date; and 
(B) the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be
required if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender. 
(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and

  75 





recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire. 
(v) No Assignment to Borrower. No such assignment shall be made to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries.  (vi) No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural person. 
(vii) No Assignment to Defaulting Lenders. No such assignment shall be made to a Defaulting Lender. 
(viii) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting
Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate
amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent, the Pro Rata Share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment
liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full Pro Rata Share of all Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be
a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.03, 3.04, 3.05, and 9.06 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to
the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a

  76 





sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section. 
(c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent
of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal
amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In addition, the
Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower at any reasonable time and
from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In addition, at any time that a request for a consent for a material or substantive change to the Loan Documents is pending, any Lender may request and receive from the Administrative Agent a copy of
the Register.  (d) Participations. Any Lender may, with the prior written consent of the Borrower ((i) such consent to be provided
in the Borrowers sole discretion, (ii) such consent not to be required if a Default under Sections 7.02, 7.05 or 7.06 has occurred and is continuing at the time of the sale of the applicable participation and (iii) such consent
not to be required for a participation to a Person that is a Lender (as defined under the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement as in effect on the Signing Date) on the Signing Date), sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person,
Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant), in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and/or the Loans); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right
to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 8.02 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.03, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also

  77 





shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.01 as though it were a Lender, provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.19 as though it were a Lender.
 Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a nonfiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register
on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other Obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register);
provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans or
its other Obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other Obligation is in registered form under
Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent)
shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall
not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01, 3.03, 3.04 or 3.05 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the
participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.05 unless such Participant agrees to comply with Section 3.05 as though it were a
Lender (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.05(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation). 
(f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central banking authority having jurisdiction over such Lender;
provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
Section 12.02 Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each of the Lenders to
disclose to any Participant or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a Transferee) and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lenders possession concerning
the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including without limitation any information contained in any reports or other information delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01; provided that each Transferee and
prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.10 of this Agreement or other provisions at least as restrictive as Section 9.10 including making the acknowledgments set forth therein. 
  78 




Section 12.03 Tax Treatment. If any interest in any
Loan Document is transferred to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 3.05(e); provided, that damages for any breach of this Section 12.03 shall in no event exceed the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Borrower in collecting or attempting to collect from the Transferee any forms it reasonably requires in order to determine its
withholding and reporting obligations in accordance with Section 3.05(e) herein.  ARTICLE XIII 
NOTICES 
Section 13.01 Notices; Effectiveness; Electronic Communication. (a) Notices
Generally. Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone (and except as provided in subsection (b) below), all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing
and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by telecopier as follows, and all notices and other communications expressly permitted hereunder to be given by telephone shall be made to
the applicable telephone number, as follows:  (i) if to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to the address,
telecopier number, electronic mail address or telephone number set forth on Schedule 13.01; and  (ii) if to any other
Lender, to the address, telecopier number, electronic mail address or telephone number specified in its administrative questionnaire.  Notices and other
communications sent by hand or overnight courier service, or mailed by certified or registered mail, shall be deemed to have been given when received; notices and other communications sent by telecopier shall be deemed to have been given when sent
(except that, if not given during normal business hours for the recipient, shall be deemed to have been given at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient). Notices and other communications delivered through electronic
communications to the extent provided in paragraph (b) below, shall be effective as provided in said paragraph (b).  (b)
Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and internet or intranet websites)
pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent or as otherwise determined by the Administrative Agent, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Article II if such Lender has notified the
Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its respective discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it
hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it or as it otherwise determines, provided that such determination or approval may be limited to particular notices or communications. 
  79 




Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other
communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the senders receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the return receipt requested function,
as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), provided that if such notice or other communication is not given during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or
communication shall be deemed to have been given at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed
receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address

(AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT
PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender, or any
other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agents transmission of Borrower Materials through the Internet,
except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent
Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender, or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual
damages).  (d) Change of Address, Etc. Each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may change its address, telecopier or
telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by written notice to the other parties hereto. Each other Lender may change its address, telecopier or telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by written notice
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. In addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record (i) an effective address, contact name, telephone number,
telecopier number and electronic mail address to which notices and other communications may be sent and (ii) accurate wire instructions for such Lender. Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of
such Public Lender to at all times have selected the Private Side Information or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public
Lenders compliance procedures and applicable law, including United States Federal and state securities laws, to make 
  80 





reference to Borrower Materials that are not made available through the Public Side Information portion of the Platform and that may contain material
non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws. 
(e) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any
notices purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower so long as such notices appear on their face to be authentic even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any
other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Related Parties of each of them
from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the
Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.  ARTICLE XIV 
COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS; ELECTRONIC EXECUTION 
Section 14.01 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by
different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Except as provided in Article IV, this Agreement shall become effective when it
shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or email shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart
of this Agreement.  Section 14.02 Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words
execute, execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in or related to any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without
limitation Assignment and Assumptions, amendments or other modifications, Borrowing Notices, waivers and consents) shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, the electronic matching of assignment terms and contract formations on electronic
platforms approved by the Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping
system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar
state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; provided that notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to agree to

  81 





accept electronic signatures in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it. 
ARTICLE XV  CHOICE OF LAW;
CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL  Section 15.01 Choice of Law. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES THEREUNDER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CLAIMS SOUNDING IN CONTRACT LAW OR TORT LAW ARISING OUT OF THE SUBJECT MATTER THEREOF AND ANY DETERMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO POST-JUDGMENT INTEREST) SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. 
Section 15.02 Consent to Jurisdiction. EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE AGENTS AND THE LENDERS HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO JURISDICTION OF ANY FEDERAL COURT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN OR, IF THAT COURT DOES NOT HAVE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION, IN ANY STATE COURT LOCATED IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF NEW YORK
IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OU

HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE AGENTS OR LENDERS TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW. 
Section 15.03 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION.  Section 15.04 U.S. Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender that is subject to the U.S. Patriot
Act and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the
Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the U.S. Patriot Act. The Borrower
shall, promptly following a request by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all documentation and other information that the Administrative Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable
know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S. Patriot Act. 
Section 15.05 No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all aspects of each
transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates understanding, that:
(i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders are arms-length commercial transactions between the Borrower and
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders, on the other hand, (B) the Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and
(C) the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) each of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and
the Lenders is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or
any other Person and (B) neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arrangers nor any of the Lenders has any obligation to the Borrower or any of its 
  83 





Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent, the
Arrangers, the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arrangers nor any
of the Lenders has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or its Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Borrower hereby agrees and covenants that it will not make any claims that it may have against the
Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby. 
Section 15.06 Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to
convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency
with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the Judgment Currency) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the Agreement Currency), be discharged
only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may
in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the
Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement
Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to
any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).  Section 15.07 Acknowledgement and
Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party
hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and
consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:  (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution
Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; 
  84 




(b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such
liability, including, if applicable:  (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; 
(ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its
parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document; or  (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the
Write-Down and Conversion Powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.  [Signature Pages Follow]

 For purposes of the foregoing, Index Debt means senior, unsecured, long-term Indebtedness for Borrowed
Money of the Borrower that is not guaranteed by any other person or subject to any other credit enhancement. If (i) either Moodys or S&P shall not have in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of the circumstances
referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph), then such rating agency shall be deemed to have established a rating in Rating Category 5; (ii) the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moodys and S&P for the Index
Debt shall fall within different Rating Categories, the Applicable Margin shall be based on the higher of the two ratings, and (iii) the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moodys and S&P for the Index Debt shall
be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of Moodys or S&P), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating agency. Each change in the Applicable Margin shall
apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If the rating system of Moodys or S&P shall change, or if either such rating
agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such
rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Margin shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.
