CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of January 2, 2014 (this Agreement), among
SALIX PHARMACEUTICALS, LTD., a Delaware corporation (the Borrower), the Lenders (such term and each other capitalized term used but not defined in this introductory statement having the meaning given it in Article I), PNC
BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as Issuing Bank, PNC BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as Swingline Lender, and JEFFERIES FINANCE LLC, as administrative agent (in such capacity, including any successor thereto, the Administrative Agent) and
as collateral agent (in such capacity, including any successor thereto, the Collateral Agent) for the Lenders.  The
Borrower has requested the Lenders to extend credit in the form of (a) Term Loans to the Borrower on the Closing Date, in an aggregate principal amount of $1,200,000,000, and (b) Revolving Loans at any time after the Closing Date and from
time to time prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not in excess of $150,000,000. The Borrower has requested the Swingline Lender to extend credit, at any time and from time to time
prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, in the form of Swingline Loans, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not in excess of $10,000,000. The Borrower has requested the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit, in an
aggregate face amount at any time outstanding not in excess of $25,000,000, to support payment obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business by the Borrower and the Wholly Owned Subsidiaries. The proceeds of the Term Loans are to be used
on the Closing Date, together with at least $820,000,000 of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet of the Borrower (the Existing Acquiror Cash) and the proceeds of the Senior Unsecured Notes, to finance the Acquisition, to
refinance the Existing Target Debt and to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions. The proceeds of the Revolving Loans and the Swingline Loans are to be used after the Closing Date solely for working capital and general
corporate purposes of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries (including for a Specified Transaction and other investments and acquisitions permitted by this Agreement). 
The Lenders are willing to extend such credit to the Borrower, and the Issuing Banks are willing to issue Letters of Credit for the account of
the Borrower, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
ARTICLE I 
DEFINITIONS 
SECTION 1.01. Defined Terms. As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings specified below: 
ABR, when used in reference to any Loan or Borrowing, shall mean that such Loan, or the Loans comprising such Borrowing,
bears or bear interest at a rate determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate.  Acquired Entity shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.04(k).  Acquisition shall mean, collectively, the Tender Offer
and the Merger. 


Additional Unsecured Debt shall mean Indebtedness incurred pursuant to, and in
accordance with, Section 6.01(j).  Additional Unsecured Debt Documents shall mean each indenture, purchase
agreement, loan agreement, guaranty, note or other agreement, document or instrument entered into in connection with any Additional Unsecured Debt. 
Adjusted LIBO Rate shall mean, with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing for any Interest Period, an interest rate per annum
equal to the greater of (a) 1.00% per annum and (b) the product of (i) the LIBO Rate in effect for such Interest Period and (ii) Statutory Reserves. 
Administrative Agent shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the introductory statement to this Agreement. 
Administrative Questionnaire shall mean an Administrative Questionnaire in the form of Exhibit A, or such other form
as may be supplied from time to time by the Administrative Agent.  Advisors shall mean legal counsel (including local
and foreign counsel), auditors, accountants, consultants, appraisers, engineers or other advisors.  Affiliate shall
mean, when used with respect to a specified Person, another Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls or is Controlled by or is under common Control with the Person specified; provided, however,
that, for purposes of the definition of Eligible Assignee and Section 6.07, the term Affiliate shall also include any Person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of any class of Equity Interests of the
Person specified or that is an officer or director of the Person specified. No Agent or Joint Lead Arranger or any Affiliate thereof shall be deemed to be an Affiliate of any Loan Parties for purposes of this Agreement. 
Affiliate Subordination Agreement shall mean an Affiliate Subordination Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit
G, pursuant to which intercompany obligations and advances owed by any Loan Party are subordinated to the Obligations.  Agent
Fees shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 2.05(b).  Agents shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Article VIII.  Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure shall mean the aggregate
amount of the Lenders Revolving Credit Exposures.  Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the
introductory statement hereto.  Agreement Value shall mean, in respect of any one or more Hedging Agreements, after
taking into account the effect of any legally enforceable netting agreement relating to any such Hedging Agreement, (i) for any date on or after the date such Hedging Agreement has been closed out and termination value(s) determined in
accordance therewith, such termination 
  2 



value(s) and (ii) for any date prior to the date referenced in clause (i), the amount(s) determined as the mark-to-market value(s) for such Hedging Agreement, as determined based upon one or
more mid-market or other readily available quotations provided by any recognized dealer in such Hedging Agreement (which may include a Lender or any Affiliate of a Lender). 
Alternate Base Rate shall mean, for any day, a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the Base Rate in effect on
such day, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%, (c) one-month Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 1.00% per annum and (d) 2.00%; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Adjusted LIBO Rate
for any day shall be based on the rate determined on such day at approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) by reference to the British Bankers Association Interest Settlement Rates for deposits in Dollars (as set forth by any service selected by
the Administrative Agent that has been nominated by the British Bankers Association as an authorized vendor for the purpose of displaying such rates). If the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive
absent manifest error) that it is unable to ascertain the Federal Funds Effective Rate for any reason, including the inability or failure of the Administrative Agent to obtain sufficient quotations in accordance with the terms of the definition
thereof, the Alternate Base Rate shall be determined without regard to clause (b) of the preceding sentence until the circumstances giving rise to such inability no longer exist. Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Base
Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or the Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be effective from and including the effective date of such change in the Base Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or the Adjusted LIBO Rate, as the case may be. 
Anti-Terrorism Laws shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 3.24(a). 
Applicable Margin shall mean, for any day, (a) with respect to Revolving Loans, (i) 2.00%, in the case of ABR
Loans, and (ii) 3.00%, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, (b) with respect to Term Loans (other than Incremental Term Loans in the form of Other Term Loans), initially (i) 2.25%, in the case of ABR Loans, and (ii) 3.25%, in the
case of Eurod

rcentage determined in accordance with Section 2.24 and as set forth in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement. From and after each day of
delivery of any certificate delivered in accordance with the first sentence of the following paragraph (each, a Start Date) to and including the applicable End Date described below, the Applicable Margins for Term Loans (other
than Incremental term Loans in the form of Other Term Loans) shall be those set forth below opposite the Total Leverage Ratio indicated to have been achieved in any certificate delivered in accordance with the following sentence:

The Total Leverage Ratio used in a determination of the Applicable Margins for such Term Loans
shall be determined based on the delivery of a certificate of the Borrower (each, a Quarterly Pricing Certificate) by a Financial Officer of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent (for distribution to each Lender), within 45
days after the last day of each fiscal quarter (or within 90 days after the last day of the fourth fiscal quarter). The Quarterly Pricing Certificate shall set forth the calculation of the Total Leverage Ratio as at the last day of the period of
four consecutive fiscal quarters of the Borrower ended immediately prior to the relevant Start Date and the Applicable Margins that shall be thereafter applicable (until such Applicable Margins are changed in accordance with the following
sentences). The Applicable Margins so determined shall apply, except to the extent set forth in the succeeding sentence, from the relevant Start Date to the earlier of (x) the date on which the next Quarterly Pricing Certificate is delivered to
the Administrative Agent and (y) the date which is 45 days (or 90 days in the case of the fourth fiscal quarter) following the last day of the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of the Borrower in which the previous Start Date occurred
(such earlier date, the End Date), at which time, if no Quarterly Pricing Certificate has been delivered to the Administrative Agent indicating an entitlement to new Applicable Margins (and thus commencing a new Start Date), the
Applicable Margins for such Term Loans shall be those set forth in the table above corresponding to a Total Leverage Ratio of greater than or equal to 3.75:1.00 (such Applicable Margins as so determined, the Highest Applicable
Margins). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above in this definition, (A) the Applicable Margins for the respective Term Loans shall be the Highest Applicable Margins (x) at all times during which there shall
exist any Default or Event of Default and (y) at all times prior to the date of delivery of the financial statements and related Quarterly Pricing Certificate pursuant to Section 5.04(b) for the fiscal quarter ending June 30,
2014, and (B) the Applicable Margins for such Term Loans shall be increased as, and to the extent, necessary to comply with Section 2.24(b). 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above in this definition or elsewhere in this Agreement, if it is subsequently determined
that the Total Leverage Ratio set forth in any Quarterly Pricing Certificate delivered for any period is inaccurate for any reason and the result thereof is that the respective Lenders received interest for any period based on an Applicable Margin
that is less than that which would have been applicable had the Total Leverage Ratio been accurately determined, then, for all purposes of this Agreement, the Applicable Margin for any day occurring within the period covered by such
Quarterly Pricing Certificate shall retroactively be deemed to be the relevant percentage as based upon the accurately determined Total Leverage Ratio for such period, and any shortfall in the interest theretofore paid by the Borrower for the
relevant period as a result of the miscalculation of the Total Leverage Ratio shall be due and payable within five Business Days after the Borrower obtains knowledge (including by way of notification thereof from the Administrative Agent or the
Required Lenders) that the Total Leverage Ratio was inaccurately computed; provided, however, if an Event of Default under Section 7.01(g) or (h) then exists, such interest shall be deemed to have been due and
payable under the relevant provisions at the time the interest for such period was required to have been paid pursuant to said provisions on the same basis as if the Total Leverage Ratio had been accurately set forth in such Quarterly Pricing
Certificate (together with all amounts owing as default interest). Upon the payment in full of any accrued additional interest pursuant to this paragraph, any Default or Event of Default that may have arisen solely as a result

  4 



of the Quarterly Pricing Certificate miscalculating the Total Leverage Ratio for purposes of calculating the Applicable Margins (but not for purposes of calculating the Total Leverage Ratio under
Section 6.11 or any other Section of this Agreement or as a result of any other inaccuracy or misrepresentation set forth in such Quarterly Pricing Certificate) shall be deemed cured. 
Asset Sale shall mean the sale, transfer or other disposition (by way of merger, casualty, condemnation or otherwise) by
the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries to any Person other than the Borrower or any Subsidiary of (a) any Equity Interests of any of the Subsidiaries (other than (i) directors qualifying shares and (ii) in the case of a Foreign
Subsidiary, nominal amounts of shares required by applicable law to be held by local nationals) or (b) any other assets of the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the following items
will be deemed to be an Asset Sale:  (i) the sale, transfer or other disposition of inventory, damaged, obsolete or worn out assets,
equipment no longer used or useful in the business of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, Permitted Investments and other assets, in each case sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business; 
(ii) the sale or discount without recourse of accounts receivable in connection with the compromise thereof or the assignment of past due
accounts receivable for collection and not in connection with any financing arrangement;  (iii) leases of properties in the ordinary
course of business;  (iv) to the extent allowable under Section 1031 of the Code, any exchange of like property (excluding any boot
thereon) for use in a Permitted Business;  (v) any surrender or waiver of contract rights or the settlement, release or surrender of
contract rights or other litigation claims in the ordinary course of business;  (vi) the unwinding of any Hedging Agreements or the
settlement or early termination of the Existing Convertible Notes Hedges;  (vii) the abandonment of any Intellectual Property rights of
the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, which in the reasonable good faith determination of the Borrower are not material to the conduct of the business of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole; 
(viii) any disposition in connection with a co-development agreement in a manner consistent with customary practice for a pharmaceutical
company;  (ix) the licensing or sublicensing of Intellectual Property or other general intangibles in a manner consistent with customary
practice for a pharmaceutical company;  (x) the creation of a Permitted Lien (but not the sale or other disposition of property subject to
the Permitted Lien); and  (xi) any sale, transfer or other disposition or series of related sales, transfers or other dispositions having
a value not in excess of $10,000,000. 
  5 


Assignment and Acceptance shall mean an assignment and acceptance entered into
by a Lender and an Eligible Assignee, and accepted by the Administrative Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit B, or such other form as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent. 
Auction Manager shall mean Jefferies Finance LLC or an Affiliate of Jefferies Finance LLC designated by Jefferies Finance
LLC (or, if Jefferies Finance LLC declines to act as Auction Manager, an investment bank of recognized standing selected by the Borrower), which shall be engaged to act in such capacity on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to Jefferies
Finance LLC (or such other investment bank).  Auction Notice shall mean an auction notice given by the Borrower in
accordance with the Auction Procedures with respect to a Discounted Prepayment Offer.  Auction Procedures shall mean

ARTICLE II 
THE CREDITS 
SECTION 2.01. Commitments. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the representations and warranties herein
set forth, (i) each Term Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, to make a Term Loan to the Borrower on the Closing Date in a principal amount equal to its Term Loan Commitment and (ii) each Revolving Credit Lender agrees, severally and
not jointly, to make Revolving Loans to the Borrower from time to time after the Closing Date, and until the earlier of the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender in accordance with the
terms hereof, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in such Lenders Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding such Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment; provided that after giving effect to any
Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment. Within the limits set forth in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence and subject to the terms, conditions
and limitations set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, pay or prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans. Amounts paid or prepaid in respect of Term Loans may not be reborrowed. 
(b) Each Lender having an Incremental Term Loan Commitment, severally and not jointly, hereby agrees, subject to the terms and conditions and
relying upon the representations and warranties set forth herein and in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement, to make Incremental Term Loans to the Borrower, in an aggregate principal amount equal to its Incremental Term Loan Commitment.
Amounts paid or prepaid in respect of Incremental Term Loans may not be reborrowed.  SECTION 2.02. Loans. (a) Each Loan
(other than Swingline Loans) shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their applicable Commitments. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender). Except for Loans deemed made pursuant to
Section 2.02(f) and Mandatory Borrowings, the Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is (i) (x) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than
$2,000,000, and (y) in the case of ABR Loans, an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $1,000,000 (except, with respect to any Incremental Term Borrowing, to the extent otherwise provided in Section 2.24(a) or the related
Incremental Assumption Agreement) or (ii) equal to the remaining available balance of the applicable Commitments.  (b) Subject to
Sections 2.02(f), 2.08 and 2.15, each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.03. Each Lender may at its option make any Eurodollar
Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing that, if made, would result in more than ten Eurodollar Borrowings in the

  45 



aggregate outstanding hereunder at any time (or such greater number of Eurodollar Borrowings as may be acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion). For purposes of the
foregoing, Borrowings having different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Borrowings. 
(c) Except with respect to Loans made pursuant to Section 2.02(f), each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on
the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account in New York City as the Administrative Agent may designate not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly credit the
amounts so received to an account designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts so received
to the respective Lenders.  (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any
Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders portion of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date
of such Borrowing in accordance with paragraph (c) above and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent shall have so made
funds available then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum
equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds (which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error). If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute such Lenders Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement.  (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Revolving Credit
Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.  (f) If the Issuing
Bank shall not have received from the Borrower the payment required to be made by Section 2.23(e) within the time specified in such Section, such Issuing Bank will promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the L/C Disbursement and the
Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender of such L/C Disbursement and its Pro Rata Percentage thereof. Each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent
not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on such date (or, if such Revolving Credit Lender shall have received such notice later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, on any day, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
immediately following Business Day), an amount equal to such Lenders Pro Rata Percentage of such L/C Disbursement (it being understood that (i) if the conditions precedent to borrowing set forth in Sections 4.01(b) and
(c) have been satisfied, such 
  46 



amount shall be deemed to constitute an ABR Revolving Loan of such Lender and, to the extent of such payment, the obligations of the Borrower in respect of such L/C Disbursement shall be
discharged and replaced with the resulting ABR Revolving Credit Borrowing and (ii) if such conditions precedent to borrowing have not been satisfied, then any such amount paid by any Revolving Credit Lender shall not constitute a Loan (except
for purposes of Section 6.11) and shall not relieve the Borrower from its obligation to reimburse such L/C Disbursement), and the Administrative Agent will promptly pay to such Issuing Bank amounts so received by it from the Revolving
Credit Lenders. The Administrative Agent will promptly pay to such Issuing Bank any amounts received by it from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.23(e) prior to the time that any Revolving Credit Lender makes any payment pursuant to
this paragraph (f), and any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower thereafter will be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Credit Lenders that shall have made such payments and to such Issuing
Bank, as their interests may appear. If any Revolving Credit Lender shall not have made its Pro Rata Percentage of such L/C Disbursement available to the Administrative Agent as provided above, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay
interest on such amount, for each day from and including the date such amount is required to be paid in accordance with this paragraph (f) to but excluding the date such amount is paid, to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Issuing Bank at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.06(a), and (ii) in the case of such Lender, for the first such day, the Federal
Funds Effective Rate, and for each day thereafter, the Alternate Base Rate.  SECTION 2.03. Borrowing Procedure. In order to
request a Borrowing (other than a Swingline Loan, a deemed Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.02(f) or a Mandatory Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.22(e), in each case, as to which this Section 2.03 shall not apply),
the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 12:00 (noon). New York City time, three Business Days before a proposed Borrowing, and (b) in the
case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, one Business Day before a proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable, and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or fax to the
Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request and shall specify the following information: (i) whether the Borrowing then being requested is to be a Term Borrowing, an Incremental Term Borrowing or a Revolving Credit Borrowing, and
whether such Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing (provided that, until the Administrative Agent shall have notified the Borrower that the primary syndication of the Commitments has been completed (which notice shall
be given as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within 90 days after the Closing Date), the Borrower shall not be permitted to request a Eurodollar Borrowing with an Interest Period in excess of one month); (ii) the date of such
Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the number and location of the account to which funds are to be disbursed; (iv) the amount of such Borrowing; and (v) if such Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest
Period with respect thereto; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any contrary specification in any Borrowing Request, each requested Borrowing shall comply with the requirements set forth in Section 2.02. If no election as to
the Type of Borrowing is specified in any such Borrowing Request, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing is specified in any such Borrowing Request, then the Borrower
shall be deemed to have selected an Interest 
  47 



Period of one months duration. The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the applicable Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.03 (and the contents
thereof), and of each Lenders portion of the requested Borrowing.  SECTION 2.04. Evidence of Debt; Repayment of Loans.
(a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender (A) the principal amount of each Term Loan of such Lender as provided in Section 2.11 and (B) the
then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Revolving Credit Maturity
Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a Revolving Credit Borrowing is
made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans owing by the Borrower that were outstanding on the date of such Borrowing was requested. 
(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement. 
(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made (or deemed made) to the
Borrower hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and, if applicable, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and
(iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor and each Lenders share thereof. 
(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) above shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligations of the
Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such entries,
the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  (e) Any Lender may request that
Loans made by it hereunder be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender and its registered assigns and in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event any Lender shall request and receive such a promissory note, the interests represented by such note shall at all times (including after
any assignment of all or part of such interests pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes payable to the payee named therein or its registered assigns.

therewith in accordance with Section 2.22(e).  (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own
account, the fees payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such set forth in the Fee Letters at the times and in the amounts specified therein (the Agent Fees).

provided herein, a fee (an L/C Participation Fee) calculated on such Lenders Pro Rata Percentage of the daily aggregate L/C Exposure (excluding the portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed L/C Disbursements) during the
preceding quarter (or shorter period commencing with the date hereof or ending with the Revolving Credit Maturity Date or the date on which all Letters of Credit have been canceled or have expired and the Revolving Credit Commitments of all Lenders

with Term Loans that are prepaid, repaid, converted or subject to a pricing reduction, as applicable, in connection with such Repricing Event (including each Lender that refuses to consent to an amendment, waiver or other modification with respect
to a Repricing Event and is replaced as a Lender under Section 2.21), a fee in an amount equal to 1.00% of (x) in the case of a Repricing Event described in clause (i) of the definition thereof, the aggregate principal amount
of all Term Loans prepaid, repaid or converted in connection with such Repricing Event and (y) in the case of a Repricing Event described in clause (ii) of the definition thereof, the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans

for distribution, if and as appropriate, among the Lenders entitled thereto, except that the Issuing Bank Fees shall be paid directly to the applicable Issuing Bank. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances, absent

Applicable Margin in effect from time to time.  (c) Interest on each Loan shall be payable by the Borrower on the Interest Payment Dates
applicable to such Loan except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
SECTION 2.07. Default Interest. If any Event of Default under Section 7.01(b), (c), (d) (solely with respect to
Section 6.11), (g) or (h) has occurred and is continuing or, upon written notice from the Required Lenders to the Borrower, any other Event of Default has 
  50 



occurred and is continuing, the amount of any principal on any Loan or any other amount due hereunder or under any other Loan Document, by acceleration or otherwise, shall bear interest (after as
well as before judgment), payable on demand, at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days at all times) equal to the rate that would be applicable to an ABR Loan of the applicable Class (and
in respect of any unpaid Fee, an ABR Loan in respect of a Revolving Loan) plus 2.00% per annum.  SECTION 2.08.
Alternate Rate of Interest. In the event, and on each occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall have determined that Dollar deposits
in the principal amounts of the Loans comprising such Borrowing are not generally available in the London interbank market, or that the rates at which such Dollar deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the
majority of Lenders of making or maintaining Eurodollar Loans during such Interest Period, or that reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, give written
or fax notice of such determination to the Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any such determination, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer
exist (and the Administrative Agent agrees promptly to give notice when the Administrative Agent determines that such circumstances no longer exist), any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.03 or
2.10 shall be deemed to be a request for an ABR Borrowing. Each determination by the Administrative Agent under this Section 2.08 shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
SECTION 2.09. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) The Term Loan Commitments (other than any Incremental Term Loan
Commitments, which shall terminate as provided in the related Incremental Assumption Agreement) shall automatically terminate upon the making of the Term Loans on the Closing Date. The Revolving Credit Commitments and the Swingline Commitment shall
automatically terminate on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. The L/C Commitment shall automatically terminate on the earlier to occur of (i) the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments and (ii) the date five Business Days prior
to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.  (b) Upon at least three Business Days prior written or fax notice to the Administrative
Agent, the Borrower may at any time in whole permanently terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce, the Term Loan Commitments, the Revolving Credit Commitments or the Swingline Commitment; provided, however, that (i) each
partial reduction of the Term Loan Commitments or the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and in a minimum amount of $5,000,000, in the case of the Term Loan Commitments, and in a minimum amount of $2,000,000,
in the case of the Revolving Credit Commitments, (ii) each partial reduction of the Swingline Commitment shall be in an integral multiple of $500,000 and in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 and (iii) the Total Revolving Credit Commitment shall not be
reduced to an amount that is less than the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure at the time. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.09(b) shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination or reduction
of the Revolving Credit Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the receipt of proceeds from the 
  51 



issuance of other Indebtedness or Equity Interests or the consummation of a Change in Control, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on
or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  (c) Each reduction in the Term Loan Commitments or the
Revolving Credit Commitments hereunder shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective applicable Commitments. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders, on the date of
each termination or reduction, the Commitment Fees on the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments so terminated or reduced accrued to but excluding the date of such termination or reduction. 
SECTION 2.10. Conversion and Continuation of Borrowings. The Borrower shall have the right at any time upon prior irrevocable
written notice to the Administrative Agent (a) not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, one Business Day prior to conversion, to convert any Eurodollar Borrowing into an ABR Borrowing, (b) not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City
time, three Business Days prior to conversion or continuation, to convert any ABR Borrowing into a Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue any Eurodollar Borrowing as a Eurodollar Borrowing for an additional Interest Period and (c) not later than
12:00 (noon), New York City time, three Business Days prior to conversion, to convert the Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing to another permissible Interest Period, subject in each case to the following: 
(i) until the Administrative Agent shall have notified the Borrower that the primary syndication of the Commitments has been
completed (which notice shall be given as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within 90 days after the Closing Date), no ABR Borrowing may be converted into a Eurodollar Borrowing with an Interest Period in excess of one month; 
(ii) each conversion or continuation shall be made pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal
amounts of the Loans comprising the converted or continued Borrowing;  (iii) if less than all the outstanding principal
amount of any Borrowing shall be converted or continued, then each resulting Borrowing shall satisfy the limitations specified in Sections 2.02(a) and 2.02(b) regarding the principal amount and maximum number of Borrowings of the
relevant Type;  (iv) each conversion shall be effected by each Lender and the Administrative Agent by recording for the
account of such Lender the new Loan of such Lender resulting from such conversion and reducing the Loan (or portion thereof) of such Lender being converted by an equivalent principal amount; accrued interest on any Eurodollar Loan (or portion
thereof) being converted shall be paid by the Borrower at the time of conversion;  (v) if any Eurodollar Borrowing is
converted at a time other than the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall pay, upon demand, any amounts due to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.16; 
  52 


(vi) any portion of a Borrowing maturing or required to be repaid in less than
one month may not be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing;  (vii) any portion of a Eurodollar Borrowing
that cannot be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing by reason of the immediately preceding clause shall be automatically converted at the end of the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing into an ABR Borrowing; 
(viii) no Interest Period may be selected for any Eurodollar Term Borrowing that would end later than a Term Loan Repayment
Date occurring on or after the first day of such Interest Period if, after giving effect to such selection, the aggregate outstanding amount of (A) the Eurodollar Term Borrowings comprised of Term Loans or Other Term Loans, as applicable, with
Interest Periods ending on or prior to such Term Loan Repayment Date and (B) the ABR Term Borrowings comprised of Term Loans or Other Term Loans, as applicable, would not be at least equal to the principal amount of Term Borrowings to be paid
on such Term Loan Repayment Date; and  (ix) upon notice to the Borrower from the Administrative Agent given at the request
of the Required Lenders, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, no outstanding Loan may be converted into, or continued as, a Eurodollar Loan. 
Each notice pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be in writing and irrevocable and shall refer to this Agreement and specify
(i) the identity and amount of the Borrowing that the Borrower requests be converted or continued, (ii) whether such Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing, (iii) if such notice
requests a conversion, the date of such conversion (which shall be a Business Day) and (iv) if such Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto. If no Interest Period is
specified in any such notice with respect to any conversion to or continuation as a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration. The Administrative Agent shall advise the
Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.10 and of each Lenders portion of any converted or continued Borrowing. If the Borrower shall not have given notice in accordance with this Section 2.10 to continue
any Borrowing into a subsequent Interest Period (and shall not otherwise have given notice in accordance with this Section 2.10 to convert such Borrowing), such Borrowing shall, at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto
(unless repaid pursuant to the terms hereof), automatically be converted into an ABR Borrowing.  SECTION 2.11. Repayment of Term
Borrowings.  (a) (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, on the last Business Day of
each March, June, September and December prior to the Term Loan Maturity Date beginning on March 31, 2014, or if any such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day (each such date being called a Repayment
Date), equal quarterly installments of principal equal to 1.25% of the original principal amount 
  53 



of the Term Loans other than Other Term Loans (as adjusted from time to time pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.13(g), 2.24(d) and 2.25(c)), together in each case with
accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be paid to but excluding the date of such payment.  (ii) The
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Incremental Term Lenders, on each Incremental Term Loan Repayment Date, a principal amount of the Other Term Loans (as adjusted from time to time pursuant to
Sections 2.12, 2.13(g) and 2.25(c)) equal to the amount set forth for such date in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement, together in each case with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be paid to but
excluding the date of such payment.  (b) To the extent not previously paid, all Term Loans and Other Term Loans shall be due and payable
on the Maturity Date applicable to such Term Loans and Other Term Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be paid to but excluding the date of payment. 
SECTION 2.12. Voluntary Prepayment. (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any
Borrowing, in whole or in part, upon at least three Business Days prior written or fax notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written or fax notice) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, or written or fax notice (or telephone notice
promptly confirmed by written or fax notice) at least one Business Day prior to the date of prepayment in the case of ABR Loans, to the Administrative Agent before 12:00 (noon), New York City time; provided, however, that (i) each
partial prepayment shall be in an amount that is (x) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $1,000,000, and (y) in the case of ABR Loans, an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than
$1,000,000 and (ii) at the Borrowers election in connection with any prepayment of Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.12(a), such prepayment shall not, so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists, be applied
to any Revolving Loan of a Defaulting Lender.  (b) Voluntary prepayments of Term Loans shall be allocated pro rata between the Term Loans
and Other Term Loan, if any (based on their respective outstanding principal amounts) and shall be applied against the scheduled installments of principal due in respect of the Term Loans and Other Term Loans under Sections 2.11(a)(i) and
(ii), respectively, following the date of such prepayment as directed by the Borrower in the notice described in clause (a) above or, in the absence of any such direction, in direct order of maturity. 
(c) Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing (or portion thereof) to be
prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such Borrowing by the amount stated therein on the date stated therein; provided, however, that if such prepayment is for all of the then outstanding Loans, then the
Borrower may revoke such notice and/or extend the prepayment date by not more than five Business Days. All prepayments under this Section 2.12 shall be subject to Sections 2.05(e) (to the extent applicable) and 2.16, but
otherwise may be made without premium or penalty. All prepayments under this Section 2.12 (other than prepayments of ABR Revolving Loans that are not made in connection with the termination or permanent reduction of the Revolving Credit
Commitments) shall be accompanied by accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be prepaid to but excluding the date of payment. 
  54 


SECTION 2.13. Mandatory Prepayments. (a) In the event of any termination of all
the Revolving Credit Commitments, the Borrower shall, on the date of such termination, repay or prepay all outstanding Revolving Credit Borrowings and all outstanding Swingline Loans and replace or cause to be canceled (or make other arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank with respect to) all outstanding Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank. If, after giving effect to any partial reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments or at any
other time, the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, then the Borrower shall, on the date of such reduction or at such other time, repay or prepay Revolving Credit Borrowings or Swingline Loans (or
a combination thereof) and if, after the Revolving Credit Borrowings and Swingline Loans shall have been repaid or prepaid in full, the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure continues to exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, then the Borrower
shall cash collateralize or provide a backstop letter of credit with respect to such excess in accordance with Section 2.13(f). 
(b) Not later than the third Business Day following the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds in respect of any Asset Sale, other than Asset Sales
permitted by clause (iii) of Section 6.05(b), the Borrower shall apply 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received with respect thereto to prepay outstanding Term Loans in accordance with Section 2.13(g). 
(c) Not later than the third Business Day following the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds in respect of any casualty or other insured damage to,
or any taking under power of eminent domain or by condemnation or similar proceeding of, any property or asset of the Borrower or any Subsidiary with a fair market value immediately prior to such event equal to or greater than $5,000,000, the
Borrower shall apply 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received with respect thereto to prepay outstanding Term Loans in accordance with Section 2.13(g). 
(d) No later than 95 days after the end of each fiscal year, commencing with the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2014, the Borrower
shall prepay outstanding Term Loans in accordance with Section 2.13(g) in an aggregate principal amount equal to (x) 50% of Excess Cash Flow for the fiscal year then ended minus (y) the aggregate principal amount of
Loans (other than any Term Loans (calculated at the face amount thereof) purchased or prepaid pursuant to a Discounted Prepayment Offer pursuant to Section 2.25) to the extent (and only to the extent) voluntarily prepaid pursuant to
Section 2.12 with internally generated funds (but in a case of a voluntary prepayment of Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans, only to the extent accompanied by a voluntary reduction to the Total Revolving Credit Commitment in an amount
equal to such prepayment) during the same fiscal year; provided that the percentage set forth in clause (x) above shall be (A) 25%, if the Borrower achieves a Total Leverage Ratio of less than 3.50:1.00 but greater than or equal to
2.50:1.00 as of the last day of such fiscal year and (B) 0%, if the Borrower achieves a Total Leverage Ratio of less than 2.50:1.00 as of the last day of such fiscal year. 
  55 


(e) In the event that the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall receive Net Cash Proceeds from the
issuance or incurrence of Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than any cash proceeds from the issuance or incurrence of Indebtedness for borrowed money permitted pursuant to Section 6.01), the Borrower shall, substantially
simultaneously with (and in any event not later than the Business Day next following) the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds the Borrower or such Subsidiary, apply an amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds to prepay outstanding Term Loans in
accordance with Section 2.13(g).  (f) Upon receipt of notice and upon the request of the Administrative Agent, if the L/C
Exposure shall exceed the L/C Commitment on any date, the Borrower shall (i) Cash Collateralize such excess with an amount in cash equal to 105% of such excess as of such date or (ii) provide a backstop letter of credit in a face amount
equal to 105% of such excess as of such date from an issuer and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and each applicable Issuing Bank. 
(g) Mandatory prepayments of outstanding Term Loans under this Agreement shall be allocated pro rata between the Term Loans and the Other
Term Loans, if any, (based on their relative outstanding principal amounts) and shall be applied in the direct order of maturity against the scheduled installments of principal due in respect of the Term Loans and the Other Term Loans under
Sections 2.11(a)(i) and (ii), respectively, following the date of such prepayment.  (h) The Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent, at the time of each prepayment required under this Section 2.13, (i) a certificate signed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amount of such
prepayment and (ii) to the extent practicable, at least three Business Days prior written notice of such prepayment. Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date, the Class and Type of each Loan being prepaid and the
principal amount of each Loan (or portion thereof) to be prepaid. All prepayments of Borrowings under this Section 2.13 shall be subject to Section 2.05(e) (to the extent applicable) and Section 2.16, but shall
otherwise be made without premium or penalty, and (other than prepayments of ABR Revolving Loans that are not made in connection with the termination or permanent reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments) shall be accompanied by accrued and
unpaid interest on the principal amount to be prepaid to but excluding the date of payment.  SECTION 2.14. Reserve Requirements;
Change in Circumstances. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Change in Law shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, liquidity or similar requirement against assets of, deposits
with, or for the account of or credit extended by, any Lender or any Issuing Bank (except any such reserve requirement which is reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or shall impose on such Lender or such Issuing Bank or the London interbank market
any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any
Eurodollar Loan or increase the cost to any Lender or any Issuing Bank of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or purchasing or maintaining a participation therein or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or
such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) by an amount deemed by such Lender or such Issuing Bank to be material, then from time to time as specified in paragraph (c) below, the Borrower will pay to such Lender
or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
  56 


(b) If any Lender or any Issuing Bank shall have determined that any Change in Law regarding
capital adequacy or liquidity has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or such Issuing Banks capital or on the capital of such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made or participations in Letters of Credit purchased by such Lender pursuant hereto or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank pursuant hereto to a level below that which such Lender or such
Issuing Bank or such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or such Issuing Banks policies and the policies of such Lenders
or such Issuing Banks holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or such Issuing Bank to be material, then from time to time as specified in paragraph (c) below, the Borrower shall pay to such
Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
(c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amount or amounts (and the basis
thereof) necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as applicable, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The
Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank the amount shown as due on any such certificate delivered by it within 10 days after its receipt of the same. 
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts
received or receivable or reduction in return on capital shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or such Issuing Banks right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be under any obligation to
compensate any Lender or such Issuing Bank under paragraph (a) or (b) above with respect to increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the
Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or such Issuing Banks intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. The protection of this Section 2.14 shall be available to each Lender and each
Issuing Bank regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the Change in Law that shall have occurred or been imposed. 
  57 


SECTION 2.15. Change in Legality. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, if any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by written notice to the
Borrower and to the Administrative Agent:  (i) such Lender may declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter (for the
duration of such unlawfulness) be made by such Lender hereunder (or be continued for additional Interest Periods) and ABR Loans will not thereafter (for such duration) be converted into Eurodollar Loans, whereupon any request for a Eurodollar
Borrowing (or to convert an ABR Borrowing to a Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue a Eurodollar Borrowing for an additional Interest Period) shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR Loan (or a request to continue an ABR Loan as
such for an additional Interest Period or to convert a Eurodollar Loan into an ABR Loan, as the case may be), unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn (and each Lender shall promptly withdraw such declaration when such Lender
determines that the circumstances giving rise thereto no longer exist); and  (ii) such Lender may require that all
outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it be converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below. 
In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under paragraph (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have
been applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of,
such Eurodollar Loans.  (b) For purposes of this Section 2.15, a notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by any
Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period then applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the
Borrower.  SECTION 2.16. Breakage. The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss or expense that such Lender may
sustain or incur as a consequence of any event, other than a default by such Lender in the performance of its obligations hereunder, which results in (i) such Lender receiving or being deemed to receive any amount on account of the principal of any
Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the Interest Period in effect therefor, (ii) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan to an ABR Loan, or the conversion of the Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, in each case other than on the last
day of the Interest Period in effect therefor, (iii) any Eurodollar Loan to be made by such Lender (including any Eurodollar Loan to be made pursuant to a conversion or continuation under Section 2.10) not being made after notice of such Loan
shall have been given by the Borrower hereunder (whether or not such notice is permitted to be revoked, withdrawn or extended pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) or (iv) any Eurodollar Loan to be prepaid by the Borrower not being prepaid after
notice of prepayment of such Eurodollar Loan shall have been given by the Borrower hereunder (whether or not such notice is permitted to be revoked, withdrawn or extended pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) (any of the events referred to in
this sentence being called a Breakage Event). In the case of any Breakage Event, such loss shall include an amount equal to the excess, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining funds for the Eurodollar
Loan that is the subject of such Breakage Event for the period from the date of such 
  58 



Breakage Event to the last day of the Interest Period in effect (or that would have been in effect) for such Loan over (ii) the amount of interest such Lender is reasonably likely to realize
in redeploying the funds repaid or not utilized by reason of such Breakage Event for such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts which such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16 (and
setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations thereof and the basis therefor) shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
SECTION 2.17. Pro Rata Treatment. Except as provided below in this Section 2.17 with respect to Swingline Loans and
subject to the express provisions of this Agreement which require, or permit, differing payments to be made to Non-Defaulting Lenders as opposed to Defaulting Lenders, and as required under Section 2.15, each Borrowing, each payment or
prepayment of principal of any Borrowing (except Discounted Prepayment Offers made by the Borrower as provided in Section 2.25), each payment of interest on the Loans, each payment of the Commitment Fees, each reduction of the Term Loan
Commitments or the Revolving Credit Commitments and each conversion of any Borrowing to or continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective applicable
Commitments (or, if such Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans); it being acknowledged that this Section 2.17 shall not apply to any payment
received by any Lender as consideration for the assignment or participation in any Loan to any assignee or participant in accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of determining the available Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders at any
time (other than to the extent provided in Section 2.05(a)), each outstanding Swingline Loan shall be deemed to have utilized the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders (including those Lenders which shall not have made Swingline
Loans) pro rata in accordance with such respective Revolving Credit Commitments. Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lenders portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each
Lenders percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole Dollar amount.  SECTION 2.18. Sharing of Setoffs. Each
Lender agrees that if it shall, through the exercise of a right of bankers lien, setoff or counterclaim against the Borrower or any other Loan Party, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code or other security or
interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of any Loan
or L/C Disbursement as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of its Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements of any
other Lender, it shall be deemed simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at face value, and shall promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase price for, a participation in the Loans and L/C Exposure of such other Lender, so that
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans and L/C Exposure and participations in Loans and L/C Exposure held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans and L/C Exposure then
outstanding as the principal amount of its Loans and L/C Exposure prior to such exercise of bankers lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event was to the principal amount of all Loans and L/C Exposure outstanding prior to such

  59 



exercise of bankers lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; provided, however, that (i) if any such purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this
Section 2.18 and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase prices or adjustment restored without interest and
(ii) the provisions of this Section 2.18 shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower (including a Discounted Prepayment Offer made by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.25) pursuant to and in
accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment received by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any of its
Affiliates (as to which the provisions of this Section 2.18 shall not apply). The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Lender holding a participation in a Loan or L/C Disbursement deemed to have
been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of bankers lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan directly to the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.  SECTION 2.19. Payments. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment
(including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any L/C Disbursement, or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder and under any other Loan Document not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, on the date when due in immediately available
Dollars, without setoff, defense or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating
interest thereon. Each such payment (other than (i) Issuing Bank Fees, which shall be paid directly to the applicable Issuing Bank and (ii) principal of and interest on Swingline Loans, which shall be paid directly to the Swingline Lender
except as otherwise provided in Section 2.22(d)) shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 520 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10022 (or such other office as the Administrative Agent may specify in writing from time to
time to the Borrower and the Lenders). The Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender any payments received by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender. 
(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or
other amounts) hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.  SECTION 2.20. Taxes. (a) Except where required by a Governmental
Authority, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes. If the Administrative Agent or
any Loan Party determines, in its reasonable discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then the Administrative Agent or such Loan Party may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to 
  60 



additional sums payable under this Section 2.20) the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower or such other Loan Party shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower or such other Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.  (b) In addition, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.  (c) The Borrower or applicable Loan Party, as the case may be, shall indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or
with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable
under this Section 2.20) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and the calculation of the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on behalf
of itself, a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (d) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the
Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Loan Parties have not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(f) relating to the
maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the
Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the
Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (d). 
(e) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower or any other Loan Party to a Governmental
Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such
payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
  61 


(f) The Administrative Agent, each Lender, each SPV and each Issuing Bank (collectively,
Recipients and individually, a Recipient) that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) and that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and, if required, to any applicable Governmental Authority, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent
as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Recipient that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30)
of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Recipient becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of an SPV, on or prior to the date such SPV makes a Loan in
accordance with Section 9.04(i)) (and from time to time thereafter upon the expiration or invalidity of the certificate or any of the IRS forms described below, upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, or as
prescribed by applicable law), whichever of the following is applicable:  (i) two duly completed, executed, original copies
of IRS Form W-8BEN (or successor forms) establishing eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party or an exemption provided by the Code, 
(ii) two duly completed, executed, original copies of IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor forms), establishing that such Recipient is
not subject to deduction or withholding of United States Federal income tax,  (iii) in the case of such Recipient claiming
the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) two duly completed, executed, original copies of IRS Form W-8BEN (or successor forms), and (y) a certificate certifying that such Recipient is
not (A) a bank as such term is used in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower or of a guarantor or (C) a controlled
foreign corporation related, directly or indirectly, to the Borrower within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code, or 
(iv) in the case of such Recipient not being the beneficial owner, two duly completed, executed, original copies of IRS Form
W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a certificate as described in clause (iii)(y) immediately above, and/or IRS Form W-9, as applicable from each beneficial owner. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this paragraph, a Recipient shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section 2.20(f)
that such Recipient is not legally able to deliver.  (g) Each Recipient that is a United States person (as such term is defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) and that has not otherwise established to the 
  62 



reasonable satisfaction of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it is an exempt recipient (based on the indicators described in U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)
except to the extent required by U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-1(d)(4) (and any successor provision)) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Recipient becomes a party to this
Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the expiration or invalidity of any of the certificates or IRS forms described below, upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, or as prescribed by applicable law), two duly
completed, executed, original copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, is not subject to backup withholding, unless such Recipient is legally unable to provide IRS Form W-9 or is legally unable
to make such a certification.  (h) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax
imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under
FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (h), FATCA shall include any
amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  (i) If the Administrative Agent, the applicable Issuing Bank or a Lender
determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts
pursuant to this Section 2.20, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.20 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out of pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to
such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the applicable Issuing Bank or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by
the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (i), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (i) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a
less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or
additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section 2.20(i) shall not 
  63 



be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender to take any action that would be, in the sole and reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing
Bank or any Lender, legally or commercially or otherwise disadvantageous to a Lender in any respect or to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
 SECTION 2.21. Assignment of Commitments Under Certain Circumstances; Duty to Mitigate. (a) In the event (i) any Lender or any
Issuing Bank delivers a certificate requesting compensation pursuant to Section 2.14, (ii) any Lender or any Issuing Bank delivers a notice described in Section 2.15, (iii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any
Lender or any Issuing Bank or any Governmental Authority on account of any Lender or any Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.20, (iv) any Lender refuses to consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification of any Loan Document requested
by the Borrower that requires the consent of a greater percentage of the Lenders than the Required Lenders and such amendment, waiver or other modification is consented to by the Required Lenders or (v) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then,
in each case, the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort (including with respect to the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 9.04(b)), upon notice to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender or such Issuing Bank to transfer and assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this
Agreement (or, in the case of clause (iv) above, all of its interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Class of Loans or Commitments that is the subject of the related consent, amendment, waiver or other modification) to an Eligible
Assignee that shall assume such assigned obligations and, with respect to clause (iv) above, shall consent to such requested amendment, waiver or other modification of any Loan Documents (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts
such assignment); provided that (w) such assignment shall not conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction, (x) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent
of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Revolving Credit Commitment is being assigned, of each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender), which consents shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, (y) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to
the affected Lender or the affected Issuing Bank in immediately available funds an amount equal to the sum of the principal of and interest accrued to the date of such payment on the outstanding Loans or L/C Disbursements of such Lender or such
Issuing Bank, respectively, plus all Fees and other amounts accrued for the account of such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder with respect thereto (including any amounts under Sections 2.14 and 2.16) and (z) if such assignment is
in connection with a Lender that refuses to consent to an amendment, waiver or other modification with respect to a Repricing Event, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender the premium or fee set forth in Section 2.05(e) (to the extent
applicable), on or prior to the date of the consummation of such assignment; provided further that, if prior to any such transfer and assignment the circumstances or event that resulted in such Lenders or such Issuing Banks claim
for compensation under Section 2.14, notice under Section 2.15 or the amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.20, as the case may be, cease to cause such Lender or such Issuing Bank to suffer increased costs or reductions in amounts
received or receivable or reduction in return on capital, or cease to have the consequences specified in Section 2.15, or cease to result in amounts being payable under Section 2.20, as the case may be (including as a result of any
action taken by such Lender or 
  64 



such Issuing Bank pursuant to paragraph (b) below), or if such Lender or such Issuing Bank shall waive its right to claim further compensation under Section 2.14 in respect of
such circumstances or event or shall withdraw its notice under Section 2.15 or shall waive its right to further payments under Section 2.20 in respect of such circumstances or event or shall consent to the proposed amendment,
waiver, consent or other modification, as the case may be, then such Lender or such Issuing Bank shall not thereafter be required to make any such transfer and assignment hereunder. Each Lender and such Issuing Bank hereby grants to the
Administrative Agent an irrevocable power of attorney (which power is coupled with an interest) to execute and deliver, on behalf of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, as assignor, any Assignment and Acceptance necessary to
effectuate any assignment of such Lenders or such Issuing Banks interests hereunder in the circumstances contemplated by this Section 2.21(a). 
(b) If (i) any Lender or any Issuing Bank shall request compensation under Section 2.14, (ii) any Lender or any Issuing
Bank delivers a notice described in Section 2.15 or (iii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Issuing Bank or any Governmental Authority on account of any Lender or any Issuing Bank, pursuant
to Section 2.20, then such Lender or such Issuing Bank shall use reasonable efforts (which shall not require such Lender or such Issuing Bank to incur an unreimbursed loss or unreimbursed cost or expense or otherwise take any action
inconsistent with its internal policies or legal or regulatory restrictions or suffer any disadvantage or burden deemed by it to be significant) (x) to file any certificate or document reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower or
(y) if agreed to by the Borrower, to assign its rights and delegate and transfer its obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if such filing or assignment would reduce its claims for compensation under
Section 2.14 or enable it to withdraw its notice pursuant to Section 2.15 or would reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.20, as the case may be, in the future. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or any Issuing Bank in connection with any such filing or assignment, delegation and transfer. 
SECTION 2.22. Swingline Loans. (a) Swingline Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the
representations and warranties herein set forth, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to the Borrower at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date and until the earlier of the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and the
termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of all Swingline Loans exceeding $10,000,000 in the aggregate or (ii) the Aggregate
Revolving Credit Exposure, after giving effect to any Swingline Loan, exceeding the Total Revolving Credit Commitment. Each Swingline Loan (i) shall be made and maintained as an ABR Loan and (ii) shall be in a principal amount that is an integral
multiple of $100,000 and in a minimum amount of $500,000. The Swingline Commitment may be terminated or reduced from time to time as provided herein. Within the foregoing limits, the Borrower may borrow, pay or prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans
hereunder, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.22 or elsewhere in this Agreement, (i) the Swingline Lender shall not be obligated to make any
Swingline Loan at a time when any Revolving Credit Lender is a Defaulting Lender unless the Swingline Lender has entered into arrangements satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate the Swingline Lenders

  65 



risk with respect to any Defaulting Lenders participation in such Swingline Loans, including by cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lenders Pro Rata Percentage of the outstanding
Swingline Loans, and (ii) the Swingline Lender shall not make any Swingline Loan after it has received written notice from the Borrower, any other Loan Party or the Required Lenders stating that a Default or an Event of Default exists and is
continuing until such time as the Swingline Lender shall have received written notice (A) of rescission of all such notices from the party or parties originally delivering such notice or notices or (B) of the waiver of such Default or
Event of Default in accordance with Section 9.08(b).  (b) Swingline Loans. The Borrower shall notify, by delivery of a
Borrowing Request, the Swingline Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) by fax, or by telephone (promptly confirmed by fax), not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Such Borrowing Request
shall be delivered on a Business Day, shall be irrevocable and shall refer to this Agreement and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of such Swingline Loan and the wire transfer instructions for the account of
the Borrower to which the proceeds of the Swingline Loan should be disbursed. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan by wire transfer to the account specified in such request. 
(c) Prepayment. The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Swingline Loan, in whole or in part,
upon giving irrevocable written or fax notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written, or fax notice) to the Swingline Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) before 12:00 (noon), New York City time, on the date of prepayment at
the Swingline Lenders address for notices specified in Section 9.01.  (d) Participations. The Swingline Lender
may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on any Business Day, in its sole discretion, require the Revolving Credit Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a
portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding; provided that such notice shall be deemed to have been automatically given upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default under clause (g) or (h) of Section 7.01 or
upon the exercise of any of the remedies provided in the last paragraph of Section 7.01. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Revolving Credit Lenders will participate. The Administrative Agent will,
promptly upon receipt of such notice, give notice to each Revolving Credit Lender, specifying in such notice such Lenders Pro Rata Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Credit Lender hereby
irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Revolving Credit Lenders Pro Rata Percentage of such Swingline Loan
or Loans. Each Revolving Credit Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Credit Lender shall comply with its obligation
under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02(c) with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.02(c) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the

  66 



payment obligations of the Lenders) and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify
the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by
the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other Person on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the
Administrative Agent and any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their
interests may appear. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower (or other Person liable for obligations of the Borrower) of any default in the payment thereof. 
(e) Mandatory Borrowings. The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m., New
York City time, on any Business Day, in its sole discretion, require that the Swingline Lenders outstanding Swingline Loans shall be funded with one or more Borrowings of Revolving Loans; provided that such notice shall be deemed to
have been automatically given upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default under clause (g) or (h) of Section 7.01 or upon the exercise of any of the remedies provided in the last paragraph of
Section 7.01, in which case one or more Borrowings of Revolving Loans constituting Base Rate Loans (each such Borrowing, a Mandatory Borrowing) shall be made on the immediately succeeding Business Day by all Revolving
Credit Lenders based on their Pro Rata Percentage and the proceeds thereof shall be applied directly by the Administrative Agent to repay the Swingline Lender for such outstanding Swingline Loans. Each Revolving Credit Lender hereby irrevocably,
absolutely and unconditionally, agrees to make Revolving Loans upon one Business Days notice pursuant to each Mandatory Borrowing in the amount and in the manner specified in the preceding sentence and on the date specified in writing by the
Swingline Lender. Each Revolving Credit Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02(c) with respect to Loans made by such
Lender (and Section 2.02(c) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders) and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any Mandatory Borrowing made pursuant to this paragraph. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other Person on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan
after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a Mandatory Borrowing shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent and any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to
the Revolving Credit Lenders that shall have funded their obligations pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear. The refinancing of a Swingline Loan with a Mandatory Borrowing pursuant to this paragraph
shall not relieve the Borrower (or other Person liable for obligations of the Borrower) of any default in the payment of such Mandatory Borrowing. Mandatory Borrowings shall be made upon the notice specified in above, with the Borrower irrevocably
agreeing, by its incurrence of any Swingline Loan, to the making of the Mandatory Borrowings as set forth in this Section 2.22(e). 
  67 


(f) Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, in the event the Swingline Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that a Lender has not funded its participation pursuant to Section 2.22(d) or its pro rata share of a Mandatory
Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.22(e), the Borrower shall, upon demand by the Swingline Lender, pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender an amount equal to such Defaulting Lenders unfunded
participation or Pro Rata Percentage of the Loans required to be made pursuant to such Mandatory Borrowing, as the case may be, which amount shall be applied by the Administrative Agent solely to reduce the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Swingline Loans; provided that no such payment by the Borrower shall change the status of a Defaulting Lender as such, or otherwise limit, reduce or qualify the obligations of any Lender with respect to its obligations under this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents including without limitation to fund its Pro Rata Percentage of participations required by Section 2.22(d) or Loans made pursuant to a Mandatory Borrowing, in each case, after giving effect to any payments made
by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this sentence.  SECTION 2.23. Letters of Credit. (a) General. The
Borrower may request the issuance of a Letter of Credit for its own account or for the account of any of its Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (in which case the Borrower and such Wholly Owned Subsidiary shall be co-applicants with respect to such Letter of
Credit), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time while the L/C Commitment remains in effect as set forth in Section 2.09(a);
provided that all Letters of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars. This Section 2.23 shall not be construed to impose an obligation upon any Issuing Bank to issue any Letter of Credit that is inconsistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.23 or elsewhere in this Agreement, in the event that a Revolving Credit Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required
to issue any Letter of Credit unless such Issuing Bank has entered into arrangements satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate the Issuing Banks risk with respect to the participation in Letters of Credit by such Defaulting Lender,
including by (i) reallocating all or any part of such Defaulting Lenders participation in Letters of Credit among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with Section 2.23(j) and/or (ii) Cash Collateralizing such
Defaulting Lenders Pro Rata Percentage of each L/C Disbursement in accordance with Section 2.23(k).  (b) Notice of
Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions. In order to request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or to amend, renew or extend an existing Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or fax to the applicable Issuing
Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or
extended, the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) below), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary
thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare such Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if, and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit, the
Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that, after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the L/C Exposure shall not exceed $25,000,000 and (ii) the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure shall not
exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment. 
  68 


(c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at the close of business on the
earlier of the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit and the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, unless such Letter of Credit expires by its terms on an earlier date;
provided, however, that a Letter of Credit may, upon the request of the Borrower, include a provision whereby such Letter of Credit shall be renewed automatically for additional consecutive periods of 12 months or less (but not beyond the
date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date) unless the applicable Issuing Bank notifies the beneficiary thereof at least 30 days (or such longer period as may be specified in such Letter of Credit) prior to the
then-applicable expiration date that such Letter of Credit will not be renewed.  (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter
of Credit and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Credit Lender, and each such Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such
Letter of Credit equal to such Lenders Pro Rata Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, effective upon the issuance of such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing,
each Revolving Credit Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Lenders Pro Rata Percentage of each L/C Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank
and not reimbursed by the Borrower (or, if applicable, another party pursuant to its obligations under any other Loan Document) forthwith on the date due as provided in Section 2.02(f). Each Revolving Credit Lender acknowledges and
agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph (d) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance
of a Default or an Event of Default, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. 
(e) Reimbursement. If any Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent an amount equal to such L/C Disbursement, not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, on the immediately following Business Day. 
(f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrowers obligations to reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) above shall
be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, under any and all circumstances whatsoever, and irrespective of: 
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document, or any term or provision therein;
 (ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the provisions of any Letter of Credit or
any Loan Document; 
  69 


(iii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right that the
Borrower, any other Person guaranteeing, or otherwise obligated with, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof or any other Person may at any time have against the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank,
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other related or unrelated agreement or transaction; 
(iv) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient
in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;  (v) payment by the applicable Issuing
Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and 
(vi) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind of the applicable Issuing Bank, the Lenders, the Administrative
Agent or any other Person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.23, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the
Borrowers obligations hereunder.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that the
absolute and unconditional obligation of the Borrower hereunder to reimburse L/C Disbursements will not be excused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable
decision) of the applicable Issuing Bank. However, the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse such Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which
are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Banks gross negligence or willful misconduct in determining whether drafts and other documents presented
under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. It is further understood and agreed that the applicable Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless
of any notice or information to the contrary and, in making any payment under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, (i) such Issuing Banks exclusive reliance on the documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to
any and all matters set forth therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft presented under such Letter of Credit, and whether or not any document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect, if such
document on its face appears to be in order, and whether or not any other statement or any other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any
respect whatsoever, and (ii) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the documents presented under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in each case, be deemed not to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Issuing Bank (unless otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). 
  70 


(g) Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its
receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall, as promptly as possible, give telephonic notification, confirmed by fax, to the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Credit Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursement.  (h) Interim Interest. If
any Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement in full on such date, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest for
the account of such Issuing Bank, for each day from and including the date of such L/C Disbursement, to but excluding the earlier of the date of payment by the Borrower or the date on which interest shall commence to accrue thereon as provided in
Section 2.02(f), at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans.  (i) Resignation or Removal of an Issuing
Bank. Any Issuing Bank may resign at any time by giving 30 days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder by a Lender with the
consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in each case not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) that shall agree to serve as a successor Issuing Bank, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the interests, rights
and obligations of such retiring Issuing Bank. At the time such resignation shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all accrued and unpaid fees pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(ii). The acceptance of any appointment as an Issuing Bank
hereunder by a successor Lender shall be evidenced by an agreement entered into by such successor, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and, from and after the effective date of such agreement,
(i) such successor Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of such previous Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term Issuing
Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the resignation of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the retiring Issuing Bank
shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation, but shall not be
required to issue additional Letters of Credit.  (j) Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part
of any Defaulting Lenders participation in Letters of Credit shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Revolving
Credit Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the
Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting
Lenders 
  71 



Revolving Credit Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become
a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation. If the reallocation described in this Section 2.23(j) cannot, or can
only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, Cash Collateralize each Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.23(k).  (k) Cash Collateralization. 
(i) Defaulting Lenders. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one Business Day following the
written request of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize each Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after
giving effect to Section 2.23(j) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount. 
(ii) Event of Default. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Borrower shall (subject to the last
sentence of clause (v) of this Section 2.23(k)), on the Business Day it receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, the Majority Revolving Credit
Lenders), Cash Collateralize the L/C Exposure in an amount in cash equal to 105% of the L/C Exposure as of such date; provided that the obligation to Cash Collateralize shall become effective immediately, and such Cash Collateral will become
immediately payable in immediately available funds, without demand or notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default described in Section 7.01(g) or (h). 
(iii) Grant of Security Interest. The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing
Banks and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for (x) the Borrowers obligation to reimburse the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.23(e)
and/or the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of Letters of Credit and/or (y) the Borrowers other Obligations, in each case to be applied pursuant to clause (iv) below. If at any time the
Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the
Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will (subject to the last sentence of clause (v) of this Section 2.23(k)), promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash
Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency). 
  72 


(iv) Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.23 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied (x) to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of Letters of
Credit for which the Cash Collateral was so provided and (y) as set forth in clause (ii) above in connection with an Event of Default, in each case, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
Other than any interest earned on the investment of Cash Collateral in Permitted Investments, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent, Cash Collateral deposits shall not bear interest. Interest
or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account and shall be treated for all purposes as additional Cash Collateral. Such deposits shall (i) automatically be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing
Banks for L/C Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed and (ii) if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of the Majority Revolving Credit Lenders), be applied to satisfy the Obligations. 
(v) Termination of Requirement. If the Borrower is required to provide Cash Collateral hereunder as a result of a
Defaulting Lender, Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce any Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.23(k) following
(x) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (y) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks that there exists
excess Cash Collateral; provided that the Borrower and the Issuing Banks may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations; provided further that such Cash Collateral
shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Loan Documents. If the Borrower is required to provide Cash Collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. 
SECTION 2.24. Incremental Term Loans. (a) The Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent from time to time,
request Incremental Term Loan Commitments, in an aggregate amount not to exceed the Incremental Facility Amount, from one or more Incremental Term Lenders, all of which must be Eligible Assignees. Such notice shall set forth (i) the amount of
the Incremental Term Loan Commitments being requested (which shall be in minimum increments of $10,000,000 and a minimum amount of $50,000,000 or (x) such lesser amount equal to the remaining Incremental Facility Amount or (y) such lesser
increments and minimum amount as may be acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), (ii) the date on which such Incremental Term Loan Commitments are requested to become effective (which shall not be less than 10 Business
Days nor more than 30 days after the date of such notice, unless agreed to by the Administrative Agent) and (iii) state that such Incremental Term Loan Commitments are commitments to make additional Term Loans or commitments to make term loans
with terms different from the Term Loans (Other Term Loans). 
  73 


(b) The Borrower may seek Incremental Term Loan Commitments from existing Lenders (each of which
shall be entitled to agree or decline to participate in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other Lender, and until such time, if any, as such Lender has agreed in its sole discretion to provide an Incremental Term Loan Commitment and
executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower an Incremental Assumption Agreement as provided in this Section 2.24, such Lender shall not be obligated to fund any Incremental Term Loans) and additional banks,
financial institutions and other institutional lenders who will become Incremental Term Lenders in connection therewith. The Borrower and each Incremental Term Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Assumption
Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such Person. The terms and provisions of the Incremental Term Loans shall be identical to those of the
Term Loans except as otherwise set forth herein or in the Incremental Assumption Agreement. The Incremental Term Loans shall rank pari passu in right of payment and security with the Term Loans. Without the prior written consent of the
Required Lenders, (i) the final maturity date of any Other Term Loans shall be no earlier than the latest Maturity Date then in effect and (ii) the weighted average life to maturity of the Other Term Loans shall be no shorter than the
weighted average life to maturity of the Term Loans of any Class then outstanding. If the initial Yield on such Incremental Term Loans exceeds the then applicable Yield on any Class of Term Loans then in effect (including any previously issued
Incremental Term Loans) for Eurodollar Term Loans by more than 50 basis points (the amount of such excess above 50 basis points being referred to herein as the Yield Differential), then the Applicable Margin then in effect for
each such Class of Term Loans shall automatically be increased by the Yield Differential, effective upon the making of such Incremental Term Loans (it being understood and agreed, however, that any increase in Yield to any such Class of Term
Loans required due to the application of an Alternate Base Rate floor or Adjusted LIBO Rate floor on any Incremental Term Loans shall be effected, at the option of the Borrower, through an increase in (or implementation of,
as applicable) any Alternate Base Rate floor or Adjusted LIBO Rate floor applicable to such existing Class of Term Loans or an increase in the Applicable Margin with respect thereto or a combination thereof). The
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Incremental Assumption Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Assumption Agreement, this Agreement
shall be deemed amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Incremental Term Loan Commitments and the Incremental Term Loans evidenced thereby, and the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may
revise this Agreement to evidence such amendments (which may be in the form of an amendment and restatement). For purposes of this Section 2.24, Yield shall mean, as to any Class of Term Loans, the effective yield on
such Class of Term Loans as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent, taking into account the applicable interest rate margins, any interest rate floors or similar devices and all fees, including upfront or similar fees or original issue
discount (amortized over the shorter of (x) the life of such Class of Term Loans and (y) the four years following the date of incurrence thereof) payable generally to lenders making such Class of Term Loans, but excluding any arrangement,
structuring or other similar fees payable in connection therewith that are not generally shared with the relevant lenders. 
  74 


(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incremental Term Loan Commitment shall become effective
under this Section 2.24 unless (i) on the date of such effectiveness, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 4.01 shall be satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have received a
certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower, (ii) except as otherwise specified in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have received legal opinions,
board resolutions and other closing certificates reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent and consistent with those delivered on the Closing Date under Section 4.02, (iii) on the date of such effectiveness, the Borrower
would be in compliance with the applicable covenant level set forth in Section 6.11 (whether or not then in effect) and a Secured Leverage Ratio of no greater than 2.50:1.00, in each case, as of the most recently completed period of four
consecutive fiscal quarters for which the financial statements and certificates required by Section 5.04(a) or Section 5.04(b)(i), as the case may be, and Section 5.04(c) have been delivered, on a Pro Forma Basis,
after giving effect to the incurrence of such Incremental Term Loans and the application of proceeds thereof, (v) all fees and expenses owing in respect of such Incremental Term Loan Commitment to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall
have been paid in full and (vi) to the extent not consistent with this Agreement, the other terms and documentation in respect of the Incremental Term Loans shall otherwise be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(d) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may, in consultation with the Borrower, take any and all action as
may be reasonably necessary to ensure that all Incremental Term Loans (other than Other Term Loans), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of outstanding Term Loans on a pro rata basis. This may be accomplished (i) by allocating
a portion of each Incremental Term Loan to each outstanding Eurodollar Term Borrowing on a pro rata basis or (ii) with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), by requiring each outstanding Eurodollar Term
Borrowing to be converted into an ABR Term Borrowing on the date of each Incremental Term Loan. Any conversion of Eurodollar Loans to ABR Loans required by the immediately preceding sentence shall be subject to Section 2.16. If any
Incremental Term Loan is to be allocated to an existing Interest Period for a Eurodollar Term Borrowing, then the interest rate thereon for such Interest Period and the other economic consequences thereof shall be as set forth in the applicable
Incremental Assumption Agreement. In addition, to the extent any Incremental Term Loans are not Other Term Loans, the scheduled amortization payments under Section 2.11(a)(i) required to be made after the making of such Incremental Term
Loans shall be ratably increased by the aggregate principal amount of such Incremental Term Loans and shall be further increased for all Lenders on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary to avoid any reduction in the amortization payments to which
the Term Lenders were entitled before such recalculation.  SECTION 2.25. Discounted Voluntary Prepayments. 
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 2.12 or any other provision of this Agreement, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth or referred to below, the Borrower may from time to time, at its discretion, offer to prepay Term Loans at less than principal amount thereof (each, a Discounted Prepayment Offer), each such
Discounted Prepayment Offer to be managed exclusively by the Auction Manager, so long as the following conditions are satisfied: 
(i) each Discounted Prepayment Offer shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures, terms and conditions set forth in
this Section 2.25 and the Auction Procedures; 
  75 


(ii) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the
date of the delivery of any Auction Notice and at the time of prepayment of any Term Loans in connection with any Discounted Prepayment Offer; 
(iii) the minimum aggregate principal amount (calculated on the face amount thereof) of all Term Loans that the Borrower shall
offer to prepay in any such Discounted Prepayment Offer shall be no less than $25,000,000 (unless another amount is agreed to by the Administrative Agent); 
(iv) all Term Loans so prepaid by the Borrower shall automatically be cancelled and retired by the Borrower on the applicable
settlement date (and, for the avoidance of doubt, may not be reborrowed);  (v) no more than one Discounted Prepayment Offer
may be ongoing at any one time and no more than four Discounted Prepayment Offers may be made in any four-quarter period of the Borrower; 
(vi) the Borrower represents and warrants that, at the commencement and settlement of the Discounted Prepayment Offer, it does
not have material information regarding the Loans or the Borrower, the Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates that has not been disclosed to the Private Lenders; 
(vii) the Borrower would be in compliance with the applicable covenant level set forth in Section 6.11 (whether or
not then in effect) as of the most recently completed period of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which the financial statements and certificates required by Section 5.04(a) or Section 5.04(b)(i), as the case may be, and
Section 5.04(c) have been delivered on a Pro Forma Basis, after giving effect to each prepayment of the Term Loans made in accordance with this Section 2.25 as if such prepayment occurred on the first day of such period; 
(viii) each Discounted Prepayment Offer shall be open and offered to all Lenders of the relevant Class of Term Loans on a pro
rata basis;  (ix) no purchase of Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.25 shall be made with proceeds received
from the incurrence of Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans; and 
  76 


(x) at the time of the consummation of each purchase of Term Loans through a
Discounted Prepayment Offer, the Borrower shall have delivered to the Auction Manager and the Administrative Agent an officers certificate of a Responsible Officer certifying as to compliance with preceding clauses (ii), (vi), (vii) (and,
in the case of such clause (vii), showing the calculations therefor in reasonable detail) and (ix).  (b) The Borrower must terminate any
Discounted Prepayment Offer if it fails to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth above which are required to be satisfied at the time at which the Term Loans would have been prepaid pursuant to such Discounted Prepayment Offer. If the
Borrower commences any Discounted Prepayment Offer (and all relevant requirements set forth above which are required to be satisfied at the time of the commencement of such Discounted Prepayment Offer have in fact been satisfied), and if at such
time of commencement the Borrower reasonably believes that all required conditions set forth above which are required to be satisfied at the time of the consummation of such Discounted Prepayment Offer shall be satisfied, then the Borrower shall
have no liability to any Term Lender or any other Person for any termination of such Discounted Prepayment Offer as a result of its failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth above which are required to be satisfied at the time which
otherwise would have been the time of consummation of such Discounted Prepayment Offer, and any such failure shall not result in any Default or Event of Default hereunder. With respect to all prepayments of Term Loans made by the Borrower pursuant
to this Section 2.25, the Borrower shall pay on the settlement date of each such prepayment all accrued and unpaid interest (except to the extent otherwise set forth in the relevant Auction Procedures), if any, on the prepaid Term Loans
up to the settlement date of such prepayment.  (c) All Term Loan prepayments conducted pursuant to Discounted Prepayment Offers shall not
constitute voluntary or mandatory prepayments for purposes of Sections 2.12 and 2.13, but the face amount of the Term Loans prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.25 shall be applied pro rata against the remaining scheduled
installments of principal due in respect of the Term Loans.  (d) Immediately upon a prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this
Section 2.25, (x) such Term Loans and all rights and obligations as a Lender related thereto shall for all purposes (including under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and otherwise) be deemed to be irrevocably prepaid,
terminated, extinguished, cancelled and of no further force and effect and the Borrower shall neither obtain nor have any rights as a Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents by virtue of such payment and (y) the Borrower shall take
all actions necessary to cause such Term Loans to be extinguished or otherwise cancelled in its books and records in accordance with GAAP. 
(e) The Auction Manager acting in its capacity as such hereunder shall be entitled to the benefits of the provisions of Article VIII
and Section 9.05 to the same extent as if each reference therein to the Administrative Agent were a reference to the Auction Manager, and the Administrative Agent shall cooperate with the Auction Manager as reasonably
requested by the Auction Manager in order to enable it to perform its responsibilities and duties in connection with each Discounted Prepayment Offer. 
  77 


(f) No Lender shall be obligated or required to participate in any Discounted Prepayment Offer.
 SECTION 2.26. Defaulting Lenders. 
(a) Defaulting Lender Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Revolving Credit Lender
becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Revolving Credit Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law: 
(i) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or
consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.  (ii)
Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of any Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VII
or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.06 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of
any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Swingline Lender and any Issuing Bank hereunder; third, to Cash
Collateralize each Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.23(k); fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the
funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize each Issuing
Banks future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.23(k); sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to
the Lenders or the Issuing Banks as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or any Issuing Bank against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under
this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting
Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such
payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Disbursements in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a
time when the conditions set forth 
  78 



in Section 4.01 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Disbursements owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior
to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Disbursements owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit are held by the Revolving Credit Lenders pro rata in
accordance with the Revolving Credit Commitments without giving effect to Section 2.23(j). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting
Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.26 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
(iii) Certain Fees. (A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during
which that Revolving Credit Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such Commitment Fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender). 
(B) Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive L/C Participation Fees for any period during which that Revolving
Credit Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Pro Rata Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral. 
(C) With respect to any fees not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above,
the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lenders participation in Letters of Credit that has been reallocated to such
Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.23(j), (y) pay to each applicable Issuing Bank the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure
to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.  (b) Defaulting Lender Cure.
If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank agree in writing that a Revolving Credit Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date
specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Revolving Credit Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding
Loans of the other Revolving Credit Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held pro rata by the Revolving
Credit Lenders in accordance with the Revolving Credit Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.23(j)), whereupon such Revolving Credit Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made
retroactively with respect to actions taken by the Required Lenders (including approval of 
  79 



amendments, waivers and similar actions) and fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Revolving Credit Lender was a Defaulting Lender; provided,
further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Non-Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that
Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.  ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
The Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, each Issuing Bank and each of the Lenders, on the

obligations under each of the Loan Documents and each other agreement or instrument contemplated thereby to which it is or will be a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to borrow hereunder. 
SECTION 3.02. Authorization. The Transactions (a) have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate, partnership, limited
liability company, and, if required, stockholder, partner or member action, as applicable, of each Loan Party, (b) will not (i) violate (A) any provision of law, statute, rule or regulation, (B) any order of or undertaking with
any Governmental Authority or (C) any provision of any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them or any of their property is or may be bound, except such violation as

by each Loan Party party thereto, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each such Loan Party enforceable against each such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. 
SECTION 3.04. Governmental Approvals. The Transactions do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with,
certificate, certification, permit, license or authorization from, or any other action by any Governmental Authority, in each case, except for (i) the filing of Uniform Commercial Code financing statements and filings with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office and (if applicable) the United States Copyright Office, (ii) any other required filings in respect of any Collateral and (iii) such as have been made or obtained and are in full force and effect. 
SECTION 3.05. Financial Statements; Projections. (a) Reference is made to the consolidated balance sheets and related

thereon of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and Ernst & Young LLP for fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 included in the Borrowers respective Annual Reports on
Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, as filed with the SEC and (y) as of and for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013 and September 30, 2013, in each case included in the
Borrowers respective Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013 and September 30, 2013, as filed with the SEC and (ii) the Target (x) as of and for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2010, December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2012, and the reports thereon of Ernst & Young LLP for fiscal years ended December 31, 20,10, 2011 and 2012 included in the Targets respective
Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, as filed with the SEC and (y) as of and for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013 and September 30, 2013, in each case
included in the Targets respective Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013 and September 30, 2013, as filed with the SEC. Such financial statements present fairly in all
material respects the consolidated financial condition and results of operations and cash flows of each of the Borrower and the Target and their respective consolidated subsidiaries as of such dates and for such periods. Such balance sheets and the
notes thereto disclose all material liabilities, direct or contingent, of the Borrower and the consolidated Subsidiaries and the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries, as applicable, as of the dates thereof to the extent required to be disclosed
by GAAP. Such financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis except as otherwise noted therein subject, in the case of unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of
footnotes.  (b) Reference is made to the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and related pro forma statements of income and
statement of cash flows of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2013 set forth in the Confidential Information Memorandum, which give effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred, with respect to such balance sheet, on
such date and, with respect to such other financial statements, on the first day 
  81 



of the twelve month period ending on such date. Such pro forma financial statements (A) have been prepared in good faith by the Borrower, based on the assumptions used to prepare the pro
forma financial information contained in the Confidential Information Memorandum and stated therein (which assumptions are believed by management of the Borrower on the Closing Date to be reasonable) and are based on the best information available
to the Borrower as of the date of delivery thereof, (B) accurately reflect all material adjustments required to be made to give effect to the Transactions (other than detailed purchase accounting adjustments), (C) have been prepared on a
basis consistent with the audited financial statements of the Borrower for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, and (D) present fairly in all material respects on a pro forma basis the estimated consolidated financial position of the
Borrower and the consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and for such period, assuming that the Transactions had actually occurred at such date or at the beginning of such period, as the case may be. 
(c) Reference is made to the forecasts of financial performance of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries for the fiscal years 2014 through 2020
(the Projections) set forth in the Confidential Information Memorandum (Private Version). The Projections have been prepared in good faith by the Borrower and based upon (i) accounting principles consistent with the
historical audited financial statements of the Borrower for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, and (ii) assumptions that are believed by the Borrower in good faith to be reasonable at the time made and at the time the Projections
were made available to the Private Lenders (it being understood that the Projections are subject to uncertainties and contingencies, some of which are beyond the Borrowers control, that no assurance can be given by the Borrower that any
particular Projections will be realized, that actual results may differ, and that such differences may be material).  SECTION 3.06.
No Material Adverse Change. Since December 31, 2012, there has been change in the business, assets, liabilities, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower or any Subsidiary that has had, or could reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  SECTION 3.07. Title to Properties; etc. The Borrower and each Subsidiary has
good and valid title to, or valid leasehold interests in, or valid license to use, all its material properties and assets (including all material Real Property but excluding Intellectual Property which is addressed in Section 3.24), in
each case, except for minor defects that, individually or in the aggregate, do not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such properties and assets for their intended purposes. All such material
properties and assets are free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens.  SECTION 3.08. Subsidiaries.
(a) Schedule 3.08(a) sets forth, as of the Closing Date, a list of (i) the Borrower and each Subsidiary and its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization as of the Closing Date and (ii) all Subsidiaries and the direct or
indirect percentage ownership interest of the Borrower therein. The shares of capital stock or other ownership interests so indicated on Schedule 3.08(a) are duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable and are owned by the
Borrower or the respective Subsidiary thereof as indicated on such Schedule 3.08(a) (other than with respect to Subsidiaries that have been sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with Section 6.05), directly or indirectly,
free and clear of all Liens (other than (x) Liens created under the Security Documents, (y) in the case of shares of capital 
  82 



stock or other ownership interests constituting Collateral, any Permitted Liens that arise by operation of applicable legal requirements and are not voluntarily granted and (z) in all other
cases, any Permitted Liens).  (b) Schedule 3.08(b) sets forth, as of the Closing Date, (i) a list of the Immaterial
Subsidiaries and (ii) for each such Immaterial Subsidiary, the total assets and gross revenues of such Immaterial Subsidiary as of, and for the twelve month period ended on, September 30, 2013 and the percentage that such total assets and
gross revenues represent in relation to the Consolidated Total Assets and gross revenues of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries as of, and for the twelve month period ended on, such date. 
SECTION 3.09. Litigation; Compliance with Laws. (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.09(a), there are no actions,

notifications from, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, investigations by, any Governmental Authority regarding actual or potential violations of Health Care Laws by the Borrower or any Subsidiary (i) that involve any Loan Document, or the
Transactions or (ii) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse result that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 
(b) Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in violation of any law, rule or regulation (including all applicable Health Care Laws and
Environmental Laws), or is in default with respect to any judgment, writ, injunction, decree or order of or undertaking with any Governmental Authority, where such violation or default could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.  SECTION 3.10. Agreements. Neither the Borrower nor any of Subsidiary is in default in any manner under any provision
of any indenture or other agreement or instrument evidencing Indebtedness, or any other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets are or may be bound, where such default could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  SECTION 3.11. Federal Reserve Regulations. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is engaged or will engage, principally or as one of its important activities, in the business of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock (within the meaning of Regulation U), or extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
Margin Stock and no proceeds of any Borrowings or drawings under any Letter of Credit will be used, whether directly or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, for any purpose that entails a violation of, or that is
inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation T, U or X. As of the Closing Date and upon the consummation of the Merger, none of the Borrower or any other Loan Party owns Margin Stock as of the Closing Date. If at any time a Loan Party owns any
Margin Stock, the Borrower shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and, if requested by the Administrative Agent, each Loan Party will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a statement in conformity with the requirements of FR
Form G 3 or FR Form U 1, as applicable, referred to in Regulation U. At the time of each Credit Event, not more than 25% of the value of the assets of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole (including all capital stock of the Borrower
held in treasury) will constitute Margin Stock. 
  83 


SECTION 3.12. Investment Company Act; etc. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is
(a) an investment company or a company controlled by an investment company as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or (b) subject to regulation
under any requirement of law (other than Regulation X) that limits its ability to incur, create, assume or permit to exist Indebtedness or grant any Guarantee in respect of Indebtedness. 
SECTION 3.13. Use of Proceeds. The Borrower will (a) use the proceeds of the Loans and will request the issuance of Letters
of Credit only for the purposes specified in the introductory statement to this Agreement and (b) use the proceeds of Incremental Term Loans only for the purposes specified in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement. 
SECTION 3.14. Tax Matters. Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each of the Borrower and
the Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be timely filed all Federal, state local and foreign tax returns required to have been filed by it and all such tax returns are true and correct and has duly paid or caused to be duly paid all taxes
(whether or not shown on any tax return) due and payable by it and all assessments received by it, except taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as applicable, shall
have set aside on its books adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP. There is no tax assessment, deficiency, audit or other proceeding proposed in writing against the Borrower or any Subsidiary that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.  SECTION 3.15. No Material Misstatements. None of (a) the Confidential Information Memorandum (excluding
general market data not prepared by or specific to the Borrower and the Subsidiaries) or (b) any other written information, report, financial statement, exhibit or schedule furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender with respect to the Borrower and the Subsidiaries in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or included therein or delivered pursuant thereto (as modified or supplemented by other information so
furnished), taken as a whole, contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were or are made, not misleading; provided
that to the extent the Confidential Information Memorandum or any other such information, report, financial statement, exhibit or schedule was based upon or constitutes a forecast or projection, the Borrower represents only that it acted in good
faith and upon assumptions believed by management of the Borrower to be reasonable at the time delivered, and exercised due care in the preparation of such information, report, financial statement, exhibit or schedule. 
SECTION 3.16. Plans. (a) The Borrower, each Subsidiary and each of their respective ERISA Affiliates are in compliance with
the applicable provisions of ERISA with respect to all Plans, other than noncompliance which could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each Plan complies, and is operated and maintained in compliance, with all
applicable legal requirements, including all applicable provisions of ERISA 
  84 



and the Code, other than any such noncompliance which could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of
the Code has received a favorable determination (or, if such Plan uses a prototype or volume submitter plan document has received a favorable opinion or advisory) from the Internal Revenue Service that the form meets the tax qualification
requirements and nothing has occurred which would prevent, or cause the loss of, such qualification  (b) No ERISA Event has occurred or
is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Within the last six years, no Plan has been terminated, whether or not in a
standard termination as that term is used in Section 4041 of ERISA, nor has any Plan (determined at any time within the last six years) with an Unfunded Pension Liability been transferred outside of the controlled group
(within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA) of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any of their ERISA Affiliates. Using actuarial assumptions and computation methods consistent with subpart I of subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA, the
aggregate liabilities of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any of their ERISA Affiliates to all Multiemployer Plans in the event of a complete withdrawal therefrom, as of the close of the most recent fiscal year of each such Multiemployer Plan, have
not resulted in, and could not reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect.  SECTION 3.17. Environmental
Matters. Except with respect to any matters that could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, none of the Borrower or any Subsidiary (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or
comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, or (iii) is subject to any pending or threatened (in writing) action, suit, claim,
investigation, or other judicial or administrative proceeding by any Person under any Environmental Law.  SECTION 3.18.
Insurance. Schedule 3.18 sets forth a true, complete and correct description of all insurance maintained by the Borrower and any Subsidiary as of the Closing Date. As of the Closing Date, such insurance is in full force and effect. The
Borrower and the Subsidiaries maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurers, such insurance as may customarily be carried or maintained under similar circumstances by Persons of established reputation engaged in similar businesses, in such
amounts (giving effect to self-insurance), with such deductibles, covering such risks and otherwise on such terms and conditions as are customary for such Persons. 
SECTION 3.19. Security Documents. (a) The Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, upon execution and delivery thereof by the
parties thereto, will create in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral (as defined in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement) and (i) when the
Pledged Collateral (as defined in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement) is delivered to the Collateral Agent together with stock, membership interest powers or other appropriate instruments of transfer duly executed in blank, the Lien created
under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected first priority Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest of the Loan Parties party thereto in such Pledged Collateral, in each case prior and
superior in right to any other Person, and subject only to Permitted Liens that arise 
  85 



by operation of applicable legal requirements and are not voluntarily granted, and (ii) when financing statements in appropriate form are filed in the offices specified on Schedule
3.19(a), the Lien created under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement will constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all of the right, title and interest of the Loan Parties party thereto in such Collateral (other than
Company Intellectual Property) to the extent a security interest may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement pursuant to the UCC, in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person, and subject only to Permitted Liens. 
(b) Upon the recordation of the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (or a short-form security agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Collateral Agent) with, as and if applicable, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office, together with the financing statements or such other filings in appropriate form
filed in the offices specified on Schedule 3.19(a), the Lien created under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all of the right, title and interest of the Loan Parties
party thereto in the Company Intellectual Property to the extent a security interest may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement pursuant to the UCC and/or such recordation in, as applicable, the United States Patent and Trademark Office
and the United States Copyright Office, in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person, and subject only to Permitted Liens (it being understood that subsequent filings and recordings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office
and the United States Copyright Office may be necessary with respect to U.S. issued patents and U.S. patent applications, U.S. trademark registrations and U.S. trademark applications and U.S. copyright registrations acquired by the applicable Loan
Parties after the date hereof).  (c) Any Mortgage executed by a Loan Party pursuant to Section 5.12(c) shall, after the execution
and delivery thereof, be effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable Lien on all of the applicable Loan Parties right, title and interest in and to the Mortgaged
Property thereunder and the proceeds thereof, and when such Mortgage is filed in the applicable office and all related recording fees paid, such Mortgage shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and
interest of the Loan Parties party thereto in such Mortgaged Property and the proceeds thereof, prior and superior in right to any other Person, and subject only to Permitted Liens. 
SECTION 3.20. Location of Real Property and Leased Premises. (a) As of the Closing Date, neither the Borrower nor any other
Loan Party owns in fee any Real Property.  (b) Schedule 3.20 contains a true and complete list of each interest in each applicable
Leasehold of each Loan Party as of the Closing Date and the addresses (including street addresses, counties and states) of all applicable leases, subleases, franchises or licenses thereof.

no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened, (ii) the hours worked by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have

  86

any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or
such Subsidiary. As of the Closing Date, neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a party to any collective bargaining agreement. 
SECTION 3.22. Solvency. Immediately after the consummation of the Transactions to occur on the Closing Date and immediately
following the making of each Loan and the occurrence of each other Credit Event and after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of each Loan, (a) the fair value of the assets of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, at
a fair valuation, will exceed the debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (b) the present fair saleable value of the property of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, will be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of the debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as such debts
and other liabilities become absolute and matured; (c) the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be able to pay the debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (d) the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the business in which they are engaged as such
business is now conducted and is proposed to be conducted following the Closing Date (Solvent).  SECTION 3.23.
Merger Documents. As of the Closing Date, all representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Documents (with respect to the representations and warranties of the Target set forth therein, to the knowledge of the Borrower) were true
and correct in all material respects at the time as of which such representations and warranties were made (or deemed made).

and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, none of their respective Affiliates is in violation in any material respect of any applicable law, rule or regulation relating to terrorism or money laundering (Anti-Terrorism Laws),
including Executive Order No. 13224 on Terrorist Financing, effective September 24, 2001 (the Executive Order), and the USA PATRIOT Act.

Borrowings on the Closing Date under this Section 4.02 and (ii) any such unperfected security interest shall be granted, created and perfected within 90 days after the Closing Date (or such later date as the Administrative

undischarged for a period of 30 consecutive days during which execution shall not be effectively stayed, or any action shall be legally taken by a judgment creditor to levy upon assets or properties of the Borrower or any Subsidiary to enforce any
such judgment and such judgment either (i) is for the payment of money in an aggregate amount of $35,000,000 or more (to the extent that such payment is not covered by insurance from an unaffiliated insurance company with an A.M. Best financial
strength rating of at least A- at the time of the judgment, it being understood that even if such amounts are covered by insurance from such an insurance company, such amounts shall count against such basket if responsibility for such amounts has
been denied by such insurance company or such insurance company has not been promptly notified of such amounts or such insurance company is not participating in the defense thereof with customary diligence (as reasonably determined by the
Administrative Agent)) or (ii) is for injunctive relief and could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

applicable Collateral in a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents, (ii) as a result of the Collateral Agents failure to maintain possession of any stock certificates, promissory notes or other instruments delivered to it under the
Guarantee and Collateral Agreement or (iii) any such loss of perfection or priority results from the failure of the Collateral Agent to maintain possession of certificates actually delivered to it representing securities pledged under the
Guarantee and Collateral Agreement; or 
  123 


(m) there shall have occurred a Change in Control; 
then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to the Borrower described in paragraph (g) or (h) above), and at any
time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders (or, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing as a result of the Borrowers failure to perform or observe any
term, covenant or agreement contained in Section 6.11, at the written request of, or with the consent of, the Majority Revolving Credit Lenders only, and in such case, without limiting Section 7.01(d), only with respect to
the Revolving Credit Commitments, the Letters of Credit and the Revolving Loans and related Obligations) shall, by notice to the Borrower, take one or more of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate forthwith the
Commitments; (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be forthwith due and payable in whole or in part, whereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees

the Borrower, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding; and (iii) exercise (and/or direct the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent to exercise) any and all of its (or the Administrative
Agents or the Collateral Agents) other rights and remedies hereunder, under the other Loan Documents and/or under applicable law; and in any event with respect to the Borrower described in paragraph (g) or (h) above, the
Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other liabilities of the Borrower accrued hereunder and under any other Loan
Document, shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the
contrary notwithstanding.  SECTION 7.02. Application of Proceeds. 
(a) The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall apply (x) the proceeds of any collection, sale, foreclosure or other
realization upon any Collateral, including any Collateral consisting of cash, and (y) any amounts received in respect of the Obligations following the termination of the Commitments and any of the Loans becoming due and payable pursuant to
Section 7.01, in each case as follows:  FIRST, to the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent
or the Collateral Agent (in their respective capacities as such hereunder or under any other Loan Document) in connection with any collection, sale, foreclosure or realization or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document
or any of the Obligations, including all court costs and the fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document on
behalf of any Loan Party, any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document, any amounts for which the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent is entitled

respective capacities as such hereunder or under any other Loan Document; 
  124 


SECOND, to the payment in full of Unfunded Advances/Participations (the amounts so applied to be
distributed among the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Banks pro rata in accordance with the amounts of Unfunded Advances/Participations owed to them on the date of any such distribution); 
THIRD, to the payment in full of all Obligations owed by any Loan Party to each Issuing Bank, in its capacity as such hereunder or under any
other Loan Document;  FOURTH, to the payment in full of all Obligations consisting of accrued and unpaid L/C Participation Fees and
Commitment Fees (subject to the express provisions of this Agreement which require, or permit, differing payments to be made to Non-Defaulting Lenders as opposed to Defaulting Lenders), interest (including interest accruing during the pendency of
any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar proceeding, regardless of whether allowed or allowable in such proceeding) on the Loans, and scheduled periodic payments then due under any Secured Hedging Agreement and any interest with
respect to the Secured Hedging Agreements (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the Secured Parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of such Obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution); 
FIFTH, to the payment in full of all Obligations (including monetary obligations incurred during the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency,

Agent, for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Lenders, an amount in cash equal to 105% of the L/C Exposure as of such date; and  EIGHTH,

and the Collateral Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys, balances or amounts in accordance with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Upon any sale of Collateral by the Collateral
Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or 
  125 



under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the Collateral Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and
such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Collateral Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof. 
SECTION 7.03. Sharing of Payments After Acceleration or Certain Events of Default. If, at any time after the occurrence of
(a) the acceleration of the Loans pursuant to the last paragraph Section 7.01 or (b) an Event of Default under Section 7.01(g) or Section 7.01(h), the Revolving Credit Lenders or the Term Lenders (each,
a Group) shall obtain aggregate payments or other recoveries (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of offset or otherwise) on account of principal of or interest on any Loan made or any reimbursement obligations
with respect to any Letter of Credit issued (collectively, the Specified Obligations), in excess of such Groups pro rata share (based on such Groups percentage of the aggregate amount of all such Specified
Obligations then owed to all Lenders hereunder), then each Lender in the Group receiving such excess payment (the Benefitted Group) shall promptly (a) purchase (for cash at face value and based on such Lenders
Term Pro Rata Share (as defined below) or Pro Rata Percentage (as applicable) participations in the Specified Obligations of each Lender in the other Group in order to cause the Lenders in the Benefitted Group to share the excess payment or recovery
ratably with the Lenders in the other Group and (b) pay such excess to (or as otherwise directed by) the Administrative Agent in order to effectuate such participations; provided that if all or any part of the payment or other recovery
that gave rise to any such excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from one or more of the Lenders in the Benefitted Group, then each Lender in the other Group shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Benefitted Group, the amount necessary to ensure that the Lenders in each Group receive in the aggregate such Groups pro rata share of all such payments or other recoveries received by both Groups in the aggregate. The obligation of each
Lender of each Group to make its share of any payment required under this Section 7.03 shall be several, and not joint or joint and several, and shall be in addition to, and without limitation of, any requirement under
Section 2.18. The provisions of this Section 7.03 are solely an agreement among the Lenders (and not with the Borrower) for the benefit of the Lenders and are not for the benefit of (and may not be enforced by) the Borrower
or any other Person. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders may, without the consent of any Loan Party or any other Person, make arrangements among themselves to amend or otherwise modify this Section 7.03 and to establish different
sharing arrangements with respect to payments and other recoveries hereunder in respect of Specified Obligations; provided that any such amendment, modification or sharing arrangement shall be consented to by all Lenders directly and
adversely affected thereby. As used herein, Term Pro Rata Share shall mean, with respect each Term Lender at any time, a fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the principal amount of outstanding
Term Loans of such Lender at such time and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Term Loans at such time. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 7.03, the Administrative Agent and each Lender agree that (i) if the Administrative Agent
or a Lender is required under applicable law to withhold or deduct any taxes or other amounts from payments made by it hereunder or as a result hereof, such Person shall be entitled to withhold or deduct such amounts and pay over such taxes

  126 



or other amounts to the applicable Governmental Authority imposing such tax without any obligation to indemnify the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to such amounts and without any
other obligation of gross up or offset with respect thereto and there shall be no recourse whatsoever by the Administrative Agent or any Lender subject to such withholding against the Administrative Agent or any other Lender making such withholding
and paying over such amounts, but without diminution of the rights of the Administrative Agent or such Lender subject to such withholding as against the Borrower and the other Loan Parties to the extent (if any) provided in this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, as between the Borrower and the Lenders, all recoveries as specified in the first sentence of this Section 7.03 will be made in full compliance with applicable law. Any
amounts so withheld or deducted shall be treated as, for the purpose of this Section 7.03, having been paid to the Administrative Agent or such Lender with respect to which such withholding or deduction was made. 
ARTICLE VIII  THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT; ETC.  Each Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints Jefferies
Finance LLC, as its Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank and each other Secured Party hereby irrevocably appoints Jefferies Finance LLC as its Collateral Agent (for purposes of this Article VIII, the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent are referred to collectively as the Agents), and Jefferies Finance LLC hereby accepts each such appointment. Each Lender, each Issuing Bank and each other Secured Party hereby authorizes the Agents to take such
actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to such Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Agents are hereby expressly authorized to (i) execute any and all documents (including releases) with respect to the Collateral and the rights of the Secured Parties with respect thereto, as contemplated by and in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement and the Security Documents, (ii) negotiate, enforce or settle any claim, action or proceeding affecting the Lenders in their capacity as such, at the direction of the Required Lenders, which negotiation, enforcement or
settlement will be binding upon each Lender and (iii) in the event of a foreclosure by any of the Agents on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or a sale of any of the Collateral pursuant to Section 363 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale and the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Lenders (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or
their respective individual capacities unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, with the consent or at the direction of the Required Lenders, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the
purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by the Administrative Agent at such sale. It is understood
and agreed that the use of the term Agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or
express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
  127 


The institution serving as the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent hereunder shall
have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless
the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as an Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder. 
Neither Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be
administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) neither Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
(b) neither Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that such Agent is instructed in writing to exercise by the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.08); provided that neither Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion
or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law
or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, neither Agent shall have any duty to disclose,
nor shall it be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent or any of its
Affiliates in any capacity. Neither Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 9.08) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment. Neither Agent shall be deemed to
have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and neither Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants,
agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument
or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent. Each party to this Agreement
acknowledges and agrees that each Agent may from time to time use one or more outside service providers for the tracking of all UCC financing statements (and/or other collateral related filings and registrations from

  128 



time to time) required to be filed or recorded pursuant to the Loan Documents and the notification to such Agent, of, among other things, the upcoming lapse or expiration thereof. Neither any
Agent nor any of its officers, partners, directors, employees or agents shall be liable to the Lenders for any action taken or omitted by any Agent under or in connection with any of the Loan Documents. 
Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, internet or intranet website posting or other distribution)) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. Each Agent may also
rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a
Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, each Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such Issuing Bank unless such Agent
shall have received written notice to the contrary from such Lender or such Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower),
independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. No Agent shall be responsible for or have a duty to
ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Collateral Agents Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan
Party in connection therewith, nor shall either Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral. 
Each Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document by or
through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it. Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory, indemnification and other
provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Credit Facilities as
well as activities as Agent. The Agents shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agent except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that such Agent acted
with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agent.  Subject to the elapsing of the 30-day period for the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, either Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with, so long
as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the approval of the Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and which approval shall be deemed to have been given by the Borrower if the Borrower has
not responded within five Business Days of a request for such approval), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent
gives notice of its resignation, 
  129 



then the retiring Agent may, with, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the approval of the Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed and which approval shall be deemed to have been given by the Borrower if the Borrower has not responded within five Business Days of a request for such approval), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Agent
which shall be a bank or other financial institution with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank or other financial institution. If no successor Agent has been appointed pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence by
the 30th day after the date such notice of resignation was given by such Agent, such Agents resignation shall become effective and the Required Lenders shall thereafter perform all the duties of such Agent hereunder and/or under any other Loan
Document until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint, with, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the approval of the Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and
which approval shall be deemed to have been given by the Borrower if the Borrower has not responded within ten Business Days of a request for such approval), a successor Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as the case may be. 
Any such resignation by such Agent hereunder shall also constitute, to the extent applicable, its resignation as an Issuing Bank and the
Swingline Lender, in which case such resigning Agent (x) shall not be required to issue any further Letters of Credit or make any additional Swingline Loans hereunder and (y) shall maintain all of its rights as Issuing Bank or Swingline
Lender, as the case may be, with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it, or Swingline Loans made by it, prior to the date of such resignation. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall
be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After an Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.05 shall continue in
effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while acting as Agent. 
The Collateral Agent, the successor Agent, the Lenders and the Loan Parties shall execute all documents and take all other actions necessary
or in the opinion of successor Agent reasonably desirable in connection with the substitution by successor Agent of Collateral Agent as holder of the security under the Loan Documents, all in accordance with applicable law. 
In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relating to the Loan Documents relative
to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or Letter of Credit shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent
shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid
in respect of the Loans, Letters of Credit and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Agents (including
any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the 
  130 



Agents and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Agents under Sections 2.05 and 9.05) allowed in such judicial
proceeding; and to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same. Any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such
judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender, each Issuing Bank and the Collateral Agent to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Collateral Agent, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and
any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.05 and 9.05.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under
or based upon this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any provision of any other Loan Document, the Joint Lead Arrangers and the Senior
Managing Agents are named as such for recognition purposes only, and in its capacities as such shall have no duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document; it being understood and agreed that the
Joint Lead Arrangers and the Senior Managing Agents shall each be entitled to all indemnification and reimbursement rights in favor of the Agents provided herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Joint Lead
Arrangers and the Senior Managing Agents in their capacities as such shall not, by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, have any fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender, Loan Party or any other Person.

law, including United States Federal and state securities laws, to make reference to Communications that are not made available through the Public Side Information portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public
information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws.  THE PLATFORM
IS PROVIDED AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE. NEITHER THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT NOR ANY OF ITS RELATED PARTIES WARRANTS THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM AND EACH EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE COMMUNICATIONS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM
VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS IS MADE BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY OF ITS RELATED PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS OR THE PLATFORM. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY OF ITS RELATED PARTIES HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY
LOAN PARTY, ANY LENDER OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER OR NOT BASED ON STRICT LIABILITY AND INCLUDING DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF ANY LOAN PARTYS OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTS TRANSMISSION OF COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE LIABILITY OF ANY SUCH PERSON IS FOUND IN A FINAL AND NON-APPEALABLE DECISION BY A COURT OF
COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO HAVE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM SUCH PERSONS GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

The Administrative Agent agrees that the receipt of the Communications by the Administrative
Agent at its e-mail address set forth above shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to the Administrative Agent for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees that receipt of notice to it (as provided in the next sentence)
specifying that the Communications have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such Lender for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent in writing
(including by electronic communication) from time to time of such Lenders e-mail address to which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and that the foregoing notice may be sent to such e-mail address. Nothing herein
shall prejudice the right of the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent or any Lender to give any notice or other communication pursuant to any Loan Document in any other manner specified in such Loan Document. 
SECTION 9.02. Survival of Agreement. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower and the other
Loan Parties herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Lenders and the Issuing Banks and
shall survive the making by the Lenders of the Loans and the issuance of Letters of Credit by the Issuing Banks, regardless of any investigation made by the Lenders or the Issuing Banks or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect
as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any Fee or any other amount then payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the
Commitments have not been terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.16, 2.20, 9.05, 9.16 (for a period of one year after the termination of this Agreement) and 9.19 shall remain operative and in full
force and effect regardless of any termination of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Loans, the expiration of the Commitments, the expiration of any Letter of Credit, the invalidity
or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank. 
SECTION 9.03. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. 
SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference
shall be deemed to include the permitted successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Banks or the Lenders that are
contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective permitted successors and assigns.  (b) Each Lender
may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (provided 
  134 



that the consent of the Administrative Agent shall not be required to any such assignment of Term Loans made by a Lender to any of its Related Funds); provided, however, that (i) in
the case of an assignment of Revolving Loans or a Revolving Credit Commitment, the Borrower must also give its prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned and shall be deemed to
have been given by the Borrower if the Borrower has not otherwise rejected such assignment within five Business Days of a written request for such consent) (provided that the consent of the Borrower shall not be required to any such
assignment made (x) to another Lender or an Affiliate or Related Fund of a Lender or (y) after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default), (ii) in the case of an assignment of a Revolving Credit Commitment, the
Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank must also give its prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (iii) the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender
subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall be in an integral multiple of, and not less than, (A) $1,000,000 with
respect to Term Loans or Term Loan Commitments (or, if in connection with assignments made by Jefferies Finance LLC and its Affiliates during the primary syndication of the Term Loans or Term Loan Commitments, $500,000) and (B) $2,500,000 with
respect to the Revolving Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments (or, if less, the entire remaining amount of such Lenders Commitment or Loans of the relevant Class); provided that simultaneous assignments by two or more Related Funds of
a Lender shall be combined for purposes of determining whether the minimum assignment requirement is met, (iv) the parties to each assignment shall (A) execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance via an
electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent or (B) if previously agreed with the Administrative Agent, manually execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, and, in each case, shall pay
to the Administrative Agent a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee may be waived or reduced in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent), and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire (in which the assignee shall designate one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Loan Parties and their
respective Related Parties or their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignees compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws) and
all applicable tax documentation. Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 9.04, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (A) the assignee thereunder shall be
a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement and (B) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned
by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.16, 2.20 and 9.05, as well as to any Fees accrued for its account and not yet paid);
provided, however, notwithstanding any assignment by a Lender of all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall continue to be bound by the provisions of Section 9.16 for a period of one year
following any such assignment. 
  135 


(c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning Lender thereunder
and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby
free and clear of any adverse claim and that its Term Loan Commitment and Revolving Credit Commitment, and the outstanding balances of its Term Loans and Revolving Loans, in each case without giving effect to assignments thereof which have not
become effective, are as set forth in such Assignment and Acceptance; (ii) except as set forth in clause (i) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement, or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto, or the financial condition of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the performance or observance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any of its obligations under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee represents and warrants that it is an Eligible Assignee legally authorized to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee confirms that it has received
a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial statements referred to in Section 3.05(a) or delivered pursuant to Section 5.04 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate
to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (v) such assignee will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender
and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, respectively, by the terms hereof, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender. 
(d) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the City of New
York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of (and any stated interest on) the Loans owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Collateral Agent and the
Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the
Borrower, any Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent and any Lender (with respect to such Lenders own interest only), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
(e) Upon its receipt of, and consent to, a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, an
Administrative 
  136 



Questionnaire completed in respect of the assignee (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) above, if
applicable, and the written consent of the Administrative Agent and, if required, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender, and each Issuing Bank to such assignment and any applicable tax documentation, the Administrative Agent shall (i) accept such
Assignment and Acceptance and (ii) promptly record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph (e). 
(f) Each Lender may without the consent of the Borrower, any Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or the Administrative Agent sell
participations to one or more banks or other Persons in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided, however, that (i) such
Lenders obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the
participating banks or other Persons shall be entitled to the benefit of the cost protection provisions contained in Sections 2.14, 2.16 and 2.20 to the same extent as if they were Lenders (but no participant shall be entitled
to any greater payment thereunder than that to which the Lender that sold the participation to such participant would have been entitled had it not sold the participation) and (iv) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and
the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the
obligations of the Borrower relating to the Loans or L/C Disbursements and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents (provided that any Lender and any participating bank or
other Person of such Lender may agree that such Lender shall be required to seek consent from such participating bank or other Person with respect to any amendments, modifications or waivers decreasing any fees payable to such participating bank or
Person hereunder or the amount of principal of or the rate at which interest is payable on the Loans in which such participating bank or Person has an interest, extending any scheduled principal payment date or date fixed for the payment of interest
on the Loans in which such participating bank or Person has an interest, increasing or extending the Commitments in which such participating bank or Person has an interest or releasing one or more Subsidiary Guarantors (other than in connection with
the sale of any Subsidiary Guarantor in a transaction permitted by Section 6.05) that represent all or substantially all of the value of the Guarantees of the Obligations pursuant to the Loan Documents or all or substantially all of the
Collateral (it being understood and agreed, however, that any amendment or modification to the financial definitions in this Agreement or to Section 1.02 or 1.03 shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for
purposes of this clause (iv)). Each Lender that sells a participation or is a Granting Lender (as defined in paragraph (i) below) shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name
and address of each participant or SPV (as defined in paragraph (i) below) and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participants or SPVs interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the
Participant Register). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such
participation or interest in the Loan, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. To the 
  137 



extent permitted by law, each participating bank or other Person also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.06 as though it were a Lender, provided such participating
bank or other Person agrees to be subject to Section 2.18 as though it were a Lender.  (g) Any Lender or participant may, in
connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.04, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant any information relating to the Borrower
furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure of information designated by the Borrower as confidential, each such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall
execute an agreement whereby such assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of such confidential information on terms no less restrictive than those applicable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.16. 
(h) Any Lender may at any time assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure extensions of credit to such Lender or
in support of obligations owed by such Lender; provided that no such assignment shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a Granting Lender) may grant to a special
purpose funding vehicle (an SPV), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such
Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise
such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the respective Commitment of the
Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which
shall remain with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full
of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings
under the laws of the United States or any state thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.04, any SPV may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and Administrative Agent)
providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPV to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency,
commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPV. 
  138 


(j) The Borrower shall not assign or delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender, and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be null and void. 
SECTION 9.05. Expenses; Indemnity. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay promptly upon demand: 
(i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Senior Managing Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender, including (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 1(c) of the General Fee Letter) the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of
Advisors for the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Senior Managing Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender, in connection with the syndication of the Loans and the Commitments, the preparation,
negotiation, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the administration of the Credit Events and Commitments (including with respect to the establishment and maintenance of a Platform and the charges of IntraLinks, SyndTrak or a similar
service), the perfection and maintenance of the Liens securing the Collateral and any actual or proposed amendment, supplement or waiver of any of the Loan Documents (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
consummated ); and  (ii) all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Senior Managing Agents, the Issuing Banks, the Swingline Lender and any Lender, including the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of Advisors for any of the foregoing, incurred in connection
with the enforcement or protection of its rights under the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section 9.05(a), or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder and the collection of the Obligations,
including all such costs and expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of the Obligations; provided that, in the case of charges of outside counsel, such payment shall be limited to the fees, disbursements
and other charges of (x) one primary counsel for the Agents and the Lenders (taken as a group), (y) one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for the Agents and the Lenders (taken as a group) and (z) one regulatory counsel in
each relevant jurisdiction for the Agents and the Lenders (taken as a group) (and, in each case, in the case of an actual or a potential conflict of interest, (A) one additional counsel for each affected Person (or group of similarly affected
Persons) and (B) one local and/or regulatory counsel for each affected Person (or group of similarly affected Persons) in any relevant jurisdiction). 
(b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Senior Managing Agents,
each Lender, each Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons 
  139 



(each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses,
including reasonable Advisor fees, charges and disbursements incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto or thereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (including the syndication of the Credit Facilities), (ii) the use of the proceeds of the Loans or issuance of Letters of Credit, (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto (and regardless of whether such matter is initiated by a third party or by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates) or (iv) any actual or alleged presence or
Release of Hazardous Materials on any property currently owned or operated by the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or the Subsidiaries; provided that such indemnity shall
not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are (x) determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee (or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, partners, trustees, employees, agents, members, successors, assigns or controlling persons) or that are addressed in
paragraph (a) of this Section 9.05, (y) in respect of any settlement entered into by any Indemnitee without the prior written consent of the Borrower (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or
(z) attributable to Taxes (other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses arising from any non-Tax claim), which shall be governed solely by Section 2.20. 
(c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any
Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 9.05, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case
may be, such Lenders pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lenders pro
rata share shall be determined based upon its share of the sum of the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure, outstanding Term Loans and unused Commitments at the time (in each case, determined as if no Lender were a Defaulting Lender). 
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on
any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. 
  140 


(e) The provisions of this Section 9.05 shall remain operative and in full force and
effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Loans, the expiration of the Commitments, the expiration of any Letter of Credit, the invalidity
or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Swingline Lender, any Lender or any Issuing Bank. All amounts
due under this Section 9.05 shall be payable on written demand therefor.  SECTION 9.06. Right of Setoff. If an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender may, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (provided that no such consent shall be required if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing pursuant to
Section 7.01(g) or (h)), at any time and from time to time, except to the extent prohibited by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Loan Party, against any of and all the Obligations of the Borrower or other Loan Parties, now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such other Loan Document and although such obligations may be unmatured; provided, in the event that any Defaulting
Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (a) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.26 (to the extent
applicable) and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders, and (b) the Defaulting Lender
shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The applicable Lender shall endeavor to notify the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent of such setoff; provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff or application under this Section 9.06. The rights of each Lender under this
Section 9.06 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. 
SECTION 9.07. Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN LETTERS OF CREDIT OR AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY
SET FORTH IN OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. EACH LETTER OF CREDIT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OR RULES DESIGNATED IN SUCH
LETTER OF CREDIT, OR IF NO SUCH LAWS OR RULES ARE DESIGNATED, THE UNIFORM CUSTOMS AND PRACTICE FOR DOCUMENTARY CREDITS MOST RECENTLY PUBLISHED AND IN EFFECT, ON THE DATE SUCH LETTER OF CREDIT WAS ISSUED, BY THE INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (THE
UNIFORM CUSTOMS) AND, AS TO MATTERS NOT GOVERNED BY THE UNIFORM CUSTOMS, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
SECTION 9.08. Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Lender or
any Issuing Bank in exercising any 
  141 



power or right hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Banks and
the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any
departure by the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether any Agent, any Lender or
any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time. No notice or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
 (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in
the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent (in the case of any Security Document) and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with the written consent of the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such
agreement shall:  (i) decrease the principal amount of, or extend the maturity of or any scheduled principal payment date
of, or date for the payment of any interest on or any fees (including any prepayment fee or premium (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the fee set forth in Section 2.05(e)), but excluding any interest payable pursuant to
Section 2.07) payable with respect to, any Loan or any date for reimbursement of an L/C Disbursement, or waive or excuse any such payment or any part thereof, or decrease the rate of interest on or reduce any fees (including any
prepayment fee or premium (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the fee set forth in Section 2.05(e)), but excluding any interest payable pursuant to Section 2.07) payable with respect to any Loan or L/C Disbursement,
without the prior written consent of each Lender directly adversely affected thereby (it being understood and agreed that any amendment or modification to the financial definitions in this Agreement or to Section 1.02 or 1.03
shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (i));  (ii) increase or extend
the Commitment or decrease or extend the date for payment of any fees (including any prepayment fee or premium (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the fee set forth in Section 2.05(e))) of any Lender without the prior written consent
of such Lender (it being understood that no amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent with respect to any condition precedent, covenant, Default or Event of Default (or any definition used, respectively, therein) shall constitute an
increase in the Commitment of any Lender for purposes of this clause (ii)); 
  142 


(iii) amend or modify Section 2.17 or 7.02 in a manner that
would alter the order of or the pro rata sharing of payments or setoffs required thereby without the prior written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby (except for any such amendment or modification to reflect the addition of one or more
Classes of Loans in a manner consistent with the treatment of Obligations under Section 7.02 immediately prior to such amendment or modification) or change the provisions of any Loan Document in a manner that by its terms adversely
affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders holding Loans of one Class differently from the rights of Lenders holding Loans of any other Class without the prior written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the
outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of each adversely affected Class;  (iv) amend or modify the provisions of
Section 9.04(j) or the provisions of this Section 9.08 or release one or more Subsidiary Guarantors (other than in connection with the sale of such Subsidiary Guarantor in a transaction permitted by Section 6.05
or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Security Document) that represent all or substantially all of the value of the Guarantees of the Obligations pursuant to the Loan Documents or release all or substantially all of the
Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents or alter the relative priorities of the Obligations entitled to the Liens of the Security Documents (except in connection with securing additional Obligations equally and ratably with the other
Obligations), in each case without the prior written consent of each Lender;  (v) modify the protections afforded to an SPV
pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.04(i) without the written consent of such SPV;  (vi) reduce the

Agreement may be included in the determination of the Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Term Loan Commitments and Revolving Credit Commitments on the date hereof), or reduce the percentage contained in the definition of the

as a financial maintenance covenant but not as it relates to any incurrence-based test), (y) any Event of Default with respect to the Borrowers failure to comply with Section 6.11 (solely as a financial maintenance covenant
but not as it relates to any incurrence-based test) and (z) any definitions and related provisions related to the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) shall only require the prior written consent of the Majority Revolving Credit Lenders (and
not the Required Lenders). For the avoidance of doubt, (i) Letters of Credit and the provisions thereof may be waived, amended or modified solely in accordance with Section 2.23, (ii) the Fee Letters and the respective
provisions thereof may be waived, amended or modified solely in accordance with their respective terms and (iii) the provisions of Section 7.03 may be waived, amended or modified solely in accordance with the terms of such section.
 (c) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (b) above or otherwise herein to the contrary, (i) any amendment or modification
that would extend the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Lender or the final maturity date of the Term Loans or Revolving Loans of any Lender and increase the rate of interest and fees payable on the extended Revolving Credit Commitments, Term
Loans or Revolving Loans of such Lender shall not require the prior written consent of each Lender, so long as such extension is offered to all Lenders holding such Revolving Credit Commitments, Term Loans or Revolving Loans, as the case may be, on
a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount of such Revolving Credit Commitments, Term Loans or Revolving Loans then outstanding pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent, (ii) the payment in full of any Loans on
the applicable final maturity date of such Loans and the payment of interest and fees made on account of the Commitments or Loans of any Lender as required under this Agreement after giving effect to an amendment or other modification described in
the preceding clause (i), shall not be deemed to violate Section 2.17 or be an event that would require the purchase of participations pursuant to Section 2.18; provided that, except as expressly set forth in the
preceding clause (i), no such amendment or modification shall alter the pro rata requirements of Section 2.17, (iii) if the Borrower shall request (A) the release of any Collateral to be sold as part of any Asset Sale to any
Person other than the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries permitted under Section 6.05 and shall deliver to the Collateral Agent a certificate to the effect that such Asset Sale and the disposition of the proceeds thereof will comply
with the terms of this Agreement or (B) the release or subordination of the Lien of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, on any item of Collateral to be encumbered by any Lien permitted by Section 6.02(i) or
Section 6.02(k) and shall deliver to the Collateral Agent a certificate to the effect that the incurrence of such other Lien on the Collateral will comply with the terms of this Agreement, then the Collateral Agent, if reasonably
satisfied that the applicable certificate is correct, shall and is hereby authorized to, without the consent of any Lender, execute and deliver all such instruments as 
  144 



may be required to effect the release of such Collateral (in the case of an Asset Sale described in clause (A)) or the release or subordination of the Lien of the Collateral Agent, for the
benefit of the Secured Parties, in such Collateral (in the case of such other Lien as described in clause (B)) and (iv) the Collateral Agent, the Borrower and the applicable Subsidiary Guarantors may amend, supplement or otherwise modify any
Security Document so long as such amendment, supplement or other modification is not adverse to any Secured Party and such amendment shall become effective without any further consent of any other party to such Security Document. For the avoidance
of doubt, any amendment or modification of the type described in the preceding clause (i) will require an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders.

Document.  SECTION 9.09. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the
interest rate applicable to any Loan or participation in any L/C Disbursement, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan or participation in such L/C Disbursement under applicable law (collectively
the Charges), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan or participation in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan or participation hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that

participations or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.
