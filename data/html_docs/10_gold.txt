If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested LIBO Rate Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration. The Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details and amount of any Loan to be made as part of the relevant requested Borrowing (x) in the case of any ABR Borrowing, on the same Business Day of receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section 2.03 or (y) in the case of any LIBO Rate Borrowing, no later than one Business Day following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section 2.03.
 
Section 2.04.                          [Reserved].
 
Section 2.05.                          Letters of Credit.
 
(a)                                 General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) each Issuing Bank agrees, in each case in reliance upon the agreements of the other Revolving Lenders set forth in this Section 2.05, (A) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date to the thirtieth day prior to the Latest Revolving Credit Maturity Date, upon the request of the Borrower, to issue Letters of Credit (provided that no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue Commercial Letters of Credit without its consent) issued for the account of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary (provided that the Borrower will be the applicant and that each Letter of Credit shall be issued by a single Issuing Bank determined by the Borrower to the extent possible such that the Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit issued by an Issuing Bank does not exceed such Issuing Banks LC Commitment) and to amend or renew Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with Section 2.05(b), and (B) to honor drafts under the Letters of Credit, and (ii) the Revolving Lenders severally agree to participate in the Letters of Credit issued pursuant to Section 2.05(d).

To request the issuance of any Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall deliver to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent, at least three Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance (or such shorter period as is acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank or, in the case of any issuance to be made on the Closing Date, one Business Day prior to the Closing Date), a request to issue a Letter of Credit, which shall specify that it is being issued under this Agreement, in the form of Exhibit K. To request an amendment, extension or renewal of an outstanding Letter of Credit, (other than any automatic extension of a Letter of Credit permitted under Section 2.05(c)) the Borrower shall submit such a request to the applicable Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at least three Business Days in advance of the requested date of amendment, extension or renewal (or such shorter period as is acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank), identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, extended or renewed, and

If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank in connection with any request for any Letter of Credit, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Banks standard form. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the applicable Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. No Letter of Credit, letter of credit application or other document entered into by the Borrower with any Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit shall contain any representations or warranties, covenants or events of default not set forth in this Agreement (and to the extent inconsistent herewith shall be rendered null and void (or reformed automatically without further action by any Person to conform to the terms of this Agreement)), and all representations and warranties, covenants and events of default set forth therein shall contain standards, qualifications, thresholds and exceptions for materiality or otherwise consistent with those set forth in this Agreement (and, to the extent inconsistent herewith, shall be deemed to automatically incorporate the applicable standards, qualifications, thresholds and exceptions set forth herein without action by any Person). No Letter of Credit may be issued, amended, extended or renewed unless (and on the issuance, amendment, extension or renewal of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, extension, or renewal (i) the LC Exposure does not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, (ii) the aggregate Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit issued by an Issuing Bank does not exceed such Issuing Banks LC Commitment and (iii) (A) the aggregate amount of the Initial Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Initial Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect, (B) the aggregate amount of the Additional Revolving Credit Exposure attributable to any Class of Additional Revolving Credit Commitments does not exceed the aggregate amount of the Additional Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class then in effect and (C) if such Letter of Credit has a term extending beyond any Maturity Date applicable to the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class, the aggregate amount of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit expiring after such Maturity Date does not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect that are scheduled to remain in effect after such Maturity Date. Promptly after the delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable Issuing Bank will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (if so requested by the Administrative Agent) a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. Upon receipt of such Letter of Credit or amendment, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders, in writing, of such Letter of Credit or amendment, and if so requested by a Revolving Lender, the Administrative Agent will provide such Revolving Lender with copies of such Letter of Credit or amendment.
 
(c)                                  Expiration Date. No Letter of Credit shall expire later than the earlier of (A) the date that is one year (or, in the case of documentary letters of credit, 180 days) after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit and (B) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Latest Revolving Credit Maturity Date; provided that, any Letter of Credit may provide for the automatic extension thereof for any number of additional periods of up to one year in duration (which additional periods shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in the preceding clause (B) unless 103.0% of the Stated Amount thereof (minus any amount then on deposit in any Cash collateral account established for the benefit of the relevant Issuing Bank) is Cash collateralized or backstopped on or before the date that such Letter of Credit is extended beyond the date referred to in clause (B) above pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Issuing Bank on or prior to the date that is 5 Business Days prior to the Latest Revolving Credit Maturity Date).
 
(d)                                 Participations. By the issuance of any Letter of Credit (or an amendment to any Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, the applicable Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving
 
70





 
Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Revolving Lenders Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
 
(e)                                  Reimbursement.
 
(i)                                     If the applicable Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 3:00 p.m. one Business Day immediately following the date on which the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement under paragraph (g) of this Section 2.05; provided that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing in an equivalent amount (any such Revolving Borrowing in clauses (x) or (y), a Letter of Credit Reimbursement Loan) and, to the extent so financed, the obligation of the Borrower to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving Lenders Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.
 
(ii)                                  If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(e) by the time specified therein, such Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (A) the Administrative Agents customary rate for interbank advances in Dollars (or, if greater, the Federal Funds Effective Rate) from time to time in effect and (B) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A certificate of the
 
71





 
applicable Issuing Bank submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (ii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(f)                                   Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05 shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.05, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the obligations of the Borrower hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their respective Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse such Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Banks failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of any Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
 
(g)                                  Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by electronic means) upon any LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that no failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
 
(h)                                 Interim Interest. If any Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement, unless the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement (or the date on which such LC Disbursement is reimbursed with the proceeds of a Loan, as applicable), at the rate per annum then applicable to Initial Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans (or, to the extent of the participation in such LC Disbursement by any Revolving Lender of another Class, the rate per annum then applicable to the Revolving Loans of such other Class); provided that if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply.
 
72





 
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05 to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Revolving Lender to the extent of such payment and shall be payable on the date on which the Borrower is required to reimburse the applicable LC Disbursement in full (and, thereafter, on demand).
 
(i)                                     Replacement or Resignation of an Issuing Bank or Designation of New Issuing Banks.
 
(i)                                     Any Issuing Bank may be replaced with the consent of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement becomes effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b)(ii). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of any Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and the relevant Revolving Lender, designate one or more additional Revolving Lenders to act as an Issuing Bank under the terms of this Agreement. Any Revolving Lender designated as an Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph (i) who agrees in writing to such designation shall be deemed to be an Issuing Bank (in addition to being a Revolving Lender) in respect of Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Revolving Lender, and, with respect to such Letters of Credit, such term shall thereafter apply to the other Issuing Bank and such Revolving Lender.
 
(ii)                                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Issuing Bank may, upon thirty days (or if such Issuing Bank is also acting as the Administrative Agent and such resignation is submitted concurrently with such Persons resignation as the Administrative Agent pursuant to Article 8, upon ten days prior written notice) prior written notice to the Borrower, each other Issuing Bank and the Lenders, resign as Issuing Bank, which resignation shall be effective as of the date referenced in such notice (but in no event less than thirty days after the delivery of such written notice); it being understood that in the event of any such resignation, any Letter of Credit then outstanding shall remain outstanding (irrespective of whether any amounts have been drawn at such time). In the event of any such resignation as an Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint any Revolving Lender that accepts such appointment in writing as successor Issuing Bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Issuing Bank hereunder, the successor Issuing Bank shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank, and the retiring Issuing Bank shall be discharged from its duties and obligations in such capacity hereunder.
 
73





 
(j)                                    Cash Collateralization.
 
(i)                                     If any Event of Default exists and the Loans have been declared due and payable in accordance with Article 7 hereof, then on the Business Day on which the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Revolving Lenders demanding the deposit of Cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph (j), the Borrower shall deposit, in an interest-bearing account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders (the LC Collateral Account), an amount in Cash equal to 103.0% of the Stated Amount of any outstanding Letters of Credit as of such date (minus the amount then on deposit in the LC Collateral Account); provided that the obligation to deposit such Cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in Section 7.01(f) or 7.01(g).
 
(ii)                                  Any such deposit under clause (i) above shall be held by the Administrative Agent as Collateral for the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (j). The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account, and the Borrower hereby grants the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders and the Issuing Banks, a First Priority security interest in the LC Collateral Account. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of the Required Revolving Lenders) be applied to satisfy other Secured Obligations. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of Cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (together with all interest and other earnings with respect thereto, to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower promptly but in no event later than three Business Days after such Event of Default has been cured or waived.
 
(k)                                 Governing Law; Applicability of ISP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Issuing Bank and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, each Letter of Credit shall be governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with the rules of the ISP, and as to matters not governed by the ISP, the laws of the State of New York. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything else in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents to the contrary, the Issuing Bank shall not be responsible to the Borrower for, and the Issuing Banks rights and remedies against the Borrower solely in its capacity as an Issuing Bank shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of the Issuing Bank required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the applicable law or any order of a jurisdiction where the Issuing Bank or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice.
 
Section 2.06.                          [Reserved].
 
Section 2.07.                          Funding of Borrowings.
 
(a)                                 Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder not later than (i) 12:00 p.m., in the case of LIBO Rate Loans and (ii) 3:00 p.m., in the case of ABR Loans, in each case on
 
74





 
the Business Day specified in the applicable Borrowing Request by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders in an amount equal to such Lenders respective Applicable Percentage. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the account designated in the relevant Borrowing Request or as otherwise directed by the Borrower; provided that Letter of Credit Reimbursement Loans shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.
 
(b)                                 Unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from any Lender that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of any Borrowing prior to the proposed date of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section 2.07 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if any Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of (A) the rate of interest per annum at which overnight deposits in Dollars, would be offered for such day by the Administrative Agent in the applicable offshore interbank market for Dollars (or, if greater, the Federal Funds Effective Rate) and (B) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Loans comprising such Borrowing at such time. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing and the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount pursuant to this Section 2.07(b) shall cease. If the Borrower pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, the amount so paid shall constitute a repayment of such Borrowing by such amount. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower or any other Loan Party may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
 
Section 2.08.                          Type; Interest Elections.
 
(a)                                 Each Borrowing shall initially be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of any LIBO Rate Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a LIBO Rate Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.08. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders based upon their Applicable Percentages and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
 
(b)                                 To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.08, the Borrower shall (i) deliver an Interest Election Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower or (ii) provide irrevocable telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in writing by delivery of a written Interest Election Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower of the applicable election to the Administrative Agent).
 
(c)                                  Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
 
75





 
(i)                                     the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
 
(ii)                                  the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(iii)                               whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a LIBO Rate Borrowing; and
 
(iv)                              if the resulting Borrowing is a LIBO Rate Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period.
 
If any such Interest Election Request requests a LIBO Rate Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.
 
(d)                                 Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing.
 
(e)                                  If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a LIBO Rate Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, such Borrowing shall be converted at the end of such Interest Period to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a LIBO Rate Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each LIBO Rate Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the then-current Interest Period applicable thereto and provided that no such notice shall be required in the case of an Event of Default under Section 7.01(f) or Section 7.01(g).
 
Section 2.09.                          Termination and Reduction of Commitments.
 
(a)                                 Unless previously terminated, (i) the Initial Term Loan Commitments on the Closing Date shall automatically terminate upon the making of the Initial Term Loans on the Closing Date, (ii) the Initial Revolving Credit Commitments shall automatically terminate on the Initial Revolving Credit Maturity Date, (iii) the Additional Term Loan Commitments of any Class shall automatically terminate upon the making of the Additional Term Loans of such Class and, if any such Additional Term Loan Commitment is not drawn on the date that such Additional Term Loan Commitment is required to be drawn pursuant to the applicable Refinancing Amendment, Extension Amendment or Incremental Facility Amendment, the undrawn amount thereof shall automatically terminate and (iv) the Additional Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date specified therefor in the applicable Refinancing Amendment, Extension Amendment or Incremental Facility Amendment.
 
(b)                                 Upon delivery of the notice required by Section 2.09(c), the Borrower may at any time terminate or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class; provided that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of Revolving Loans, the
 
76





 
aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Exposures attributable to the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class would exceed the aggregate amount of Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class; provided that, after the establishment of any Additional Revolving Credit Commitments, any such termination or reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class shall be subject to the provisions set forth in Section 2.22, 2.23 or 9.02, as applicable.
 
(c)                                  The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce any Revolving Credit Commitment under paragraph (b) of this Section 2.09 in writing at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction (or such later date to which the Administrative Agent may agree), specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Revolving Lenders of each applicable Class of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.09 shall be irrevocable; provided that any such notice may state that it is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other transactions, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of any Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.09(c) shall be permanent. Upon any reduction of any Revolving Credit Commitment, the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Revolving Lender of the relevant Class shall be reduced by such Revolving Lenders Applicable Percentage of such reduction amount.

(a)                                 (i) The Borrower hereby unconditionally, jointly and severally, promises to repay the outstanding principal amount of the Initial Term Loans to the Administrative Agent for the accounts of the Initial Term Lenders:

(ii)                                  The Borrower shall repay the Additional Term Loans of any Class in such scheduled amortization installments and on such date or dates as shall be specified therefor in the applicable Refinancing Amendment, Incremental Facility Amendment or Extension Amendment (as such payments may be reduced from time to time as a result of the application of prepayments in accordance with Section 2.11 or repurchases in accordance with Section 9.05(g)).
 
(iii)                               Prior to any repayment of Term Loans of any Class under this Section 2.10(a), the Borrower may select the Term Loan Borrowing or Borrowings of the applicable Class to be repaid by notifying the Administrative Agent in writing of such selection (A) in the case of a repayment of any LIBO Rate Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m. three Business Days before the scheduled date of repayment and (B) in the case of a repayment of an ABR Borrowing,

Each repayment of any Term Loan Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.10(a) shall be applied ratably to the Term Loans included in such Term Loan Borrowing.
 
(b)                                 (i) The Borrower hereby unconditionally, jointly and severally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Initial Revolving Lender the then-unpaid principal amount of the Initial Revolving Loans of such Lender on the Initial Revolving Credit Maturity Date and (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Additional Revolving Lender the then-unpaid principal amount of each Additional Revolving Loan of such Additional Revolving Lender on the Maturity Date applicable thereto.
 
(ii)                                  On the Maturity Date applicable to the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class, the Borrower shall (A) cancel and return outstanding Letters of Credit (or alternatively, with respect to each outstanding Letter of Credit, furnish to the Administrative Agent) a Cash deposit (or if reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Issuing Bank, a backstop letter of credit) equal to 103.0% of the Stated Amount thereof (minus any amount then on deposit in any Cash collateral account established for the benefit of the relevant Issuing Bank) as of such date, in each case to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Exposure attributable to the Revolving Credit Commitments of any other Class shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Commitments of such other Class then in effect and (B) make payment in full in Cash of all accrued and unpaid fees and all reimbursable expenses and other Obligations with respect to the Revolving Facility of the applicable Class then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest (if any) thereon.
 
(c)                                  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver a Promissory Note to such Lender payable to such Lender and its registered assigns; it being understood and agreed that such Lender (or its applicable assign) shall be required to return such Promissory Note to the Borrower in accordance with Section 9.05(b)(iii) and upon the occurrence of the Termination Date (or as promptly thereafter as practicable). If any Lender loses the original copy of its Promissory Note, it shall execute an affidavit of loss containing an indemnification provision reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower.

(iii)                               In the event that the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary (x) receives Net Proceeds from the issuance or incurrence of (A) Indebtedness by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not permitted under Section 6.01, (B) Indebtedness that constitutes (I) Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 6.01(p), (II) Incremental Loans incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.22 or (III) Replacement Term Loans incurred to refinance all or any portion of the Term Loans in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.02(c), the Borrower shall, substantially simultaneously with (and in any event not later than the next succeeding Business Day) the receipt of such Net Proceeds by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, apply an amount equal to 100.0% of such Net Proceeds to prepay the outstanding

(B)                               if the Borrower determines in good faith that the distribution to the Borrower of the relevant Excess Cash Flow generated by any joint venture or the relevant Subject Proceeds received by any joint venture to prepay any amount of such Excess Cash Flow or Subject Proceeds that would otherwise be required to be paid pursuant to Sections 2.11(b)(i) or (ii) above would be prohibited under the Organizational Documents governing such joint venture (such amount, a Restricted Joint Venture Amount), the amount that the Borrower shall be required to mandatorily prepay pursuant to Sections 2.11(b)(i) or (ii) above, as applicable, shall be reduced by the Restricted Joint Venture Amount; it being understood that if the relevant prohibition ceases to exist within the 365-day period following the end of the applicable Excess Cash Flow Period or the event giving rise to the relevant Subject Proceeds, the relevant joint venture will promptly distribute to the Borrower to the extent then available the relevant Excess Cash Flow or the relevant Subject Proceeds, as the case may be, and such Excess Cash Flow or Subject Proceeds (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result of such distribution) will be applied promptly after such distribution to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.11(b) to the extent required herein (without regard to this clause (v)(B)),
 
82





 
(C)                               if the Borrower determines in good faith that the repatriation to the Borrower or any dividend or other distribution, as applicable, to the Borrower of any amounts required to mandatorily prepay the Term Loans pursuant to Sections 2.11(b)(i) or (ii) above would result in a material Tax liability (including any withholding Tax) (such amount, a Restricted Tax Amount), the amount that the Borrower shall be required to mandatorily prepay pursuant to Sections 2.11(b)(i) or (ii) above, as applicable, shall be reduced by the Restricted Tax Amount; provided that to the extent that within the 365-day period following the event giving rise to the relevant Subject Proceeds or the end of the applicable Excess Cash Flow Period, as the case may be, such repatriation or dividend or other distribution, as applicable, of the relevant Subject Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow to the Borrower would no longer result in a material Tax liability, to the extent then available the Subject Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow, as applicable, will be promptly repatriated or paid as a dividend or otherwise distributed to the Borrower and will be applied promptly thereafter (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result of such repatriation, dividend or other distribution, as applicable) to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.11(b) to the extent required herein (without regard to this clause (v)(C));
 
(vi)                              Any Term Lender may elect, by notice to the Administrative Agent at or prior to the time and in the manner specified by the Administrative Agent, prior to any prepayment of Term Loans required to be made by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.11(b), to decline all (but not a portion) of its Applicable Percentage of such prepayment (such declined amounts, the Declined Proceeds), in which case such Declined Proceeds shall be offered to prepay, on a pro rata basis, the Term Lenders that have not declined their Applicable Percentage of prepayment; provided that (A) in the event that any Term Lender elects to decline receipt of such Declined Proceeds, the remaining amount thereof may be retained by the Borrower and (B) for the avoidance of doubt, no Lender may reject any prepayment made under Section 2.11(b)(iii) to the extent that such prepayment is made with the Net Proceeds of (x) Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 6.01(p), (y) Incremental Loans incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.22 or (z) Replacement Term Loans incurred to refinance all or any portion of the Term Loans in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.02(c). If any Lender fails to deliver a notice to the Administrative Agent of its election to decline receipt of its Applicable Percentage of any mandatory prepayment within the time frame specified by the Administrative Agent, such failure will be deemed to constitute an acceptance of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the total amount of such mandatory prepayment of Term Loans.
 
(vii)                           Except as otherwise provided in any Refinancing Amendment, any Incremental Facility Amendment or any Extension Amendment, each prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.11(b) shall be applied ratably to each Class of Term Loans then outstanding (provided that any prepayment of Term Loans with the Net Proceeds of any Refinancing Indebtedness, Incremental Term Facility or Replacement Term Loans shall be applied to the applicable Class of Term Loans being refinanced or replaced). With respect to each Class of Term Loans, all accepted prepayments under this Section 2.11(b) shall be applied against the remaining scheduled installments of principal due in respect of such Term Loans as directed by the Borrower (or, in the absence of direction from the Borrower, to the remaining scheduled amortization payments in respect of such Term Loans in direct order of maturity), and each such prepayment shall be paid to the Term Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentage of the applicable Class. The amount of such mandatory prepayments shall be applied on a pro rata basis to the then outstanding Term Loans being prepaid irrespective of whether such outstanding Term Loans are ABR Loans or LIBO Rate Loans; provided that if no Lenders
 
83





 
exercise the right to waive a given mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(b)(vi), then, with respect to such mandatory prepayment, the amount of such mandatory prepayment shall be applied first to the then outstanding Term Loans that are ABR Loans and then to the then outstanding Term Loans that are LIBO Rate Loans in a manner that minimizes the amount of any payments required to be made by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.16.
 
(viii)                        (A) In the event that the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Class exceeds 100.0% of the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class then in effect, the Borrower shall, within five Business Days of receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent, prepay the Revolving Loans or reduce LC Exposure in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such Revolving Credit Exposure as of the date of such payment to an amount not to exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class then in effect by taking any of the following actions as it shall determine at its sole discretion: (x) prepaying Revolving Loans or (y) with respect to any excess LC Exposure, depositing Cash in a Cash collateral account established for the benefit of the relevant Issuing Bank or backstopping or replacement of the relevant Letters of Credit, in each case, in an amount equal to 103.0% of such excess LC Exposure attributable to the Stated Amount of such Letters of Credit (minus any amount then on deposit in any Cash collateral account established for the benefit of the relevant Issuing Bank).
 
(B)                               Each prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing under this Section 2.11(b)(viii) shall be paid to the Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages of the applicable Class.
 
(ix)                              Prepayments made under this Section 2.11(b) shall be (A) accompanied by accrued interest as required by Section 2.13, (B) subject to Section 2.16 and (C) in the case of prepayments of Initial Term Loans under clause (iii) above as part of a Repricing Transaction, subject to Section 2.12(e), but shall otherwise be without premium or penalty.
 
Section 2.12.                          Fees.
 
(a)                                 The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender of any Class (other than any Defaulting Lender) a commitment fee, which shall accrue at a rate equal to the Commitment Fee Rate applicable to the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class on the average daily amount of the unused Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class of such Revolving Lender during the period from and including the Closing Date to the date on which such Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class terminates. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December (commencing with the last Business Day of March 2018) for the quarterly period then ended, and on the date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments of the applicable Class terminate. For purposes of calculating the commitment fee only, the Revolving Credit Commitment of any Class of any Revolving Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of Revolving Loans of such Class of such Revolving Lender and the LC Exposure of such Revolving Lender attributable to its Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class.
 
(b)                                 The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Revolving Lender of any Class, a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Revolving Loans of such Class that are LIBO Rate Loans on the daily face amount of such Lenders LC Exposure attributable to its Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class (excluding any portion thereof that is attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements), during the period from and including the Closing Date to the earlier of (A) the later of the date on which such Revolving Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class terminates and the date on which such Revolving Lender ceases to have any
 
84





 
LC Exposure attributable to its Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class and (B) the Termination Date, (ii) to each Issuing Bank, a fronting fee, in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for the period from the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to the earlier of (A) the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, (B) the date on which such Letter of Credit terminates or (C) the Termination Date, computed at a rate equal to equal to 0.125% per annum or the rate agreed by such Issuing Bank and the Borrower, and (iii) to each Issuing Bank, for its own account, such Issuing Banks standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees shall accrue to but excluding the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and be payable in arrears for the quarterly period then ended on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December (commencing, if applicable, with the last Business Day of March 2018); provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments of the applicable Class terminate, and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments of the applicable Class terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within thirty days after receipt of a written demand (accompanied by reasonable back-up documentation) therefor.
 
(c)                                  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the annual administration fee in the amounts and at the times set forth in the Fee Letter.
 
(d)                                 Except as otherwise provided in the Fee Letter, all fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the applicable Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to any Issuing Bank). Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances except as otherwise provided in the Fee Letter.
 
(e)                                  In the event that, on or prior to the date that is six months following the Closing Date, (A) any Initial Term Loans are refinanced in a Repricing Transaction (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any prepayment made pursuant to Section 2.11(b)(iii) that constitutes a Repricing Transaction), or (B) any amendment, waiver or other modification of or to this Agreement is effected that constitutes a Repricing Transaction, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each of the applicable Initial Term Lenders, (I) in the case of clause (A), a premium of 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Term Loans so refinanced and (II) in the case of clause (B), a fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Term Loans that are the subject of such Repricing Transaction outstanding immediately prior to such Repricing Transaction. If, on or prior to the date that is six months following the Closing Date, all or any portion of the Initial Term Loans held by any Term Lender are prepaid or assigned at the election of the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19(b)(iv) as a result of such Term Lender being a Non-Consenting Lender in respect of any amendment, waiver or modification of or to this Agreement constituting a Repricing Transaction, the Borrower shall pay to such Term Lender a fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Term Loans held by such Term Lender that are so prepaid or assigned (it being expressly understood and agreed that such fee shall be paid in lieu of, and not in addition to, any amounts that would be payable in respect of such Initial Term Loans pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence). All such amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.12(e) shall be due and payable on the date of effectiveness of the applicable Repricing Transaction.
 
(f)                                   Unless otherwise indicated herein, all computations of fees shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and shall be payable for the actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Each determination by the Administrative Agent of a fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

Section 2.13.                          Interest.
 
(a)                                 The Term Loans and Revolving Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
 
(b)                                 The Term Loans and Revolving Loans comprising each LIBO Rate Borrowing shall bear interest at the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
 
(c)                                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default under Sections 7.01(a), 7.01(f) or 7.01(g) has occurred and is continuing, any principal of or interest on any Term Loan or Revolving Loan, any LC Disbursement or any fee payable by the Borrower hereunder that is not, in each case, paid or reimbursed when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, shall, to the extent of the relevant overdue amount, bear interest, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal or interest of any Term Loan, Revolving Loan or unreimbursed LC Disbursement, 2.00% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Term Loan, Revolving Loan or LC Disbursement as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 2.13 or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2.00% plus the rate applicable to Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.13; provided that no amount shall accrue pursuant to this Section 2.13(c) on any overdue amount payable to a Defaulting Lender during the period that such Lender is a Defaulting Lender.
 
(d)                                 Accrued interest on each Term Loan or Revolving Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Term Loan or Revolving Loan and (i) on the Maturity Date applicable to such Loan and (ii) in the case of a Revolving Loan of any Class, upon termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class; provided that (A) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Term Loan or Revolving Loan (other than any repayments or prepayments of an ABR Revolving Loan of any Class that are not made in connection with the termination or permanent reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (B) in the event of any conversion of any LIBO Rate Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Term Loan or Revolving Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
 
(e)                                  All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate that is determined by reference to the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day.
 
Section 2.14.                          Alternate Rate of Interest. If at least two Business Days prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBO Rate Borrowing:
 
(a)                                 the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
 
86





 
(b)                                 the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
 
then the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, which the Administrative Agent agrees promptly to do, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a LIBO Rate Borrowing shall be ineffective and such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a LIBO Rate Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.
 
Section 2.15.                          Increased Costs.
 
(a)                                 If any Change in Law:
 
(i)                                     imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the LIBO Rate) or Issuing Bank;
 
(ii)                                  subjects any Lender or Issuing Bank to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (e) of the definition of Excluded Taxes, (C) Connection Income Taxes, and (D) Other Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
 
(iii)                               imposes on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or LIBO Rate Loans made by any Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the relevant Lender of making or maintaining any LIBO Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of any LIBO Rate Loan or Letter of Credit in an amount deemed by such Lender or Issuing Bank to be material, then, within thirty days after the Borrowers receipt of the certificate contemplated by paragraph (c) of this Section 2.15, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided that the Borrower shall not be liable for such compensation (A) unless such Lender or Issuing Bank is generally charging such amounts to similarly situated borrowers under comparable syndicated credit facilities or (B) if (x) the relevant Change in Law occurs on a date prior to the date such Lender becomes a party hereto or (y) such Lender invokes Section 2.20.
 
(b)                                 If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding liquidity or capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or Issuing Banks capital or on the capital of such Lenders or Issuing Banks holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company could have
 
87





 
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or Issuing Banks policies and the policies of such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then within thirty days of receipt by the Borrower of the certificate contemplated by paragraph (c) of this Section 2.15 the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c)                                  Any Lender or Issuing Bank requesting compensation under this Section 2.15 shall be required to deliver a certificate to the Borrower that (i) sets forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or the holding company thereof, as applicable, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.15 and (ii) sets forth, in reasonable detail, the manner in which such amount or amounts were determined.
 
(d)                                 Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or Issuing Banks right to demand such compensation; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or Issuing Banks intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
 
Section 2.16.                          Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the conversion or prepayment of any principal of any LIBO Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration or otherwise), (b) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBO Rate Loan on the date or in the amount specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto or (c) the assignment of any LIBO Rate Loan of any Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense incurred by such Lender that is attributable to such event (other than loss of profit). In the case of a LIBO Rate Loan, the loss, cost or expense of any Lender shall be the amount reasonably determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the applicable currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the Eurodollar market; it being understood that such loss, cost or expense shall in any case exclude any interest rate floor and all administrative, processing or similar fees. Any Lender requesting compensation under this Section 2.16 shall be required to deliver a certificate to the Borrower that sets forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16, the basis therefor and, in reasonable detail, the manner in which such amount or amounts were determined, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within thirty days after receipt thereof.
 
Section 2.17.                          Taxes.
 
(a)                                 Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without withholding or
 
88





 
deduction for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Requirements of Law. If any applicable Requirement of Law requires the withholding or deduction of any Tax from any such payment, then (i) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax, the amount payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required withholdings and deductions (including withholdings and deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.17) the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank (as applicable) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholdings or deductions been made, (ii) the relevant Loan Party shall be entitled to make such withholdings or deductions and (iii) the relevant Loan Party shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law. If at any time any Loan Party is required by any applicable Requirement of Law to make any withholding or deduction from any amount payable hereunder or under any Loan Document, such Loan Party shall promptly notify the relevant Lender or Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent after any Responsible Officers receipt of written notice from a Governmental Authority of the same.
 
(b)                                 In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for any Other Taxes paid by it.
 
(c)                                  The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, as applicable within thirty days after receipt of the certificate described in the succeeding sentence, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes payable or paid by, or withheld or deducted from a payment to, the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto. In connection with any request for reimbursement under this Section 2.17(c), the relevant Lender, Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall deliver a schedule to the Borrower setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis and calculation of the amount of the relevant payment or liability, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(d)                                 Each Lender and each Issuing Bank shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within thirty days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (but only to the extent that no Loan Party has already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders or Issuing Banks failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.05(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender or Issuing Bank, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender or Issuing Bank by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender and Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or Issuing Bank under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to any Lender or Issuing Bank under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to any Lender or Issuing Bank from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (d).
 
(e)                                  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.17, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
89





 
(f)                                   Status of Lenders.
 
(i)                                     Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in clauses (ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below), shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
 
(ii)                                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
 
(A)                               each Lender that is not a Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), two executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
 
(B)                               each Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(1)                                 in the case of any Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;
 
(2)                                 executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
(3)                                 in the case of any Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section
 
90





 
881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or
 
 
(4)                                 to the extent any Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-2 or Exhibit L-4, IRS Form W-9, or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if such Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-3 on behalf of each such direct or indirect partner;
 
(C)                               each Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)                               if a payment made to any Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation as is prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall promptly update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. For purposes of this Section 2.17(f), the term Lender shall be deemed to include any Issuing Bank.
 
(g)                                  If the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Issuing Bank receives a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over
 
91





 
such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Loan Party under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the Administrative Agent, any Lender or Issuing Bank be required to pay any amount to the Borrower under this clause (g) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the relevant Loan Party or any other Person.
 
(h)                                 Survival. Each partys obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, any Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
 
Section 2.18.                          Payments Generally; Allocation of Proceeds; Sharing of Payments.
 
(a)                                 Unless otherwise specified, the Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, reimbursements of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) no later than 3:00 p.m. on the date when due in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable account designated by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Person or Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.19(b) and 2.20, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Loans of a given Class and each conversion of any Borrowing to or continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type (and of the same Class) shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages of the applicable Class. Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lenders portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lenders percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole Dollar amount. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.
 
(b)                                 All proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent while an Event of Default exists and all or any portion of the Loans that have been accelerated hereunder pursuant to Section 7.01, shall, upon election by the Administrative Agent or at the direction of the Required Lenders,
 
92





 
be applied, first, to the payment of all costs and expenses then due incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with any collection, sale or realization on Collateral or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the Secured Obligations, including all court costs and the fees and expenses of agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document on behalf of any Loan Party and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document, second, on a pro rata basis, to pay any fees, indemnities or expense reimbursements then due to the Administrative Agent (other than those covered in clause first above) or to any Issuing Bank constituting Secured Obligations, third, to pay interest, including any commission charges or fees with respect to letters of credit, due and payable in respect of any Loans on a pro rata basis, fourth, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the amounts of the other Secured Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no written claim has yet been made) owed to the Secured Parties on the date of any such distribution, to the payment in full of the Secured Obligations (including, with respect to LC Exposure, an amount to be paid to the Administrative Agent equal to 103.0% of the Stated Amount of any outstanding Letters of Credit (minus the amount then on deposit in the LC Collateral Account) on such date, to be held in the LC Collateral Account as Cash collateral for such Obligations); provided that if any Letter of Credit expires undrawn, then any Cash collateral held to secure the related LC Exposure shall be applied in accordance with this Section 2.18(b), beginning with clause first above, fifth, to, or at the direction of, the Borrower or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.
 
(c)                                  If any Lender obtains payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off or otherwise) in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans of any Class or participations in LC Disbursements held by it resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans of such Class and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender with Loans of such Class and participations in LC Disbursements, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for Cash at face value) participations in the Loans of such Class and sub-participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders of such Class at such time outstanding to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans of such Class and participations in LC Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by any Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any permitted assignee or participant, including any payment made or deemed made in connection with Sections 2.22, 2.23 and 9.02(c). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agree, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Requirements of Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.18(c) and will, in each case, notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.18(c) shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.
 
(d)                                 Unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender or any
 
93





 
Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lender or Issuing Bank the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
(e)                                  If any Lender fails to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.07(b) or Section 2.18(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
 
Section 2.19.                          Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
 
(a)                                 If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or any Lender determines it can no longer make or maintain LIBO Rate Loans pursuant to Section 2.20, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to or indemnify any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or its participation in any Letter of Credit affected by such event, or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as applicable, in the future or mitigate the impact of Section 2.20, as the case may be, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed out-of-pocket cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
(b)                                 If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, any Lender has declined or is unable to designate, or assign to, a different lending office, branch or affiliate pursuant to clause (a) above, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to or indemnify any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (iv) in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of each Lender, each Revolving Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby (or any other Class or group of Lenders other than the Required Lenders or Required Revolving Lenders) with respect to which Required Lender or Required Revolving Lender consent (or the consent of Lenders holding loans or commitments of such Class or lesser group representing more than 50.0% of the sum of the total loans and unused commitments of such Class or lesser group at such time) has been obtained, as applicable, any Lender is a non-consenting Lender (each such Lender, a Non-Consenting Lender), then the Borrower may, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, (x) terminate the applicable Commitments of such Lender, and repay all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such Lender relating to the applicable Loans and participations held by such Lender as of such termination date (provided that, if, after giving effect to such termination and repayment, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Class exceeds the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class then in effect, then the Borrower shall, not later than the next Business Day, prepay one or more Revolving Borrowings of the applicable Class (and, if no Revolving Borrowings of such Class are outstanding, deposit Cash collateral in the LC Collateral Account) in an amount necessary to eliminate such excess) or (y) replace such Lender by requiring such Lender to assign and delegate (and such Lender shall be
 
94





 
obligated to assign and delegate), without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.05), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which Eligible Assignee may be another Lender, if any Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (A) such Lender has received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of its Loans and, if applicable, funded participations in LC Disbursements, in each case of such Class of Loans or Commitments, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder with respect to such Class of Loans or Commitments, (B) in the case of any assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment would result in a reduction in such compensation or payments, (C) in the case of any assignment resulting from the inability or failure to designate, or assign to, a different lending office, branch or affiliate, such assignment is to a Lender that can make or maintain LIBO Rate Loans and (D) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Requirements of Law. No Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) shall be required to make any such assignment and delegation, and the Borrower may not repay the Obligations of such Lender or terminate its Commitments, if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each Lender agrees that if it is replaced pursuant to this Section 2.19, it shall (x) execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption to evidence such sale and purchase and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Promissory Note (if the assigning Lenders Loans are evidenced by one or more Promissory Notes) subject to such Assignment and Assumption (provided that the failure of any Lender replaced pursuant to this Section 2.19 to execute an Assignment and Assumption or deliver any such Promissory Note shall not render such sale and purchase (and the corresponding assignment) invalid), such assignment shall be recorded in the Register, any such Promissory Note shall be deemed cancelled, and (y) in the case of any Non-Consenting Lender who is the Lender of record for purposes of determining whether the applicable number of Lenders have consented to the relevant amendment, waiver or consent, consent to the relevant proposed amendment, waiver or consent prior to the execution of such Assignment and Assumption. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (such appointment being coupled with an interest) as such Lenders attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Lender and in the name of such Lender, from time to time in the Administrative Agents discretion, with prior written notice to such Lender, to take any action and to execute any such Assignment and Assumption or other instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this clause (b).
 
Section 2.20.                          Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Published LIBO Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Published LIBO Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of Dollars in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue LIBO Rate Loans or to convert ABR Loans to LIBO Rate Loans shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Published LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender, shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Published LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist (which notice such Lender agrees to give promptly). Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from the relevant Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or convert all of such Lenders LIBO Rate Loans to ABR Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the
 
95





 
Published LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate) either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBO Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBO Rate Loans (in which case the Borrower shall not be required to make payments pursuant to Section 2.16 in connection with such payment) and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Published LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Alternate Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Published LIBO Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Published LIBO Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the determination of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
 
Section 2.21.                          Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then unless and until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
 
(a)                                 Fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of any Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and, subject to clause (d)(iv) below, on the participation of such Defaulting Lender in Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 2.12(b).
 
(b)                                 The Commitments and the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders, each affected Lender, the Required Lenders, the Required Revolving Lenders or such other number of Lenders as may be required hereby or under any other Loan Document have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any waiver, amendment or modification pursuant to Section 9.02); provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender disproportionately and adversely relative to other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.
 
(c)                                  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of any Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 2.11, Section 2.15, Section 2.16, Section 2.17, Section 2.18, Article 7, Section 9.05 or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.09), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent and, where relevant, the Borrower as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any applicable Issuing Bank hereunder; third, if so reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent or reasonably requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, to be held as Cash collateral for future funding obligations of such Defaulting Lender in respect of any participation in any Letter of Credit; fourth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, as the Borrower may request, to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement; fifth, as the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may elect, to be held in a deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the non-Defaulting Lenders or Issuing Banks as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any non-Defaulting Lender, any Issuing Bank against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such
 
96





 
Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Exposure in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loan or LC Exposure was made or created, as applicable, at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LC Exposure owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LC Exposure owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and LC Exposure are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Revolving Credit Commitments within giving effect to Section 2.21(d). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to any Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by any Defaulting Lender or to post Cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.21(c) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 
(d)                                 If any LC Exposure exists at the time any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
 
(i)                                     the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Revolving Credit Percentages but only to the extent that (A) the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures of all non-Defaulting Lenders attributable to the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class does not exceed the total of the Revolving Credit Commitments of all non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders of such Class and (B) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any non-Defaulting Lender that is attributable to its Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class does not exceed such non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class;
 
(ii)                                  if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Requirements of Law, within three Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent, Cash collateralize 103.0% of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure attributable to the Stated Amount of outstanding Letters of Credit (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to paragraph (i) above and any Cash collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender or pursuant to Section 2.21(c)) or make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and to the applicable Issuing Bank with respect to such LC Exposure and obligations to fund participations. Cash collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce LC Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (A) the elimination of the applicable LC Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of the Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 2.19)) or (B) the Administrative Agents good faith determination that there exists excess Cash collateral (including as a result of any subsequent reallocation of LC Exposure among non-Defaulting Lenders described in clause (i) above);
 
(iii)                               if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.21(d), then the fees payable to the Revolving Lenders pursuant to Sections 2.12(a) and (b), as the case may be, shall be adjusted to give effect to such reallocation; and
 
(iv)                              if any Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is not Cash collateralized, prepaid or reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.21(d), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the applicable Issuing Bank or any Revolving Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure shall
 
97





 
be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is Cash collateralized or reallocated.
 
(e)                                  So long as any Revolving Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, extend, create, incur, amend or increase any Letter of Credit unless the entire Stated Amount thereof will be covered by the Revolving Credit Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders, Cash collateral provided pursuant to Section 2.21(c) or Cash collateral provided in accordance with Section 2.21(d), and participating interests in any such or newly issued, extended or created Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.21(d)(i) (it being understood that Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein).
 
(f)                                   In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each Issuing Bank agree that any Defaulting Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will notify the other parties hereto, and then, on the effective date specified in such notice, and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash collateral) the Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of LC Exposure of the Revolving Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment, and on such date, to the extent applicable such Revolving Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the applicable Class of the other Revolving Lenders or participations in Letters of Credit or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent determine as necessary in order for such Revolving Lender to hold such Revolving Loans or participations in accordance with its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Class or its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage, as applicable. Notwithstanding the fact that any Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, (x) no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender and (y) except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.

(vi)                              (A) the final maturity date with respect to any Incremental Term Loans shall be no earlier than the Latest Term Loan Maturity Date and (B) no Incremental Revolving Facility may have a final maturity date earlier than (or require scheduled amortization or mandatory commitment reductions prior to) the Latest Revolving Credit Matur

(xi)                              the proceeds of any Incremental Facility may be used by the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries for working capital and other general corporate purposes (including the financing of acquisitions and other Investments and Restricted Payments) and any other use not prohibited by this Agreement, and
 
(xii)                           on the date of the Borrowing of any Incremental Term Loans that will be of the same Class as any then-existing Class of Term Loans, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Sections 2.08 or 2.13, such Incremental Term Loans shall be added to (and constitute a part of, be of the same Type as and, at the election of the Borrower, have the same Interest Period as) each Borrowing of outstanding Term Loans of such Class on a pro rata basis (based on the relative sizes of such Borrowings), so that each Term Lender providing such Incremental Term Loans will participate proportionately in each then-outstanding Borrowing of Term Loans of such Class; it being acknowledged that the application of this clause (a)(xii) may result in new Incremental Term Loans having Interest Periods (the duration of which may be less
 
100





 
than one month) that begin during an Interest Period then applicable to outstanding LIBO Rate Loans of the relevant Class and which end on the last day of such Interest Period.
 
(b)                                 Incremental Commitments may be provided by any existing Lender, or by any other Eligible Assignee (other than any Disqualified Institution) (any such other lender being called an Additional Lender); provided that the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of any Incremental Revolving Facility, any Issuing Bank) shall have a right to consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the relevant Additional Lenders provision of Incremental Commitments if such consent would be required under Section 9.05(b) for an assignment of Loans to such Additional Lender; provided, further, that any Additional Lender that is an Affiliated Lender shall be subject to the provisions of Section 9.05(g), mutatis mutandis, to the same extent as if Incremental Commitments and related Obligations had been obtained by such Lender by way of assignment.
 
(c)                                  Each Lender or Additional Lender providing a portion of any Incremental Commitment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower all such documentation (including the relevant Incremental Facility Amendment) as may be reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to evidence and effectuate such Incremental Commitment.

(B)                               to the extent applicable, certifying that the condition set forth in clause (a)(x) above has been satisfied.
 
(e)                                  Upon the implementation of any Incremental Revolving Facility pursuant to this Section 2.22:
 
(i)                                     if such Incremental Revolving Facility establishes Revolving Credit Commitments of the same Class as any then-existing Class of Revolving Credit Commitments, (i) each Revolving Lender immediately prior to such increase will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assigned to each relevant Incremental Revolving Facility Lender, and each relevant Incremental Revolving Facility Lender will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assumed a portion of such Revolving Lenders participations hereunder in outstanding Letters of Credit such that, after giving effect to each deemed assignment and assumption of participations, all of the Revolving Lenders (including each Incremental Revolving Facility Lender) participations hereunder in Letters of Credit shall be held on a pro rata basis on the basis of their respective Revolving Credit Commitments (after giving effect to
 
101





 
any increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to Section 2.22) and (ii) the existing Revolving Lenders of the applicable Class shall assign Revolving Loans to certain other Revolving Lenders of such Class (including the Revolving Lenders providing the relevant Incremental Revolving Facility), and such other Revolving Lenders (including the Revolving Lenders providing the relevant Incremental Revolving Facility) shall purchase such Revolving Loans, in each case to the extent necessary so that all of the Revolving Lenders of such Class participate in each outstanding Borrowing of Revolving Loans pro rata on the basis of their respective Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class (after giving effect to any increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.22); it being understood and agreed that the minimum borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to this clause (i); and
 
(ii)                                  if such Incremental Revolving Facility establishes Revolving Credit Commitments of a new Class, then (A) the borrowing and repayment (except for (x) payments of interest and fees at different rates on the Revolving Facilities (and related outstandings), (y) repayments required on the Maturity Date of any Revolving Facility and (z) any repayment made in connection with a permanent repayment and termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments under any Revolving Facility (subject to clause (C) below)) of Revolving Loans with respect to any Revolving Facility after the effective date of such Incremental Revolving Facility shall be made on a pro rata basis with all other Revolving Facilities, (B) all Letters of Credit shall be participated on a pro rata basis or less than pro rata basis by all Revolving Lenders and (C) any permanent repayment of Revolving Loans with respect to, and reduction and termination of Revolving Credit Commitments under, any Revolving Facility after the effective date of such Incremental Revolving Facility shall be made on a pro rata basis or less than pro rata basis with all other Revolving Facilities, except that the Borrower shall be permitted to permanently repay Revolving Loans and reduce or terminate Revolving Credit Commitments under any Revolving Facility on a greater than pro rata basis as compared to any other Revolving Facilities with a later Maturity Date than such Revolving Facility.
 
(f)                                   On the date of effectiveness of any Incremental Revolving Facility, the maximum amount of LC Exposure permitted hereunder shall increase by an amount, if any, agreed upon by Administrative Agent, the relevant Issuing Banks and the Borrower.
 
(g)                                  The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any Incremental Facility Amendment or any amendment to any other Loan Document as may be necessary in order to establish new Classes or sub-Classes in respect of Loans or commitments pursuant to this Section 2.22 and such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new Classes or sub-Classes, in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.22.
 
(h)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.22 or in any other provision of any Loan Document, if the proceeds of any Incremental Facility are intended to be applied to finance an acquisition or other Investment that is permitted under this Agreement, the conditions to entering into and availability of such Incremental Facility (including applicability of customary SunGard or other certain funds conditionality), and the timing of satisfaction or waiver of any such conditions (as between being satisfied or waived upon execution of an amendment evidencing such Incremental Facility or upon the making of any Incremental Loans thereunder), shall be as agreed to among the Borrower and the lenders in respect of such Incremental Facility but without in any way limiting the other applicable conditions to Incremental Facilities specified in this Section 2.22; provided that no Event of Default under
 
102





 
Sections 7.01(a), 7.01(f) or 7.01(g) exists or would exist immediately after giving effect to such Incremental Facility.
 
(i)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.22 or in any other provision of any Loan Document, the Loan Parties shall not be required to bring down any representations and warranties in connection with any Incremental Facility (other than with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.12, which such representations and warranties, shall be required to be true and correct, as of the applicable date of funding of such Incremental Facility and after giving effect to such Incremental Facility), unless and solely to the extent otherwise required by, the lender or lenders providing such Incremental Facility.
 
(j)            This Section 2.22 shall supersede any provision in Section 2.18 or 9.02 to the contrary.
 
Section 2.23.         Extensions of Loans and Revolving Credit Commitments.

(i)            except as to (A) interest rates, fees and final maturity (which shall, subject to immediately succeeding clause (iii), be determined by the Borrower and any Lender who agrees to an Extension of its Revolving Credit Commitments and set forth in the relevant Extension Offer) and (B) any covenants or other provisions applicable only to periods after the Latest Maturity Date of the tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments subject to such Extension Offer, the Revolving Credit Commitment of any Lender who agrees to an extension with respect to such Commitment (an Extended Revolving Credit Commitment; and the Loans thereunder, Extended Revolving Loans), and the related outstandings, shall constitute a revolving commitment (or related outstandings, as the case may be) with terms substantially identical to (or terms not less favorable to existing Lenders as) the tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments subject to the relevant Extension Offer (and related outstandings) provided hereunder; provided that to the extent more than one Revolving Facility exists after giving effect to any such Extension, (x) the borrowing and repayment (except for (1) payments of interest and fees at different rates on the Revolving Facilities (and related outstandings), (2) repayments required upon the Maturity Date of any Revolving Facility and (3) repayments made in connection with a permanent repayment and termination of Revolving Credit Commitments under any Revolving Facility (subject to clause (z) below)) of Revolving Loans with respect to any Revolving Facility after the effective date of such Extended Revolving Credit Commitments shall be made on a pro
 
103





 
rata basis or less than pro rata basis with all other Revolving Facilities, (y) all Letters of Credit shall be participated on a pro rata basis by all Revolving Lenders and (z) the permanent repayment of Revolving Loans with respect to, and reduction or termination of Revolving Credit Commitments under, any Revolving Facility after the effective date of such Extended Revolving Credit Commitments shall be made on a pro rata basis with all other Revolving Facilities, except that the Borrower shall be permitted to permanently repay Revolving Loans and terminate Revolving Credit Commitments of any Revolving Facility on a greater than pro rata basis as compared to any other Revolving Facilities with a later Maturity Date than such Revolving Facility;
 
(ii)           except as to (A) interest rates, fees, amortization, final maturity date, premiums, required prepayment dates and participation in prepayments (which shall, subject to immediately succeeding clauses (iii), (iv) and (v), be determined by the Borrower and any Lender who agrees to an Extension of its Term Loans and set forth in the relevant Extension Offer) and (B) any covenants or other provisions applicable only to periods after the Latest Maturity Date of the tranche of Term Loans subject to such Extension Offer (in each case, as of the date of such Extension), the Term Loans of any Lender extended pursuant to any Extension (any such extended Term Loans, the Extended Term Loans) shall have the same terms (or terms not less favorable to existing Lenders) as the tranche of Term Loans subject to the relevant Extension Offer; provided, however, that any representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants (including financial covenants) and events of default applicable to such tranche of Extended Term Loans that also expressly apply to (and for the benefit of) the tranche of Term Loans subject to the Extension Offer and each other Class of Term Loans hereunder may be more favorable to the lenders of the applicable tranche of Extended Term Loans than those originally applicable to the tranche of Term Loans subject to the Extension Offer;
 
(iii)          (x) the final Maturity Date of any Extended Term Loans may be no earlier than the Latest Maturity Date of the tranche of Term Loans subject to such Extension Offer (as of the date of such Extension) and (y) no Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or Extended Revolving Loans may have a final Maturity Date earlier than (or have scheduled commitment reductions prior to) the Latest Maturity Date of the tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments subject to such Extension Offer (as of the date of such Extension);
 
(iv)          the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Extended Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the tranche of Term Loans subject to such Extension Offer (as of the date of such Extension);
 
(v)           any Extended Term Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not greater than a pro rata basis) in any voluntary or mandatory repayments or prepayments (but, for purposes of clarity, not scheduled amortization payments) in respect of the Term Loans, in each case as specified in the relevant Extension Offer;
 
(vi)          if the aggregate principal amount of Loans or Commitments, as the case may be, in respect of which Lenders have accepted the relevant Extension Offer exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of Loans or Commitments, as the case may be, offered to be extended by the Borrower pursuant to such Extension Offer, then the Loans or Commitments, as the case may be, of such Lenders shall be extended ratably up to such maximum amount based on the respective principal amounts (but not to exceed the applicable Lenders actual holdings of record) with respect to which such Lenders have accepted such Extension Offer;
 
104





 
(vii)         unless the Administrative Agent otherwise agrees, any Extension shall be in a minimum amount of $1,000,000;
 
(viii)        any applicable Minimum Extension Condition must be satisfied or waived by the Borrower;
 
(ix)          any documentation in respect of any Extension shall be consistent with the foregoing; and
 
(x)           no Extension of any Revolving Facility shall be effective as to the obligations of any Issuing Bank with respect to Letters of Credit without the consent of such Issuing Bank (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (and, in the absence of such consent, all references herein to Latest Revolving Credit Maturity Date shall be determined, when used in reference to such Issuing Bank without giving effect to such Extension).
 
(b)           (i) No Extension consummated in reliance on this Section 2.23 shall constitute a voluntary or mandatory prepayment for purposes of Section 2.11, (ii) the scheduled amortization payments (insofar as such schedule affects payments due to Lenders participating in the relevant Class) set forth in Section 2.10 shall be adjusted to give effect to any Extension of any Class of Loans or Commitments and (iii) except as set forth in clause (a)(vii) above, no Extension Offer is required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum increment; provided that the Borrower may, in its sole discretion, specify as a condition (a Minimum Extension Condition) to the consummation of any Extension that a minimum amount (to be specified in the relevant Extension Offer in the Borrowers sole discretion) of Loans or Commitments (as applicable) of any or all applicable tranches be tendered; it being understood that the Borrower may, in its sole discretion, waive any such Minimum Extension Condition. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby consent to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.23 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the payment of any interest, fees or premium in respect of any Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Credit Commitments on such terms as may be set forth in the relevant Extension Offer) and hereby waive the requirements of any provision of this Agreement (including Sections 2.10, 2.11 or 2.18) or any other Loan Document that may otherwise prohibit any such Extension or any other transaction contemplated by this Section 2.23.
 
(c)           Subject to any consent required under Section 2.23(a)(x), no consent of any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall be required to effectuate any Extension, other than the consent of each Lender agreeing to such Extension with respect to one or more of its Loans or Commitments of any Class (or a portion thereof). All Extended Term Loans and Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and all obligations in respect thereof shall constitute Secured Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that are secured by the Collateral and guaranteed on a pari passu basis with all other applicable Secured Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any Extension Amendment and any amendment to any of the other Loan Documents with the Loan Parties as may be necessary in order to establish new Classes or sub-Classes in respect of Loans or Commitments so extended and such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new Classes or sub-Classes, in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.23.
 
(d)           In connection with any Extension, the Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent at least five Business Days (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior written notice thereof, and shall agree to such procedures (including regarding timing, rounding and other adjustments and to ensure reasonable administrative management of the credit facilities hereunder
 
105





 
after such Extension), if any, as may be established by, or acceptable to, the Administrative Agent, in each case acting reasonably to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.23.

Lender (or any of their respective representatives) is prohibited by applicable Requirements of Law, (c) that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege or constitutes attorney work product or (d) in respect of which the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary owes confidentiality obligations to any third party (to the extent not created in contemplation of such Persons obligations under this Section 5.01(j)).
 
Documents required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 5.01 may be delivered electronically and if so delivered, shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date (i) on which the Borrower (or a representative thereof) posts such documents (or provides a link thereto) at the website address listed on Schedule 9.01; (ii) on which such documents are delivered by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for posting on behalf of the Borrower on IntraLinks/SyndTrak or another relevant secure website, if any, to which each Lender and the Administrative Agent have access (whether a commercial, third-party website or whether sponsored by the Administrative Agent); (iii) on which such documents are faxed to the Administrative Agent (or electronically mailed to an address provided by the Administrative Agent); or (iv) on which such items have been made available on the SEC website or the website of the relevant analogous governmental or private regulatory authority or securities exchange (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by way of EDGAR).

116





 
Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand, which consolidating information shall be certified by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower as having been fairly presented in all material respects and (ii) to the extent such financial statements are in lieu of financial statements required to be provided under Section 5.01(b), such financial statements shall be accompanied by a report and opinion of an independent registered public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing, which report and opinion shall satisfy the applicable requirements set forth in Section 5.01(b) as if the references to the Borrower therein were references to such Parent Company.

ARTICLE 8          THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
 
Section 8.01.         General Agency Provisions.
 
Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints Royal Bank (or any successor appointed pursuant hereto) to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf, including execution of the other Loan Documents, and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks (except as expressly set forth in this Article 8 with respect to consultation rights in connection with the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent), and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.
 
Any Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, unless the context otherwise requires or unless such Person is in fact not a Lender or an Issuing Bank, include each Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of any Loan Party or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Administrative Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to provide such information to them. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Administrative Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates
 
149





 
(including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to provide such information to them.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default exists, and the use of the term agent herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Requirements of Law; it being understood that such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary power, except discretionary rights and powers that are expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents and which the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders or Required Revolving Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the relevant circumstances as provided in Section 9.02); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Requirements of Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or Required Revolving Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as is necessary, or as the Administrative Agent believes in good faith shall be necessary, under the relevant circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or any Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection with any Loan Document, (iii) the performance or observance of any covenant, agreement or other term or condition set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien on the Collateral or the existence, value or sufficiency of the Collateral, (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent, (vii) any property, book or record of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof or (viii) the compliance or non-compliance by Affiliated Lenders with the terms hereof related to Affiliated Lenders.
 
If any Lender obtains knowledge of a Default or Event of Default, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders thereof in writing. Each Lender agrees that, except with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, it will not take any enforcement action hereunder or under any other Loan Document, accelerate the Obligations under any Loan Document, or exercise any right that it might otherwise have under applicable Requirements of Law or otherwise to credit bid at any
 
150





 
foreclosure sale, UCC sale, any sale under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other similar Disposition of Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender may take action to preserve or enforce its rights against a Loan Party where a deadline or limitation period is applicable that would, absent such action, bar enforcement of the Obligations held by such Lender, including the filing of a proof of claim in a case under the Bankruptcy Code.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, the Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Restricted Subsidiaries), the Administrative Agent and each Secured Party agree that (i) no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Loan Guaranty; it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof, and all powers, rights and remedies under the other Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent, and (ii) in the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or in the event of any other Disposition (including pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code), (A) the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties, shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale, to use and apply all or any portion of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by the Administrative Agent at such Disposition and (B) the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of all or any portion of such Collateral at any such Disposition.
 
No holder of any Secured Hedging Obligation or Banking Services Obligation in its respective capacity as such shall have any rights in connection with the management or release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Loan Party under this Agreement.
 
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorizes (and by entering into a Hedge Agreement with respect to any Secured Hedging Obligation or by entering into documentation in connection with any Banking Services Obligation, each of the other Secured Parties hereby authorizes and shall be deemed to authorize) the Administrative Agent, on behalf of all Secured Parties to take any of the following actions upon the instruction of the Required Lenders:
 
(a)           consent to the Disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral free and clear of the Liens securing the Secured Obligations in connection with any Disposition pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including Section 363 thereof;
 
(b)           credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations, or purchase all or any portion of the Collateral (in each case, either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles), in connection with any Disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Section 363 thereof;
 
(c)           credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations, or purchase all or any portion of the Collateral (in each case, either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles), in connection with any Disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral pursuant to the applicable provisions of the UCC, including pursuant to Sections 9-610 or 9-620 of the UCC;
 
(d)           credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations, or purchase all or any portion of the Collateral (in each case, either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles), in connection with any foreclosure or other Disposition conducted in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law following the occurrence of an Event of Default, including by power of sale, judicial action or otherwise; or
 
151





 
(e)                                  estimate the amount of any contingent or unliquidated Secured Obligations of such Lender or other Secured Party;
 
it being understood that no Lender shall be required to fund any amount in connection with any purchase of all or any portion of the Collateral by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the foregoing clauses (b), (c) or (d) without its prior written consent.
 
Each Secured Party agrees that the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to credit bid any part of the Secured Obligations or to purchase or retain or acquire any portion of the Collateral; provided that, in connection with any credit bid or purchase described under clauses (b), (c) or (d) of the preceding paragraph, the Secured Obligations owed to all of the Secured Parties (other than with respect to contingent or unliquidated liabilities as set forth in the next succeeding paragraph) may be, and shall be, credit bid by the Administrative Agent on a ratable basis.
 
With respect to any contingent or unliquidated claim that is a Secured Obligation, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, but is not required, to estimate the amount thereof for purposes of any credit bid or purchase described in the second preceding paragraph. In the event that the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, elects not to estimate any such contingent or unliquidated claim or any such claim cannot be estimated without unduly delaying the ability of the Administrative Agent to consummate any credit bid or purchase in accordance with the second preceding paragraph, then any contingent or unliquidated claims not so estimated shall be disregarded, shall not be credit bid, and shall not be entitled to any interest in the portion or the entirety of the Collateral purchased by means of such credit bid.
 
Each Secured Party whose Secured Obligations are credit bid under clauses (b), (c) or (d) of the third preceding paragraph is entitled to receive interests in the Collateral or any other asset acquired in connection with such credit bid (or in the Capital Stock of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such acquisition) on a ratable basis in accordance with the percentage obtained by dividing (x) the amount of the Secured Obligations of such Secured Party that were credit bid in such credit bid or other Disposition, by (y) the aggregate amount of all Secured Obligations that were credit bid in such credit bid or other Disposition.
 
In addition, in case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, each Secured Party agrees that the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or LC Disbursement is then due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent has made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
 
(i)                                     to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans or LC Disbursements and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts to the extent due to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.12 and 9.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
 
(ii)                                  to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same.
 
152





 
Any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and each Issuing Bank to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent consents to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amount due to the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.12 and 9.03.
 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or any Issuing Bank any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or any Issuing Bank or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or any Issuing Bank in any such proceeding.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) that it believes to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent has received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers under any Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of their respective duties and exercise their respective rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
 
The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving ten days written notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender (by reason of its insolvency) or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender (by reason of such Defaulting Lenders insolvency), either the Required Lenders or the Borrower may, upon ten days notice, remove the Administrative Agent. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation or delivery of any such notice of removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a commercial bank or trust company with offices in the U.S. having combined capital and surplus in excess of $1,000,000,000; provided that during the existence and continuation of an Event of Default under Section 7.01(a), Section 7.01(f) or Section 7.01(g), no consent of the Borrower shall be required. If
 
153





 
no successor has been appointed as provided above and accepted such appointment within ten days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation or the Administrative Agent receives notice of removal, then (a) in the case of a retirement, the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the consent of the Borrower, if applicable) or (b) in the case of a removal, the Borrower may, after consulting with the Required Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that (x) in the case of a retirement, if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment or (y) in the case of a removal, the Borrower notifies the Required Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then, in each case, such resignation or removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent in its capacity as collateral agent for the Secured Parties for purposes of maintaining the perfection of the Lien on the Collateral securing the Secured Obligations, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations required to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and each Issuing Bank directly (and each Lender and each Issuing Bank will cooperate with the Borrower to enable the Borrower to take such actions), until such time as the Required Lenders or the Borrower, as applicable, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, as provided above in this Article 8. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder as a successor Administrative Agent, the successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (other than its obligations under Section 9.13 hereof). The fees payable by the Borrower to any successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor Administrative Agent; for the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall have no obligation to pay any fee to any successor Administrative Agent that is greater than or in addition to the fees payable to the Administrative Agent on the Closing Date. After the Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the relevant Person was acting as Administrative Agent (including for this purpose holding any collateral security following the retirement or removal of the Administrative Agent). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Disqualified Institution (nor any Affiliate thereof) may be appointed as a successor Administrative Agent.
 
Any resignation by Royal Bank as Administrative Agent pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 8.01 shall also constitute its resignation as an Issuing Bank, unless it remains a Lender; provided that, if Royal Bank does not remain a Lender (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of Royal Bank as retiring Issuing Bank and (ii) Royal Bank shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents as an Issuing Bank except with respect to Letters of Credit previously issued by it.
 
Each Lender and each Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their
 
154





 
respective Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks by the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender or any Issuing Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the Arrangers or the Syndication Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement, except in their respective capacities as the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender hereunder, as applicable.
 
Each Secured Party irrevocably authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent to, and the Administrative Agent shall:
 
(a)                                 release any Lien on any property granted to or held by Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon the occurrence of the Termination Date, (ii) that is sold or to be sold or transferred as part of or in connection with any Disposition permitted under the Loan Documents to a Person that is not a Loan Party, (iii) that does not constitute (or ceases to constitute) Collateral as a result of a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents, (iv) if the property subject to such Lien is owned by a Loan Guarantor, upon the release of such Loan Guarantor from its Loan Guaranty otherwise in accordance with the Loan Documents, (v) as required under clause (d) below or (vi) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders in accordance with Section 9.02;
 
(b)                                 subject to Section 9.21, release any Loan Guarantor from its obligations under the Loan Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary (or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary), in each case, as a result of a single transaction or series of related transactions permitted hereunder;
 
(c)                                  subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Sections 6.02(d), 6.02(e), 6.02(g), 6.02(l), 6.02(m), 6.02(n), 6.02(o), 6.02(q), 6.02(r), 6.02(x), 6.02(y), 6.02(z)(i), 6.02(bb), 6.02(cc), 6.02(dd), 6.02(ee), 6.02(ff), 6.02(gg) and 6.02(hh) (and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any thereof to the extent such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be secured under Section 6.02(k)); and
 
(d)                                 enter into subordination, intercreditor or similar agreements with respect to Indebtedness that is (i) required or permitted to be subordinated hereunder or (ii) secured by Liens, and with respect to which Indebtedness, this Agreement contemplates an intercreditor, subordination, collateral trust agreement or similar agreement.
 
Upon the request of the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agents authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Loan Party from its obligations under the Loan Guaranty or its Lien on any Collateral pursuant to this Article 8. In each case as specified in this Article 8, the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender, and each Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrowers expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and
 
155





 
security interest granted under the Collateral Documents or to subordinate its interest therein, or to release such Loan Party from its obligations under the Loan Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Article 8. In connection with any such release or subordination of the Liens, the Borrower shall deliver a certificate of a Responsible Officer to the Administrative Agent requesting such release and/or subordination and certifying that such release and/or subordination, and any Liens incurred in connection therewith, and the Administrative Agent may rely exclusively upon such certificate as to whether such release and/or subordination and any such other Liens are permitted.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Administrative Agents Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.
 
The Administrative Agent is authorized to enter into any intercreditor, subordination, collateral trust or similar agreement (including any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement) contemplated hereby with respect to any Indebtedness (a) that is (i) required or permitted to be subordinated hereunder or (ii) secured by Liens and (b) which contemplates an intercreditor, subordination or collateral trust agreement (any such other intercreditor, subordination, collateral trust or similar agreement, an Additional Agreement), and the Secured Parties party hereto acknowledge that any Additional Agreement is binding upon them. Each Secured Party party hereto hereby (a) agrees that they will be bound by, and will not take any action contrary to, the provisions of any Additional Agreement and (b) authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent to enter into each Additional Agreement and to subject the Liens on the Collateral securing the Secured Obligations to the provisions thereof. The foregoing provisions are intended as an inducement to the Secured Parties to extend credit to the Borrower, and the Secured Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of such provisions and the provisions of each Additional Agreement.
 
To the extent that the Administrative Agent (or any Affiliate thereof) is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrower, the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any Affiliate thereof) in proportion to their respective Applicable Percentages (determined as if there were no Defaulting Lenders) for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent (or any Affiliate thereof) in performing its duties hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agents (or such affiliates) gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

Section 9.02.                          Waivers; Amendments.
 
(a)                                 No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under any other Loan Document are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any party hereto therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same is permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 9.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, neither the making of any
 
160





 
Loan nor the issuance of any Letter of Credit shall be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time.
 
(b)           Subject to clauses (A) through (E) of this Section 9.02(b) and Sections 9.02(c) and (d) below, neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified, except (i) in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) or (ii) in the case of any other Loan Document (other than any waiver, amendment or modification to effectuate any modification thereto expressly contemplated by the terms of such other Loan Document), pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Required Lenders) and each Loan Party that is party thereto; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing:
 
(A)          the consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (but not the consent of the Required Lenders) shall be required for any waiver, amendment or modification that:
 
(1)           increases the Commitment of such Lender (other than with respect to any Incremental Facility pursuant to Section 2.22 in respect of which such Lender has agreed to be an Additional Lender); it being understood that no amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any condition precedent, representation, warranty, covenant, Default, Event of Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of the Commitments shall constitute an increase of any Commitment of such Lender;
 
(2)           reduces or forgives the principal amount of any Loan owed to such Lender or any amount due to such Lender on any Loan Installment Date;
 
(3)           (x) extends the scheduled final maturity of any Loan or (y) postpones any Loan Installment Date or any Interest Payment Date with respect to any Loan held by such Lender or the date of any scheduled payment of any fee or premium payable to such Lender hereunder;
 
(4)           reduces the rate of interest (other than to (x) waive any Default or Event of Default or obligation of the Borrower to pay interest to such Lender at the default rate of interest under Section 2.13(c) or (y) extend the time for delivery of financials and/or any compliance certificate under Section 5.01, which, in each case, shall only require the consent of the Required Lenders) or the amount of any fee or premium owed to such Lender;
 
(5)           extends the expiry date of such Lenders Commitment; it being understood that no amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any condition precedent, representation, warranty, covenant, Default, Event of Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of any Commitment shall constitute an extension of any Commitment of any Lender; and
 
(6)           waives, amends or modifies the provisions of Sections 2.18(b) or 2.18(c) of this Agreement in a manner that would by its terms
 
161





 
alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby (except in connection with any transaction permitted under Sections 2.22, 2.23, 9.02(c) or 9.05(g) or as otherwise provided in this Agreement);
 
(B)          no such agreement shall:
 
(1)           change (x) any of the provisions of Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.02(b) or the definition of Required Lenders to reduce any voting percentage required to waive, amend or modify any right thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the prior written consent of each Lender or (y) the definition of Required Revolving Lenders without the prior written consent of each Revolving Lender (it being understood that neither the consent of the Required Lenders nor the consent of any other Lender shall be required in connection with any change to the definition of Required Revolving Lenders);
 
(2)           release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Lien granted pursuant to the Loan Documents (except as otherwise permitted herein or in the other Loan Documents, including pursuant to Article 8 or Section 9.21 hereof), without the prior written consent of each Lender; or
 
(3)           release all or substantially all of the value of the Guarantees under the Loan Guaranty (except as otherwise permitted herein or in the other Loan Documents, including pursuant to Section 9.21 hereof), without the prior written consent of each Lender;
 
(C)          solely with the consent of the Required Revolving Lenders (but without the consent of the Required Lenders or any other Lender), any such agreement may (x) waive, amend or modify Section 6.14 (or the definition of First Lien Leverage Ratio or any component definition thereof, in each case, as any such definition is used solely for purposes of Section 6.14), (y) waive any Default or Event of Default resulting from a breach of Section 6.14 or (z) waive, amend or modify any condition precedent set forth in Section 4.02 hereof as it pertains to any Revolving Loan or Additional Revolving Loan;
 
(D)          solely with the consent of the relevant Issuing Banks and, in the case of clause (x), the Administrative Agent, any such agreement may (x) increase or decrease the Letter of Credit Sublimit or (y) waive, amend or modify any condition precedent set forth in Section 4.02 hereof as it pertains to the issuance of any Letter of Credit; and
 
(E)           no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank hereunder, in each case in a manner directly and adversely affecting such Person, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be.
 
(c)           Subject to clause (E) of Section 9.02(b) but notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended:
 
(i)            with the written consent of the Borrower and the Lenders providing the relevant Replacement Term Loans to permit the refinancing or replacement of all or any portion

(H)          either (i) the other terms and conditions of any Replacement Revolving Facility (excluding pricing, interest, fees, rate floors, premiums, optional prepayment or redemption terms, security and maturity, subject to preceding clauses (B) through (G)) are substantially identical to, or (taken as a whole) no more favorable (as reasonably determined by the Borrower) to the lenders providing such Replacement Revolving Facility than those applicable to the Replaced Revolving Facility (other than covenants or other provisions applicable only to periods after the Latest Revolving Credit Maturity Date (in each case, as of the date of incurrence of the relevant Replacement Revolving Facility)) or (ii) such Replacement Revolving Facility are provided on then-current market terms (as reasonably determined by the Borrower) for the applicable type of Indebtedness, and
 
(I)            the commitments in respect of the relevant Replaced Revolving Facility shall be terminated, and all loans outstanding thereunder and all fees then due and payable in connection therewith shall be paid in full, in each case on the date any Replacement Revolving Facility is implemented;
 
provided, further, that, in respect of each of sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of this clause (c), any Non-Debt Fund Affiliate and Debt Fund Affiliate shall (x) be permitted without the consent of the Administrative Agent to provide any Replacement Term Loans, it being understood that in connection therewith, the relevant Non-Debt Fund Affiliate or Debt Fund Affiliate, as applicable, shall be subject to the restrictions applicable to such Person under Section 9.05 as if such Replacement Term Loans were term loans acquired by assignment and (y) any Debt Fund Affiliate (but not any Non-Debt Fund Affiliate) may provide any Replacement Revolving Facility.
 
Each party hereto hereby agrees that this Agreement may be amended by each of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the lenders providing the relevant Replacement Term Loans or the Replacement Revolving Facility, as applicable, to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of such Replacement Term Loans or Replacement Revolving Facility, as applicable, incurred or implemented pursuant thereto (including any amendment necessary to treat the loans and commitments subject thereto as a separate tranche and Class of Loans or commitments hereunder). It is understood that any Lender approached to provide all or a portion of any Replacement Term Loans or any Replacement Revolving Facility may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide such Replacement Term Loans or Replacement Revolving Facility.
 
(d)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.02 or any other provision of this Agreement or any provision of any other Loan Document:
 
(i)            the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may, without the input or consent of any Lender, amend, supplement or waive any guaranty, collateral security agreement, pledge agreement or related document (if any) executed in connection with this Agreement to (A) comply with any Requirement of Law or the advice of counsel or (B) cause any such guaranty, collateral security agreement, pledge agreement or other document to be consistent with this Agreement or the relevant other Loan Documents,
 
(ii)           the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may, without the input or consent of any other Lender (other than the relevant Lenders (including Additional Lenders) providing Loans under such Sections), effect amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary in the reasonable opinion of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to (1) effect the provisions of Sections 2.22, 2.23, 5.11, 6.13 or 9.02(c), or any other provision specifying that any waiver, amendment or modification may be made with
 
165





 
the consent or approval of the Administrative Agent or (2) to add terms (including representations and warranties, conditions, prepayments, covenants or events of default), in connection with the addition of any Loan or Commitment hereunder, that are favorable to the then-existing Lenders, as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent,
 
(iii)          if the Administrative Agent and the Borrower have jointly identified any ambiguity, mistake, defect, inconsistency, obvious error or any error or omission of a technical nature or any necessary or desirable technical change, in each case, in any provision of any Loan Document, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend such provision solely to address such matter as reasonably determined by them acting jointly,
 
(iv)          the Administrative Agent and, to the extent contemplated by such agreement, the Borrower may amend, restate, amend and restate or otherwise modify any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement to give effect thereto or to carry out the purposes thereof without the consent of any Lender so long as such amendment, supplement, waiver or modification is not materially adverse to the Lenders,
 
(v)           [Reserved],
 
(vi)          no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder, except that the Commitment and any Additional Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased without the consent of such Defaulting Lender (it being understood that any Commitment or Loan held or deemed held by any Defaulting Lender shall be excluded from any vote hereunder that requires the consent of any Lender, except as expressly provided in Section 2.21(b)), and
 
(vii)         this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (i) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit any extension of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the relevant benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Lenders prior to such inclusion.
 
Section 9.03.         Expenses; Indemnity.
 
(a)           The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by each Agent and their respective Affiliates (but limited, in the case of legal fees and expenses, to the actual reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, disbursements and other charges of one firm of outside counsel to all such Persons taken as a whole and, if reasonably necessary, of one local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction to all such Persons, taken as a whole) in connection with the syndication and distribution (including via the Internet or through a service such as Intralinks) of the Credit Facilities, the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of the Loan Documents and any related documentation, including in connection with any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document (whether or not the transactions contemplated thereby are consummated, but only to the extent the preparation of any such amendment, modification or waiver was requested by the Borrower or any other Loan Party and except as otherwise provided in a separate writing between the Borrower or the relevant Agent), (ii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by each Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents, the Issuing Banks or the Lenders or any of their respective Affiliates (but limited, in the
 
166





 
case of legal fees and expenses, (x) to one firm of outside counsel to all such Persons taken as a whole and, solely in the case of an actual or potential conflict of interest, one additional counsel to each similarly situated group of Persons, and (y) if reasonably necessary, of one local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction to all such Persons, taken as a whole and, solely in the case of an actual or potential conflict of interest, one additional local counsel to each similarly situated group of Persons, in each such relevant jurisdiction) in connection with the enforcement, collection or protection of their respective rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including their respective rights under this Section 9.03, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder. Except to the extent required to be paid on the Closing Date, all amounts due under this paragraph (a) shall be payable by the Borrower within thirty days of receipt by the Borrower of an invoice setting forth such expenses in reasonable detail, together with reasonably detailed backup documentation supporting the relevant reimbursement request.
 
(b)           The Borrower shall indemnify each Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (but limited, in the case of legal fees and expenses, to one counsel to all Indemnitees taken as a whole and, if reasonably necessary, one local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction to all Indemnitees, taken as a whole and solely in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest, (x) one additional counsel to each similarly situated group of affected Indemnitees, taken as a whole, and (y) one additional local counsel to each similarly situated group of affected Indemnitees, taken as a whole), incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of the Loan Documents or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the Loans or any Letter of Credit, (iii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (and regardless of whether such matter is initiated by a third party or by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates) or (iv) any actual or alleged presence or Release of Hazardous Materials at, on, under or from any property or facility currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by any Loan Party or the Restricted Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability of any Loan Party or the Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, or liability (i) is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or, to the extent a final and non-appealable judgment finds that any such loss, claim, damage, or liability has resulted from such Persons material breach of the Loan Documents or (ii) arises out of any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding brought by such Indemnitee solely against another Indemnitee (other than any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding that is brought by or against any Agent, acting in its capacity as such) that does not involve any act or omission of the Sponsors, the Borrower or any of their respective affiliates or Subsidiaries. Each Indemnitee shall be obligated to refund or return any and all amounts paid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 9.03(b) to such Indemnitee for any fees, expenses, or damages to the extent such Indemnitee is not entitled to payment thereof in accordance with the terms hereof, as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. All amounts due under this clause (b) shall be payable by the Borrower within 30 days (x) after receipt by the Borrower of a written demand therefor, in the case of any indemnification obligations and (y) in the case of reimbursement of costs and expenses, after receipt by the Borrower of an invoice setting forth such costs and expenses in reasonable detail, together with reasonably detailed backup documentation supporting the relevant reimbursement request. This clause (b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.
 
(c)           The Borrower shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without the written consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
 
167





 
conditioned or delayed), but if any proceeding is settled with the written consent of the Borrower, or if there is a final judgment against any Indemnitee in any such proceeding, the Borrower agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee to the extent and in the manner set forth above. The Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnitee unless (i) such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability or claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) such settlement does not include any statement as to any admission of fault or culpability.
 
Section 9.04.         Waiver of Claim. To the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, no party to this Agreement shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any other party hereto, any Loan Party or any Related Party of any thereof, (a) on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or any Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof, except, in the case of any claim by any Indemnitee against the Borrower, to the extent such damages would otherwise be subject to indemnification pursuant to the terms of Section 9.03; provided that nothing in this sentence shall limit the Borrowers indemnity or reimbursement obligations under Section 9.03 to the extent such special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages are included in any third party claim in connection with which such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder and (b) in respect of any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through electronic, telecommunications or other information transmission systems, including SyndTrak, IntraLinks, the internet, email or similar electronic transmission systems, except, in each case under this clause (b) to the extent any such damages are found in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of, or material breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by, such Person or Indemnitee, in each case under this Section 9.04.
 
Section 9.05.         Successors and Assigns.
 
(a)           The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided that (i) except as provided under Section 6.07, the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with the terms of this Section 9.05 (any attempted assignment or transfer not complying with the terms of this Section 9.05 shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and permitted assigns, to the extent provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 9.05, Participants and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
(b)           (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of any Loan or Additional Commitment added pursuant to Sections 2.22, 2.23 or 9.02(c) at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent of:
 
(A)          the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, that (I) consent of the Borrower shall not be required
 
168





 
during the primary syndication of the Term Loans (other than assignments to Disqualified Institutions), (II) (x) the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any assignment of Term Loans or Term Commitments unless it has objected thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten Business Days after receipt of written notice thereof and (y) the consent of the Borrower shall not be required for any assignment of Term Loans or Term Commitments (1) to any Term Lender or any Affiliate of any Term Lender or an Approved Fund or (2) at any time when an Event of Default under Sections 7.01(a), 7.01(f) or 7.01(g) exists and (III) (x) the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any assignment of Revolving Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments unless it has objected thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten Business Days after receipt of written notice thereof, and (y) the consent of the Borrower shall not be required for any assignment of Revolving Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments (1) by any Revolving Lender to an Affiliate of such Revolving Lender, another Revolving Lender or an Approved Fund or (2) at any time when an Event of Default under Sections 7.01(a), 7.01(f) or 7.01(g) exists;
 
(B)          the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and
 
(C)          in the case of any Revolving Facility, each Issuing Bank (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
 
(ii)           Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
 
(A)          except in the case of any assignment to another Lender, any Affiliate of any Lender or any Approved Fund or any assignment of the entire remaining amount of the relevant assigning Lenders Loans or Commitments of any Class, the principal amount of Loans or Commitments of the assigning Lender subject to the relevant assignment (determined as of the date on which the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent and determined on an aggregate basis in the event of concurrent assignments to Related Funds or by Related Funds) shall not be less than (x) $1,000,000, in the case of Term Loans and Term Commitments and (y) $5,000,000 in the case of Revolving Loans and Revolving Credit Commitments, unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent;
 
(B)          any partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the relevant assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement;
 
(C)          the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent (or, if previously agreed with the Administrative Agent, manually), and shall pay to the Administrative Agent a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee may be waived or reduced in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent); and
 
(D)          the relevant Eligible Assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver on or prior to the effective date of such assignment, to the Administrative Agent (1) an Administrative Questionnaire and (2) any Internal Revenue Service form required under Section 2.17.
 
169





 
(iii)                               Subject to the acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section 9.05, from and after the effective date specified in any Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be (A) entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring on or prior to the effective date of such assignment and (B) subject to its obligations thereunder and under Section 9.13). If any assignment by any Lender holding any Promissory Note is made after the issuance of such Promissory Note, the assigning Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such assignment or as promptly thereafter as practicable, surrender such Promissory Note to the Administrative Agent for cancellation, and, following such cancellation, if requested by either the assignee or the assigning Lender, the Borrower shall issue and deliver a new Promissory Note to such assignee or to such assigning Lender, with appropriate insertions, to reflect the new commitments or outstanding Loans of the assignee or the assigning Lender.
 
(iv)                              The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, and the commitment of, and principal amount of and interest on the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect the Borrowers obligations in respect of such Loans and LC Disbursements. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, each Issuing Bank and each Lender (but only as to its own holdings), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(v)                                 Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an Eligible Assignee, the Eligible Assignees completed Administrative Questionnaire and any tax certification required by Section 9.05(b)(ii)(D)(2) (unless the assignee is already a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 9.05, if applicable, and any written consent to the relevant assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section 9.05, the Administrative Agent shall promptly accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
 
(vi)                              By executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption, the assigning Lender and the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be deemed to confirm and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (A) the assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and that the amount of its commitments, and the outstanding balances of its Loans, in each case without giving effect to any assignment thereof which has not become effective, are as set forth in such Assignment and Assumption, (B) except as set forth in clause (A) above, the
 
170





 
assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto, or the financial condition of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or the performance or observance by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of any of its obligations under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (C) the assignee represents and warrants that it is an Eligible Assignee, legally authorized to enter into such Assignment and Assumption (and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such representation without any further investigation); (D) the assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Assumption; (E) the assignee will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it deems appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (F) the assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent, by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (G) the assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.
 
(c)                                  (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any other Lender, sell participations to any bank or other entity (other than to any Disqualified Institution, any natural Person or, other than with respect to any participation to any Debt Fund Affiliate (any such participations to a Debt Fund Affiliate being subject to the limitation set forth in the first proviso of the penultimate paragraph set forth in Section 9.05(g), as if the limitation applied to such participations), the Borrower or any of its Affiliates) (a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which any Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the relevant Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in (x) clause (A) of the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that directly and adversely affects the Loans or commitments in which such Participant has an interest and (y) clauses (B)(1), (2) or (3) of the first proviso to Section 9.02(b). Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section 9.05, the Borrower agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 9.05 (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.17(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender and the Administrative Agent, and if additional amounts are required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.17(a) or Section 2.17(c) in respect of such participation, to the Borrower). To the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.09 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.
 
171





 
(ii)                                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 than the participating Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent expressly acknowledging such Participant may receive a greater benefit and such Participant agrees to comply with Section 2.19 as if it was a Lender. Each Participant will comply with Section 2.17(f) as though it were a Lender and to deliver the tax forms required to claim an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document and then only to the extent of any amount to which such Lender would be entitled in the absence of any such participation (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.17(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender and the Administrative Agent).
 
Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and their respective successors and assigns, and the principal amounts and stated interest of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to any Participants interest in any Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or any other obligation under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and each Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
(d)                                 Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (other than to any Disqualified Institution or any natural person) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to any Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section 9.05 (other than this clause (d)) shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release any Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(e)                                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a Granting Lender) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an SPC), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of any Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17) and no SPC shall be entitled to any greater amount under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15 or any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that the Granting Lender would have been entitled to receive, (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender) and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes
 
172





 
including approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of the Loan Documents, remain the Lender of record hereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the Requirements of Law of the U.S. or any State thereof; provided that (i) such SPCs Granting Lender is in compliance in all material respects with its obligations to the Borrower hereunder and (ii) each Lender designating any SPC hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such SPC during such period of forbearance. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.05, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guaranty or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.
 
(f)                                   (i) Upon the request of any Lender, the Borrower shall make available to such Lender the list of Disqualified Institutions provided to the Arrangers prior to the Closing Date, if any, along with any additions, deletions or modifications to such list as provided to the Administrative Agent after the Closing Date pursuant to the definition of the term Disqualified Institution. Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 9.05 or any other provision of any Loan Document to the contrary, with respect to any assignment, participation or pledge or assignment of a security interest by a Lender without the Borrowers consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or the Borrowers deemed consent to any Disqualified Institution or any Affiliate thereof, the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Institution and the Administrative Agent (x) terminate any Revolving Credit Commitment of such Disqualified Institution and repay any applicable outstanding Loans and other obligations of the Borrower owing to such Disqualified Institution in connection with such Revolving Credit Commitment, (y) in the case of outstanding Term Loans held by such Disqualified Institution, purchase or prepay such Term Loans at a price equal to the lesser of par and the amount such person paid to acquire such Loans, in each case, plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts payable to it hereunder), and/or (z) require such Disqualified Institution to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.05 other than payment of the processing and recordation fee specified in paragraph (b)(ii)(C) above), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees at the price indicated above; provided that upon inquiry by any Lender, Participant, bona fide potential assignee or bona fide prospective participant to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall have the right, and the Borrower hereby expressly authorizes the Administrative Agent, to provide the list of Disqualified Institutions made in accordance with the definition of Disqualified Institutions (as updated thereto from time to time) to such Person or to disclose to such Person whether such Person or a specific potential assignee or prospective participant is a Disqualified Institution; provided, further, that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to notify any such Person of updates after the date such Person requests such information; provided that, without prejudicing any right or remedy that the Borrower may otherwise have at law or equity, to the extent such Disqualified Institution has assigned its Loans to an Eligible Assignee (which is not an Affiliate of such Person), at the Borrowers written election, the assignment to such Eligible Assignee shall be deemed effective for all purposes of the Loan Documents irrespective of such Disqualified Institution having previously held the applicable Loan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any responsibility or liability for monitoring the list of Disqualified Institutions or enforcing the Borrowers or any Lenders compliance with the terms of any of the provisions set forth herein with respect to Disqualified Institutions or otherwise have any liability in connection with the foregoing, except to the
 
173





 
extent arising from the Administrative Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
 
(ii) If any assignment or participation under this Section 9.05 is made to any Affiliate of any Disqualified Institution without the Borrowers prior written consent (any such person, a Disqualified Person), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Person and the Administrative Agent, require such Disqualified Person to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 9.05), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees; provided that (I) the relevant assignment shall otherwise comply with this Section 9.05 (except that (x) no registration and processing fee required under this Section 9.05 shall be required with any assignment pursuant to this paragraph and (y) any Term Loan acquired by any Affiliated Lender pursuant to this paragraph will not be included in calculating compliance with the Affiliated Lender Cap for a period of ninety days following such transfer) and (II) to the extent such Disqualified Institution has assigned its Loans to an Eligible Assignee (which is not an Affiliate of such Person) with the written consent of the Borrower (if applicable), the assignment to such Eligible Assignee shall be deemed effective for all purposes of the Loan Documents and no new assignment shall be required irrespective of such Disqualified Institution having previously held the applicable Loan. Nothing in this Section 9.05(f) shall be deemed to prejudice any right or remedy that the Borrower may otherwise have under this Agreement or at law or equity.
 
(g)                                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender may, at any time, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of its Term Loans to any Affiliated Lender on a non-pro rata basis (A) through Dutch Auctions open to all Lenders holding the relevant Term Loans on a pro rata basis or (B) through open market purchases, in each case with respect to clauses (A) and (B), without the consent of the Administrative Agent; provided that:
 
(i)                                     any Term Loans acquired by the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be retired and cancelled immediately upon the acquisition thereof; provided that upon any such retirement and cancellation, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans shall be deemed reduced by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans so retired and cancelled, and each principal repayment installment with respect to the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.10(a) shall be reduced on a pro rata basis by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans so cancelled;
 
(ii)                                  any Term Loans acquired by any Non-Debt Fund Affiliate may (but shall not be required to) be contributed to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (it being understood that any such Term Loans shall be retired and cancelled promptly upon such contribution); provided that upon any such cancellation, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans shall be deemed reduced, as of the date of such contribution, by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans so contributed and cancelled, and each principal repayment installment with respect to the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.10(a) shall be reduced pro rata by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of Initial Term Loans so contributed and cancelled;
 
(iii)                               the relevant Affiliated Lender and assigning Lender shall have executed an Affiliated Lender Assignment and Assumption;
 
174





 
(iv)                              after giving effect to the relevant assignment and to all other assignments to all Affiliated Lenders, the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans then held by all Affiliated Lenders shall not exceed 25.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans then outstanding (after giving effect to any substantially simultaneous cancellations thereof) (the Affiliated Lender Cap); provided that each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever incurred or suffered by any Person in connection with any compliance or non-compliance with this clause (g)(iv) or any purported assignment exceeding the Affiliated Lender Cap; provided, further, that to the extent that any assignment to any Affiliated Lender would result in the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans held by Affiliated Lenders exceeding the Affiliated Lender Cap (after giving effect to any substantially simultaneous cancellations thereof), the assignment of the relevant excess amount shall be null and void;
 
(v)                                 in connection with any assignment of rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of Term Loans effected pursuant to a Dutch Auction or open market purchase conducted by the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, (A) the relevant Person may not use the proceeds of any Revolving Loans to fund such assignment and (B) no Default or Event of Default may exist at the time of acceptance of bids for the Dutch Auction or the confirmation of such open market purchase, as applicable; and
 
(vi)                              by its acquisition of Term Loans, each relevant Affiliated Lender shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that:
 
(A)                               the Term Loans held by such Affiliated Lender shall be disregarded in both the numerator and denominator in the calculation of any Required Lender or other Lender vote (and the Term Loans held by such Affiliated Lender shall be deemed to be voted pro rata along with the other Lenders that are not Affiliated Lenders); provided that (x) such Affiliated Lender shall have the right to vote (and the Term Loans held by such Affiliated Lender shall not be so disregarded) with respect to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action that requires the vote of all Lenders or all Lenders directly and adversely affected thereby, as the case may be, and (y) no amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action shall (1) disproportionately affect such Affiliated Lender in its capacity as a Lender as compared to other Lenders of the same Class that are not Affiliated Lenders or (2) deprive any Affiliated Lender of its share of any payments which the Lenders are entitled to share on a pro rata basis hereunder, in each case without the consent of such Affiliated Lender; and
 
(B)                               such Affiliated Lender, solely in its capacity as an Affiliated Lender, will not be entitled to (i) attend (including by telephone) or participate in any meeting or discussion (or portion thereof) among the Administrative Agent or any Lender or among Lenders to which the Loan Parties or their representatives are not invited or (ii) receive any information or material prepared by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any communication by or among the Administrative Agent and one or more Lenders, except to the extent such information or materials have been made available by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any Loan Party or its representatives (and in any case, other than the right to receive notices of Borrowings, prepayments and other administrative notices in respect of its Term Loans required to be delivered to Lenders pursuant to Article 2);
 
175





 
(vii)                           no Affiliated Lender shall be required to represent or warrant that it is not in possession of material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or their respective securities in connection with any assignment permitted by this Section 9.05(g); and
 
(viii)                        in any bankruptcy or similar proceeding, no Affiliated Lender shall have any right to vote its interest in respect of any Term Loan (it being understood that its interest will be deemed to be voted in the same proportion as the vote of non-Affiliated Lenders on the relevant matter), except that to the extent that any plan of reorganization or other arrangement with respect to which the relevant vote is sought proposes to treat the interest of the relevant Affiliated Lender in such Term Loan in a manner that is less favorable to such Affiliated Lender than the proposed treatment of Term Loans held by other Lenders.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender may, at any time, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of its Term Loans to any Debt Fund Affiliate, and any Debt Fund Affiliate may, from time to time, purchase Term Loans (x) on a non-pro rata basis through Dutch Auctions open to all applicable Lenders or (y) on a non-pro rata basis through open market purchases without the consent of the Administrative Agent, in each case, notwithstanding the requirements set forth in subclauses (i) through (vii) of this clause (g); provided that the Loans and Commitments held by all Debt Fund Affiliates shall not account for more than 30.0% of the amounts included in determining whether the Required Lenders have (A) consented to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of any Loan Document or any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, (B) otherwise acted on any matter related to any Loan Document or (C) directed or required the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under any Loan Document (it being understood and agreed that any Term Loans held by Debt Fund Affiliates in excess of such 30.0% of such amounts will be deemed to be voted pro rata along with the votes of the Lenders eligible to vote under the relevant class of Lenders that are not Debt Fund Affiliates). Any Loans acquired by any Debt Fund Affiliate may (but shall not be required to) be contributed to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of cancelling such Indebtedness (it being understood that any Loans so contributed shall be retired and cancelled immediately upon thereof); provided that upon any such cancellation, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the relevant Class of Loans shall be deemed reduced, as of the date of such contribution, by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of the Loans so contributed and cancelled, and each principal repayment installment with respect to the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.10(a) shall be reduced pro rata by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of any applicable Term Loans so contributed and cancelled.
 
Section 9.06.                          Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loan and issuance of any Letter of Credit regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect until the Termination Date. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 9.03 and 9.13 and Article 8 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Revolving Credit Commitment, the occurrence of the Termination Date or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof but in each case, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.

Section 9.07.                          Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Fee Letter constitute the entire agreement among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective when it has been executed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent has received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or by email as a .pdf or .tif attachment shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
 
Section 9.08.                          Severability. To the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, any provision of any Loan Document held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
Section 9.09.                          Right of Setoff. At any time when an Event of Default exists, upon the written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank and each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations (in any currency) at any time owing by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Loan Party against any of and all the Secured Obligations held by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender shall have made any demand under the Loan Documents and although such obligations may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or Issuing Bank different than the branch or office holding such deposit or obligation on such Indebtedness. Any applicable Lender or Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of such set-off or application; provided that any failure to give or any delay in giving such notice shall not affect the validity of any such set-off or application under this Section 9.09. The rights of each Lender, each Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.09 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent may have.

Section 9.14.                          No Fiduciary Duty. Each Agent, each Lender, each Issuing Bank and their respective Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this paragraph, the Lenders), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Loan Parties, their stockholders or their respective affiliates. Each Loan Party agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Lender, on the one hand, and such Loan Party, its respective stockholders or its respective affiliates, on the other. Each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arms-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Lender, in its capacity as such, has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Loan Party, its respective stockholders or its respective affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise any Loan Party, its respective stockholders or its respective Affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to any Loan Party except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender, in its capacity as such, is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of such Loan Party, its respective management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person.

Section 9.16.                          USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender that is subject to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act hereby notifies the Loan Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of such Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender to identify such Loan Party in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act.

Section 9.17.                          Disclosure of Agent Conflicts.

If any Lender or Issuing Bank (other than the Administrative Agent) obtains possession of any Collateral, such Lender, Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof and, promptly upon the Administrative Agents request therefor, shall deliver such Collateral to the Administrative Agent or otherwise deal with such Collateral in accordance with the Administrative Agents instructions.
 
Section 9.19.                          Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan or Letter of Credit, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan or Letter of Credit under applicable Requirements of Law (collectively the Charged Amounts), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender or Issuing Bank holding such Loan or Letter of Credit in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan or Letter of Credit hereunder, together with all Charged Amounts payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charged Amounts that would have been payable in respect of such Loan or Letter of Credit but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section 9.19 shall be cumulated and the interest and Charged Amounts payable to such Lender or Issuing Bank in respect of other Loans or Letters of Credit or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, have been received by such Lender or Issuing Bank.
 
Section 9.20.                          Conflicts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any other Loan Document, the terms of this Agreement shall govern and control.
 
Section 9.21.                          Release of Loan Guarantors. Notwithstanding anything in Section 9.02(b) to the contrary, (a) any Loan Guarantor shall automatically be released from its obligations hereunder (and its Loan Guaranty shall be automatically released) (i) upon the consummation of any permitted transaction or series of related transactions if as a result thereof such Loan Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary (or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary as a result of a single transaction or series of related transactions permitted hereunder) or (ii) upon the occurrence of the Termination Date; provided that (i) no such release under clause (a) hereof shall occur solely because a Loan Guarantor has become an Excluded Subsidiary unless the Borrower so elects and (ii) to the extent any Restricted Subsidiary becomes an Excluded Subsidiary and is released from its guarantee hereunder, any such release under clause (a) hereof shall constitute an Investment as of the date of such release. In connection with any such release, the Administrative Agent shall promptly execute and deliver to the relevant Loan Party, at such Loan Partys expense, all documents that such Loan Party shall reasonably request to evidence termination or release. Any execution and delivery of any document pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Section 9.21 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent (other than as to the Administrative Agents authority to execute and deliver such documents).
 
Section 9.22.                          Judgment Currency. If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document from one currency into another
 
181





 
currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the Judgment Currency) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the Agreement Currency), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agree to the extent permitted under applicable law, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable Requirements of Law).
 
Section 9.23.                          Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
 
(a)                                 the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and
 
(b)                                 the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
 
(i)             a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
 
(ii)          a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
 
(iii)       the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.

Section 2.03.                          No Discharge or Diminishment of Loan Guaranty.
 
(a)                                 Except for the termination or release of a Loan Guarantors obligations hereunder as expressly permitted by Section 3.14, the obligations of each Loan Guarantor hereunder are unconditional, irrevocable and absolute and not subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including, without limitation: (i) any claim of waiver, release, extension, renewal, settlement, surrender, alteration, or compromise of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, by operation of law or otherwise; (ii) any change in the corporate or other organizational existence, structure or ownership of any Obligated Party or the lack of legal existence of the Borrower or any other Obligated Party; (iii) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting any other Obligated Party, or its assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Obligated Party; (iv) the existence of any claim, setoff or other right which any Loan Guarantor may have at any time against any Obligated Party, the Administrative Agent, any other Secured Party or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or in any unrelated transactions; (v) any direction as to application of payments by the Borrower or by any other party; (vi) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Guaranteed Obligations; (vii) any payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking; (viii) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by the Borrower; (ix) any payment made to any Secured Party on the Guaranteed Obligations which any such Secured Party repays to the Borrower pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and each Loan Guarantor waives any

right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding; (x) any increase at any time or from time to time of the Guaranteed Obligations that exceeds the Maximum Liability of any Loan Guarantor hereunder (provided that nothing in this clause shall be construed to increase any Loan Guarantors obligations hereunder beyond its Maximum Liability); (xi) the release under Section 3.14 or joinder under Section 3.04 of any other Loan Guarantor; (xii) any action or failure to act by the Borrower, any other Loan Guarantor or any other Person which may adversely affect such Loan Guarantors rights of contribution or subrogation (if any) against the Borrower to recover payments made under this Loan Guaranty, or this Loan Guaranty or the Credit Agreement having been determined (on whatsoever grounds) to be invalid, non-binding or unenforceable against any Loan Guarantor ab initio or at any time after the date hereof; or (xiii) any other circumstance (including statute of limitations), act or omission whatsoever which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower or any other Loan Guarantor for the Guaranteed Obligations, or of such Loan Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Article 2 (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations).  Each Loan Guarantor expressly authorizes the applicable Secured Parties, as set forth in the Loan Documents, to take and hold security for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, to exchange, waive or release any or all such security (with or without consideration), to enforce or apply such security and direct the order and manner of any sale thereof in their sole discretion or to release or substitute any one or more other guarantors or obligors upon or in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations all without affecting the obligations of any Loan Guarantor hereunder.
 
(b)                                 Except for termination of a Loan Guarantors obligations hereunder as expressly permitted by Section 3.14, the obligations of each Loan Guarantor hereunder are not subject to (i) any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise or (ii) any Requirements of Law purporting to prohibit payment by any Obligated Party of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof.
 
(c)                                  Further, the obligations of any Loan Guarantor hereunder are not discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by: (i) the election not to or failure of the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) any waiver or modification of or supplement to any provision of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) any release, non-perfection, or invalidity of any indirect or direct security for the obligations of the Borrower for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any obligations of any other guarantor of or other Person liable for any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) any action or failure to act by the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party with respect to any Collateral securing any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (v) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other circumstance, act, omission or delay that might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Loan Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Loan Guarantor as a matter of law or equity, in each case other than as set forth in Section 3.14.
 
Section 2.04.                          Defenses Waived.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, and except for termination of a Loan Guarantors obligations hereunder as expressly permitted by Section 3.14, each Loan Guarantor hereby waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower or any other Loan Guarantor or arising out of the disability of the Borrower or any other Loan Guarantor or any other party or the unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower or any other Loan Guarantor. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Loan Guarantor irrevocably

waives acceptance hereof, diligence, presentment, demand, protest, marshaling and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, any notice not provided for herein or in any other Loan Document, including any notice of non-payment, nonperformance, or default, notice of protest, notice of dishonor, notice of acceptance of this Loan Guaranty, and any notice of the existence, creation, amendment of, or incurring of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against any Obligated Party, or any other Person, including any right (except as may be required by applicable Requirements of Law and to the extent the relevant requirement cannot be waived) to require the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to (i) proceed against the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any Collateral held from the Borrower, any other Loan Guarantor or any other Person or (iii) pursue any other remedy in the Administrative Agents or any other Secured Partys power whatsoever. The Administrative Agent may, at its election and in accordance with the terms of the applicable Loan Documents, foreclose on any Collateral held by it by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such Collateral in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise act or fail to act with respect to any Collateral securing all or a part of the Guaranteed Obligations, and the Administrative Agent may, at its election, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Obligated Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to it against any Obligated Party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of such Loan Guarantor under this Loan Guaranty, except to the extent a Loan Guarantor is released as expressly provided in Section 3.14.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, each Loan Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election may operate, pursuant to applicable Requirements of Law, to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of any Loan Guarantor against any Obligated Party or any security.
 
Section 2.05.                          Authorization. The Loan Guarantors authorize the Administrative Agent without notice or demand (except as may be required by applicable Requirements of Law and to the extent the applicable requirement cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder, from time to time, subject to any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement then in effect and the terms of any applicable Loan Documents, to:
 
ARTICLE 1(a)  change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change or extend the time of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter, any of the Guaranteed Obligations (including any increase or decrease in the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest or fees thereon), any security therefor, or any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and this Loan Guaranty shall apply to the Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed or altered;

ARTICLE 3(c)  exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Borrower, any other Loan Party or others or otherwise act or refrain from acting with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations;
 
ARTICLE 4(d)  release or substitute any endorser, any guarantor, the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other obligor with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations;

Section 2.06.                          Rights of Subrogation.  No Loan Guarantor will assert any right, claim or cause of action, including any claim of subrogation, contribution or indemnification that it has against any Loan Party in respect of this Loan Guaranty until the occurrence of the Termination Date; provided that if any amount is paid to such Loan Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time prior to the Termination Date, then unless such Loan Guarantor has already satisfied its liabilities by indefeasible payment in full in immediately available funds under this Loan Guaranty in an amount equal to such Loan Guarantors Maximum Liability as of such date, such amount shall be held by the recipient Loan Guarantor, segregated from the other funds of such recipient Loan Guarantor, in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid by the recipient Loan Guarantor to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with Section 2.18(b) of the Credit Agreement.

Section 2.09.                          Contribution; Subordination; Maximum Liability.
 
(a)                                 In the event that any Loan Guarantor (a Paying Guarantor) makes any payment or payments under this Loan Guaranty or suffers any loss as a result of any realization upon any Collateral granted by it to secure its obligations under this Loan Guaranty (each such payment or loss, an Accommodation Payment), each other Loan Guarantor (each a Non-Paying Guarantor) shall contribute to such Paying Guarantor an amount equal to such Non-Paying Guarantors Guarantor Percentage of such Accommodation Payment by such Paying Guarantor, which amount shall be determined as of the date on which such Accommodation Payment was made.  As of any date of determination, each Non-Paying Guaran

e UFTA or Section 5 of the UFCA, or (iii) leaving such Loan Guarantor unable to pay its debts as they become due within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 4 of the UFTA or Section 5 of the UFCA. Nothing in this provision shall affect any Loan Guarantors several liability for the entire amount of the Guaranteed Obligations (up to such Loan Guarantors Maximum Liability).  Each of the Loan Guarantors covenants and agrees that its right to receive any contribution under this Loan Guaranty from a Non-Paying Guarantor shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Secured Obligations until the Termination Date. If, prior to the Termination Date, any such contribution payment is received by a Paying Guarantor at any time when an Event of Default exists, such contribution payment shall be collected, and segregated from the funds of the Paying Guarantor, enforced and received by such Loan Guarantor as trustee for the Secured Parties and be paid over to the Administrative Agent on account of the Secured Obligations, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of such Loan Guarantor under the other provisions of this Loan Guaranty. This provision is for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties and may, subject to any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement and the Loan Documents, be enforced by any one, or more, or all of them in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.  The provisions hereof shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Loan Guarantor to the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party and each Loan Guarantor shall remain liable to the Administrative Agent and each Secured Party for the full amount of the Guaranteed Obligations.
 
(b)                                 It is the desire and intent of the Loan Guarantors and the Secured Parties that this Loan Guaranty shall be enforced against the Loan Guarantors to the fullest extent permissible under the Requirements of Law and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  The provisions of this Loan Guaranty are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, Federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Requirements of Law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Loan Guarantor under this Loan Guaranty would otherwise be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of such Loan Guarantors liability under this Loan Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Loan Guaranty to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Loan Guarantors or the Secured Parties, be automatically limited and reduced to such Loan

Guarantors Maximum Liability.  Each Loan Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the Maximum Liability of such Loan Guarantor without impairing this Loan Guaranty or affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party hereunder; provided that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to increase any Loan Guarantors obligations hereunder beyond its Maximum Liability.
 
Section 2.10.                          Information.  Each Loan Guarantor hereby acknowledges and agrees that such Loan Guarantor has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Loan Guaranty and each other Loan Document to which it is or is to be a party, and such Loan Guarantor has established adequate means of obtaining from each other Loan Guarantor on a continuing basis information pertaining to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties and prospects of each other Loan Guarantor.
 
Section 2.11.                          Representations and Warranties.
 
(a)                                 As, when (including the Closing Date) and to the extent (taking into account all materiality and other qualifiers) representations and warranties are required to be made in accordance with the terms of Article 3 of the Credit Agreement, each Loan Guarantor represents and warrants to the Secured Parties that the representations and warranties set forth in Article 3 of the Credit Agreement as they relate to such Loan Guarantor, each of which is incorporated herein by reference, are true and correct, and the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be entitled to rely on each of such representations and warranties as if they were fully set forth herein; provided that each such reference in each such representation and warranty to the Borrowers knowledge shall, for the purposes of this Section 2.11, be deemed to be a reference to such Loan Guarantors knowledge.
 
(b)                                 Each Loan Guarantor hereby represents and warrants that (i) it has obtained adequate information pertaining to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties and prospects of each other Loan Guarantor to evaluate its decision to enter into this Loan Guaranty, (ii) neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to any Loan Guarantor arising out of or in connection with this Loan Guaranty or any other Loan Document and the relationship between the Loan Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, on the other hand, in connection herewith is solely that of debtor and creditor and (iii) no joint venture is created by this Loan Guaranty or any other Loan Document or exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
 
Section 2.12.                          Covenants.  Each Loan Guarantor covenants and agrees that until the occurrence of the Termination Date (subject to the reinstatement of any Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with Section 2.07), such Loan Guarantor will perform and observe, and cause each of its Subsidiaries that is a Restricted Subsidiary to perform and observe, all of the terms, covenants and agreements set forth in the Loan Documents that the Borrower has agreed to cause such Loan Guarantor or such Subsidiaries to perform or observe, in each case except where such terms, covenants or agreements do not include the relevant Loan Guarantor or are otherwise not applicable to such Loan Guarantor.
 
ARTICLE 3 GENERAL PROVISIONS
 
Section 3.01.                          Liability Cumulative.  The liability of each Loan Guarantor under this Loan Guaranty is in addition to and shall be cumulative with any and all liabilities of such Loan Guarantor to

Section 3.02.                          No Waiver; Amendments.  No delay or omission of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party (subject to the provisions of Article 8 of the Credit Agreement) in exercising any right, remedy, power or privilege granted under this Loan Guaranty or any other Loan Document shall impair such right, remedy, power or privilege or preclude any further exercise thereof or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein, and any single or partial exercise of any such right, remedy, power or privilege shall not preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.  The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether any Secured Party, any Loan Party or any other Person may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time. Except as set forth in Section 3.04, no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Loan Guaranty whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Loan Guarantors and the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement and then only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing.
 
Section 3.03.                          Severability of Provisions.  To the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, any provision of this Loan Guaranty that is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Loan Guaranty; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
Section 3.04.                          Additional Subsidiaries.  Certain Restricted Subsidiaries shall be required to enter into this Loan Guaranty as Loan Guarantors pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5.11 of the Credit Agreement.  Upon execution and delivery by any

I-10





 
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LOAN GUARANTY OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS LOAN GUARANTY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.
 
Section 3.10.                          Indemnity.  Each Loan Guarantor hereby agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and the other Indemnitees, as set forth in Section 9.03(b) of the Credit Agreement, subject to the limitations set forth therein.
 
Section 3.11.                          Counterparts.  This Loan Guaranty may be executed in counterparts (and by the different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Loan Guaranty by facsimile or by email as a .pdf or .tif attachment shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Loan Guaranty.

Except in a transaction permitted (or not restricted) under the Credit Agreement, no Loan Guarantor may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the written consent of the Administrative Agent.
 
Section 3.13.                          Survival of Agreement.  Without limitation of any provision of the Credit Agreement, all covenants, agreements, indemnities, representations and warranties made by the Loan Guarantors in this Loan Guaranty and the other Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Loan Guaranty or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Secured Parties and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such Secured Party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and shall continue in full force and effect until the Termination Date, or with respect to any individual Loan Guarantor until such Loan Guarantor is otherwise released from its obligations under this Loan Guaranty in accordance with Section 3.14.
 
Section 3.14.                          Release of Loan Guarantors.  This Loan Guaranty shall continue in effect until the Termination Date, and this Loan Guaranty shall be automatically terminated and each relevant Loan Guarantor hereunder shall be automatically released from its obligations hereunder in the circumstances described in Article 8 and Section 9.21 of the Credit Agreement at that time.  Prior to the Termination Date, a Loan Guarantor shall only be released from its obligations hereunder to the extent such release is permitted by Article 8 and Section 9.21 of the Credit Agreement; provided that, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Responsible
 
I-11





 
Officer certifying that such release is permitted pursuant to Article 8 and Section 9.21 of the Credit Agreement (it being understood that the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely on such certificate in releasing such Loan Guarantor).  In connection with any such termination and release, the Administrative Agent shall promptly execute and deliver to any Loan Guarantor, at such Loan Guarantors expense, all documents that such Loan Guarantor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination and release. Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Section 3.14 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent (other than as to the Administrative Agents authority to execute and deliver such documents). The Administrative Agent shall have no liability whatsoever to any Secured Party as a result of any release of any Loan Guarantor by it as permitted (or which the Administrative Agent in good faith believes to be permitted; it being acknowledged and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely on a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower or any other Grantor in making such determination) by this Section 3.14.
 
Section 3.15.                          Payments. All payments made by any Loan Guarantor hereunder will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense and on the same basis as payments are made by the Borrower under Sections 2.17 and 2.18 of the Credit Agreement.

(a)                                 if to any Loan Guarantor, addressed to it in care of the Borrower at its address specified in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement;
 
(b)                                 if to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, at its address specified in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement;

Section 3.17.                          Set Off.  In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable Requirements of Law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, while an Event of Default exists, the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank shall be entitled to rights of setoff to the extent provided in Section 9.09 of the Credit Agreement.
 
Section 3.18.                          Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc.  To the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, none of the Loan Guarantors nor the Secured Parties shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against each other or any Related Party thereof, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Loan Guaranty or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, except, in the case of any claim by any Indemnitee against any of the Loan Guarantors, to the extent such damages would otherwise be subject to indemnification pursuant to the terms of Section 3.10; provided that nothing in this sentence shall limit the Loan Guarantors indemnity or reimbursement obligations under Section 3.10 to the extent such special, 

nt conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).  This Section 3.19 shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of each Non-ECP Guarantor for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
 
Section 3.20.                          EFFECT OF INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, THE GUARANTEE OF THE GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS GRANTED TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SECURED PARTIES, PURSUANT TO THIS LOAN GUARANTY AND THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHT OR REMEDY BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ANY ACCEPTABLE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT IN EFFECT. IN THE EVENT OF ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN THE PROVISIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT IN EFFECT AND THIS LOAN GUARANTY, THE PROVISIONS OF SUCH INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL.
