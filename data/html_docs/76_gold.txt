45
 

 
Base Rate Loans, and (ii) one (1) Business
Day prior to the requested date of any borrowing of Base Rate Loans.
 
2.3          Repayment
of Term Loans.  On each Quarterly Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable
account of the Lenders the principal amount of Term Loans then outstanding as follows:
 
(a)          in
the case of Closing Date Term A Loans, for the first eight Quarterly Payment Dates following the Closing Date beginning with the
Quarterly Payment Date occurring June 30, 2016, an amount equal to 1.25% of the aggregate initial principal amounts of all Closing
Date Term A Loans theretofore borrowed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.1 and, for each Quarterly Payment Date thereafter,
an amount equal to 2.50% of the aggregate initial principal amounts of all such Closing Date Term A Loans (which amounts shall
be reduced as a result of the application of prepayments in accordance with the order of priority set forth in Section 4.8 or as
designated by Borrower in accordance with Section 4.1).  The remaining unpaid principal amount of the Closing Date Term
A Loans and all other Obligations under or in respect of the Closing Date Term A Loans shall be due and payable in full, if not

as to such Lender’s Term A Loan.
 
(b)          in
the case of Closing Date Term B Loans, Date beginning with the Quarterly Payment Date occurring June 30, 2016, an amount equal
to 0.25% of the aggregate initial principal amounts of all Closing Date Term B Loans theretofore borrowed by the Borrower pursuant
to Section 2.1 (which amounts shall be reduced as a result of the application of prepayments in accordance with the order of priority

extended by individual Lenders as to such Lender’s Term B Loan.
 
2.4          Incremental
Term Loans.
 
(a)          Borrower
Request.  The Borrower may at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date by written notice to the Administrative
Agent elect to request the establishment of one or more new term loan facilities or an increase in any existing tranche of Term
Loans (each, an “Incremental Term Facility”) with term loan commitments (each, an “Incremental Term
Loan Commitment”) in an aggregate principal amount, when combined with the aggregate amount of Incremental Revolving
Commitments under Section 3.16) and all Incremental Equivalent Debt under Section 2.5, not in excess of: (i) $300,000,000 plus
(ii) the aggregate amount of all voluntary prepayments of Term Loans and voluntary prepayments of Revolving Loans with a corresponding
permanent reduction of the Revolving Commitments plus (iii) the maximum amount of additional Loans that could be incurred by the
Borrower at such time without causing the Consolidated Leverage Ratio to be greater than 3.00 to 1.0, calculated after giving pro
forma effect to the incurrence of such additional amount, excluding the cash proceeds of any Incremental Term Loans or Incremental
Revolving Commitments and assuming
 

46
 

 
the full amount of any
Incremental Revolving Commitments are borrowed (whether or not funded or outstanding) (it being understood and agreed that unless
notified by the Borrower, (I) the Borrower shall be deemed to have utilized, amounts of the type described in clause (iii) above
prior to the utilization of amounts under clauses (i) or (ii) above and (II) Loans may be incurred in respect of any or all of
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, and the proceeds from any such incurrence in respect of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, may
be utilized in a single transaction by, first, calculating the incurrence in respect of clause (iii) above (without giving
effect to any incurrence in respect of clause (i) or (ii)), second, calculating the incurrence in respect of clause (ii)
above and, third, calculating the incurrence in respect of clause (i) above) and in minimum increments of $10,000,000 (or
such lesser minimum increments as the Administrative Agent shall agree in its sole discretion) (the foregoing amount, the “Available
Incremental Amount”).  Each such notice shall specify (i) the date (each, a “Term Loan Increase Effective
Date”) on which the Borrower proposes that the Incremental Term Loan Commitment shall be effective, which shall be a
date not less than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such
earlier date as the Administrative Agent shall agree in its sole discretion) and (ii) the identity of each Person (which, if not
a Lender, an Approved Fund or an Affiliate of a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) to whom the
Borrower proposes any portion of such Incremental Term Loan Commitment be allocated and the amounts of such allocations.  
 
(b)          Conditions.  With
respect to any Incremental Term Commitments made after the Closing Date, such Incremental Term Loan Commitment shall become effective,
as of such Term Loan Increase Effective Date; provided that:
 
(i)          each
of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(c) and 6.2(d) shall be satisfied (except as otherwise set forth in the applicable Increase
Term Joinder);
 
(ii)         Each
of the representations and warranties made by any Loan Party in or pursuant to the Loan Documents shall be true and correct in
all material respects on and as of such date as if made on and as of such date (except to the extent made as of a specific date,
in which case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such specific date);
provided that, if the primary purpose of such Incremental Term Facility is to finance a Permitted Acquisition or an Investment
permitted under Section 8.7, the foregoing shall be limited to the Specified Representations (other than Section 5.19 with respect
to the target in such Permitted Acquisition and its subsidiaries);
 
(iii)        no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result from the borrowings to be made on the Term Loan
Increase Effective Date (except as otherwise set forth in the applicable Increase Term Joinder); provided that, if the primary
purpose of such Incremental Term Facility is to finance a Permitted Acquisition or an Investment permitted under Section 8.7, then
the foregoing shall be limited to no Specified Event of Default;
 
(iv)        the
Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered any customary legal opinions or other documents reasonably requested by the Administrative
Agent in connection with any such transaction.
 

47
 

 
(c)          Terms
of Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Term Loan Commitments.  The terms and provisions of the Term Loans made
pursuant to the Incremental Term Loan Commitments (the “Incremental Term Loans”) shall be as follows:
 
(i)          such
terms and provisions shall be consistent with the existing Term Loans (except as otherwise set forth herein) and, to the extent
not consistent with such existing Term Loans, on terms reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (except as otherwise set
forth herein) (it being understood that Incremental Term Loans may be part of the existing tranche of Term Loans or may comprise
one or more new tranches of Term Loans);
 
(ii)         the
weighted average life to maturity of all new Incremental Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining weighted average life
to maturity of the existing Term Loans or, if any Incremental Term Loans are structured as term A loans, then the weighted average
life to maturity of such Incremental Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining weighted average life to maturity of the
existing Term A Loans;
 
(iii)        the
maturity date of Incremental Term Loans shall not be earlier than the latest Term Loan Maturity Date or, if any Incremental Term
Loans are structured as term A loans, then the maturity date of such Incremental Term Loans shall not be earlier than the Term
A Loan Maturity Date;
 
(iv)        any
Incremental Term Facility shall have fees and, subject to the clauses (ii) and (iii) above and clause (vi) below, amortization
as agreed between the Borrower and the Lenders under such Incremental Term Facility;
 
(v)         any
Incremental Term Facility may provide for the ability to participate on a pro rata basis, or on a less than pro rata
basis, (but not on a greater than pro rata basis), in any voluntary or mandatory prepayments of Term Loans hereunder;
 
(vi)        the
applicable yield for the Incremental Term Loans shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable new Lenders; provided,
however, that the applicable yield (taking into account interest margins, minimum Eurodollar Rates and Base Rates, upfront
fees and OID on such term loans, with upfront fees and OID being equated to interest margins based on an assumed four year life
to maturity, but exclusive of any arrangement, syndication, structuring, commitment or other fees payable in connection therewith)
(the “Incremental Yield”) (other than any Incremental Term Facility that is unsecured, subordinated or secured
on a junior-lien basis) for the Incremental Term Loans shall not be greater than the highest applicable yield that may, under any
circumstances, be payable with respect to Term B Loans plus 50 basis points or, if an Incremental Term Facility is structured as
a term A facility, the Incremental Yield for such Incremental Term Facility shall not be greater than the highest applicable yield
that may, under any circumstances, be payable with respect to Term A Loans plus 50 basis points, in each case except to the extent
that the yield applicable to the
 

48
 

 
Term Loans is
increased to the extent necessary to achieve the foregoing, with any increase in yield to any existing Term Facility required due
to an application of any minimum interest rate on any Incremental Term Facility to be effected solely through an increase in applicable
minimum Eurodollar Rates and/or Base Rates hereunder; and
 
(vii)       Incremental
Term Loans may, at the Borrower’s discretion, rank pari passu in right of payment and security with other Loans or,
subject to Section 8.2(p), may be incurred as Junior Indebtedness (including Second Lien Indebtedness); provided that any
Incremental Term Loans secured on a pari passu basis with the existing Loans shall be incurred pursuant to the Loan Documents.
 
Incremental Term Loans
may be provided by any existing Lender (but no existing Lender shall have an obligation to make any Incremental Term Loan Commitment,
nor will the Borrower have any obligation to approach any existing Lenders to provide any Incremental Term Loan Commitment) and
additional banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders who will become Lenders in connection with such Incremental
Term Facility; provided that the consent of the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lenders and the Swingline Lender (in each
case not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be required with respect to any additional Lender to the same
extent such consent would for an assignment of an existing Loan to such Lender pursuant to Section 11.6(b).  The Incremental
Term Loan Commitments shall be effected by a joinder agreement (the “Increase Term Joinder”)
executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender making such Incremental Term Loan Commitment, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to each of them.  Incremental Term Loans may be used for the Borrower’s and its Subsidiaries’
general corporate purposes, including any transaction not prohibited under this Agreement.  The Increase Term Joinder
may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be
necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.4.  In
addition, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all references in the Loan Documents to Term Loans shall be deemed, unless
the context otherwise requires, to include references to Incremental Term Loans that are Term Loans made pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(d)          Making
of Incremental Term Loans.  On any Term Loan Increase Effective Date on which Incremental Term Loan Commitments are
effective, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, each Lender of such Incremental Term Loan Commitment
shall make an Incremental Term Loan to the Borrower in an amount equal to its Incremental Term Loan Commitment.
 
(e)          Equal
and Ratable Benefit.  The Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Term Loan Commitments established pursuant to this
Section 2.4 shall constitute Loans and Commitments under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by, this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, and without limiting the foregoing, if secured, in any case, shall benefit equally and ratably from
security interests created by the Security Documents and the guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors.  The Loan Parties
shall take any actions reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to ensure and/or demonstrate that the Lien and security
interests granted by the Security Documents continue to be perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code or
 

49
 

 
otherwise after giving
effect to the establishment of any such Class of Incremental Term Loans or any such Incremental Term Loan Commitments.
 
2.5          Incremental
Equivalent Debt.  (a)  At any time and from time to time, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Borrower may issue one or more series of Incremental Equivalent Debt in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed,
as of the date of and after giving effect to the issuance of any such Incremental Equivalent Debt when combined with the aggregate
amount of all Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Term Loan Commitments under Section 2.4 and Incremental Revolving Commitments
under Section 3.16 (other than those issued pursuant to clause (iii) of the first sentence of Section 3.16(a)), the Available
Incremental Amount.
 
(b)          The
issuance of any Incremental Equivalent Debt pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall (i) in all cases, be subject to the terms and
conditions applicable to Incremental Term Loan Commitments set forth under Section 2.4(b) (other than clause (ii) thereof)
and Section 2.4(c)(ii), and (iii), and (ii) the covenants, events of default, guarantees and other terms of such Incremental
Equivalent Debt shall be customary for similar debt instruments in light of then-prevailing market conditions at the time of issuance,
it being understood that a certificate of an Responsible Officer of the Borrower delivered to the Administrative Agent prior to
or at the incurrence of such Incremental Equivalent Debt, together with a reasonably detailed description of the material terms
and conditions of such Incremental Equivalent Debt or drafts of the documentation relating thereto, stating that the Borrower has
determined in good faith that such terms and conditions of the Incremental Equivalent Debt satisfy the requirement set forth in
this clause (ii), shall be conclusive evidence that such terms and conditions have been satisfied.
 
2.6           Extensions
of Loans.  (a)  The Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent from time to time, request
an extension (each, an “Extension”) of the maturity date of any Class of Loans and Commitments to the extended
maturity date specified in such notice.  Such notice shall (i) set forth the amount of the applicable Class of Revolving
Commitments and/or Term Loans that will be subject to the Extension (which shall be in minimum increments of $1.0 million and
a minimum amount of $20.0 million), (ii) set forth the date on which such Extension is requested to become effective (which shall
be not less than ten (10) Business Days nor more than sixty (60) days after the date of such Extension notice (or such longer
or shorter periods as the Administrative Agent shall agree in its sole discretion)) and (iii) identify the relevant Class of Revolving
Commitments and/or Term Loans to which such Extension relates.  Each Lender of the applicable Class shall be offered
(an “Extension Offer”) an opportunity to participate in such Extension on a pro rata basis and on the same
terms and conditions as each other Lender of such Class pursuant to procedures established by, or reasonably acceptable to, the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower.  If the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Commitments, Term A Loans or
Term B Loans in respect of which Lenders shall have accepted the relevant Extension Offer shall exceed the maximum aggregate principal
amount of Revolving Commitments, Term A Loans or Term B Loans, as applicable, subject to the Extension Offer as set forth in the
Extension notice, then the Revolving Commitments, Term A Loans or Term B Loans, as applicable, of Lenders of the applicable Class
shall be extended ratably up to such maximum amount based on the respective principal amounts with respect to which such Lenders
have accepted such Extension Offer.
 

50
 

 
(b)          The
following shall be conditions precedent to the effectiveness of any Extension: (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing immediately prior to and immediately after giving effect to such Extension, (ii) each of the representations
and warranties made by any Loan Party in or pursuant to the Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects on
and as of the date of such Extension (except to the extent made as of a specific date, in which case such representation and warranty
shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such specific date), (iii) the Issuing Lenders and the Swingline
Lender shall have consented to any Extension of the Revolving Commitments, to the extent that such Extension provides for the issuance
or extension of Letters of Credit or making of Swingline Loans at any time during the extended period and (iv) the terms of such
Extended Revolving Commitments and Extended Term Loans shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section.
 
(c)          The
terms of each Extension shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable extending Lenders and set forth in an Extension
Amendment; provided that (i) the final maturity date of any Extended Revolving Commitment shall be no earlier than the Revolving
Credit Maturity Date and the final maturity date of the Extended Term Loans shall be no earlier than, in the case of Extended Term
A Loans, the Term A Loan Maturity Date and in the case of Extended Term B Loans, the Term B Loan Maturity Date, (ii)(A) there shall
be no scheduled amortization of the loans or reductions of commitments under any Extended Revolving Commitments and (B) the average
life to maturity of the Extended Term A Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining average life to maturity of the existing Term
A Loans and the average life to maturity of the Extended Term B Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining average life to maturity
of the existing Term B Loans, (iii) the Extended Revolving Loans and the Extended Term Loans will rank pari passu in right of payment
and with respect to security with the existing Revolving Loans and the existing Term Loans and the borrower and guarantors of the
Extended Revolving Commitments or Extended Term Loans, as applicable, shall be the same as the Borrower and Guarantors with respect
to the existing Revolving Loans or Term Loans, as applicable, (iv) the interest rate margin, rate floors, fees, original issue
discount and premium applicable to any Extended Revolving Commitment (and the Extended Revolving Loans thereunder) and Extended
Term Loans shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable extending Lenders, (v)(A) the Extended Term Loans may participate
on a pro rata or less than pro rata (but not greater than pro rata) basis in voluntary or mandatory prepayments with the other
Term Loans and (B) borrowing and prepayment of Extended Revolving Loans, or reductions of Extended Revolving Commitments, and participation
in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans, shall be on a pro rata basis with the other Revolving Commitments (other than upon the
maturity of the non-extended Revolving Loans and Revolving Commitments) and (vi) the terms of the Extended Revolving Commitments
or Extended Term Loans, as applicable, shall be substantially identical to the terms set forth herein (except as set forth in clauses
(i) through (v) above).
 
(d)          In
connection with any Extension, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each applicable extending Lender shall execute and deliver
to the Administrative Agent an Extension Amendment and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify
to evidence the Extension.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each
Extension.  Any Extension Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lender, effect such amendments to this Agreement
and the other Loan
 

51
 

 
Documents as may be necessary
or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to implement the terms of any such Extension,
including any amendments necessary to establish Extended Revolving Commitments or Extended Term Loans as a new Class or tranche
of Revolving Commitments or Term Loans, as applicable, and such other technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in
the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new Class or tranche
(including to preserve the pro rata treatment of the extended and non-extended Classes or tranches and to provide for the reallocation
of Revolving Credit Exposure upon the expiration or termination of the commitments under any Class or tranche), in each case on
terms consistent with this section.
 
2.7           Fees.  The
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent such fees as have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at
the times so specified.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
 
SECTION 3.    AMOUNT
AND TERMS OF REVOLVING COMMITMENTS
 
3.1          Revolving
Commitments.  (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Revolving Lender severally agrees
to make revolving credit loans (“Revolving Loans”) to the Borrower
from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding which,
when added to such Lender’s Revolving Percentage of the sum of (i) the L/C Obligations then outstanding and (ii) the aggregate
principal amount of the Swingline Loans then outstanding, does not exceed the amount of such Lender’s Revolving Commitment.  During
the Revolving Availability Period the Borrower may use the Revolving Commitments by borrowing, prepaying and reborrowing the Revolving
Loans in whole or in part, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.  The Revolving Loans may from time
to time be Eurodollar Loans or Base Rate Loans, as determined by the Borrower and notified to the Administrative Agent in accordance
with Sections 3.2 and 4.3.
 
(a)          The
Borrower shall repay all outstanding Revolving Loans on the Revolving Termination Date, except to the extent extended by individual
Lenders as to such Lender’s Revolving Commitment.
 
3.2          Procedure
for Revolving Loan Borrowing.  The Borrower may borrow under the Revolving Commitments during the Revolving Availability
Period on any Business Day; provided that the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent its irrevocable (other than
requests for Revolving Loans to be borrowed on the Closing Date which may be revocable) notice, which may be given by (A) telephone
or (B) a Committed Loan Notice; provided that any telephone notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Administrative
Agent of a Committed Loan Notice (which notice must be received by the Administrative Agent for any Revolving Loans requested
to be made after the Closing Date, prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, (i) three (3) Business Days prior to the requested
Borrowing Date, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, or (ii) one (1) Business Day prior to the requested Borrowing Date, in the case
of Base Rate Loans) (provided that any such notice of a borrowing of Base Rate Loans to finance payments required to be
made pursuant to Section 3.5 may be given not later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the date of the proposed borrowing),
specifying (x) the amount and Type of Revolving Loans to be borrowed, (y) the requested Borrowing Date and (z) in the case
 

52
 

 
of Eurodollar Loans, the respective amounts
of each such Type of Loan and the respective lengths of the initial Interest Period therefor.  Each borrowing under the
Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount equal to (x) in the case of Base Rate Loans, $500,000 or a multiple of $100,000 in
excess thereof (or, if the then aggregate Available Revolving Commitments are less than $500,000, such lesser amount) and (y) in
the case of Eurodollar Loans, $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof; provided, that (x) the Swingline
Lender may request, on behalf of the Borrower, borrowings under the Revolving Commitments that are Base Rate Loans in other amounts
pursuant to Section 3.4 and (y) borrowings of Base Rate Loans pursuant to Section 3.11 shall not be subject to the foregoing minimum
amounts.  Upon receipt of any such notice from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving
Lender thereof.  Each Revolving Lender will make the amount of its pro rata share of each borrowing available
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at the Funding Office prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the
Borrowing Date requested by the Borrower in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative
Agent shall make the proceeds of such Revolving Loan available to the Borrower on such Borrowing Date by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account designated in writing by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent.  
 
3.3           Swingline
Commitment.  (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender, in reliance upon the
agreements of the other Lenders set forth in Section 3.4, will make, in its sole discretion, a portion of the credit otherwise
available to the Borrower under the Revolving Commitments from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period by making
swing line loans (“Swingline Loans”) to the Borrower, with all outstanding
Swingline Loans reducing the Available Revolving Commitments on a Dollar-for-Dollar basis; provided that (i) the aggregate
principal amount of Swingline Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed the Swingline Commitment then in effect (notwithstanding
that the Swingline Loans outstanding at any time, when aggregated with the Swingline Lender’s other outstanding Revolving
Loans hereunder, may exceed the Swingline Commitment then in effect) and (ii) the Borrower shall not request, and the Swingline
Lender shall not make, any Swingline Loan if, after giving effect to the making of such Swingline Loan, the aggregate amount of
the Available Revolving Commitments would be less than zero.  During the Revolving Availability Period, the Borrower
may use the Swingline Commitment by borrowing, repaying and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.  Swingline
Loans shall be Base Rate Loans only.
 
(a)          The
Borrower shall repay all outstanding Swingline Loans on the Revolving Termination Date.
 
3.4          Procedure
for Swingline Borrowing; Refunding of Swingline Loans.  (a)  Whenever the Borrower desires that the Swingline
Lender make Swingline Loans it shall give the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice, which may be given
by (A) telephone or (B) by a Swingline Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery
to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent of a Swingline Loan Notice (which notice must be received by the Swingline
Lender not later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the proposed Borrowing Date), specifying (i) the amount to be borrowed
and (ii) the requested Borrowing Date (which shall be a Business Day during the Revolving Availability Period).  Each
borrowing under the Swingline Commitment shall be in an
 

53
 

 
amount equal to $500,000 or a whole multiple
of $100,000 in excess thereof.  Not later than 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Borrowing Date specified in a notice
in respect of Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lender shall make available to the Borrower on such Borrowing Date by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to a bank account designated in writing by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent.
 
(a)          The
Swingline Lender, at any time and from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion may, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby
irrevocably directs the Swingline Lender to act on its behalf), on one (1) Business Day’s notice given by the Swingline Lender
to the Administrative Agent no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, request each Revolving Lender to make, and each Revolving
Lender hereby agrees to make, irrespective of the satisfaction of conditions to such Loan specified in Section 6.2, a Revolving
Loan, in an amount equal to such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Percentage of the aggregate amount of the Swingline Loans (the
“Refunded Swingline Loans”) outstanding on the date of such notice,
to repay the Swingline Lender.  Each Revolving Lender shall make the amount of such Revolving Loan available to the Administrative
Agent at the Funding Office in immediately available funds, not later than 10:00 A.M., New York City time, one (1) Business Day
after the date of such notice.  The proceeds of such Revolving Loans shall be immediately made available by the Administrative
Agent to the Swingline Lender for application by the Swingline Lender to the repayment of the Refunded Swingline Loans.  
 
(b)          If
prior to the time a Revolving Loan would have otherwise been made pursuant to Section 3.4(b), one of the events described in Section
9.1(f) shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the Borrower or if for any other reason, as determined by the Swingline
Lender in its sole discretion, Revolving Loans may not be made as contemplated by Section 3.4(b), each Revolving Lender shall,
on the date such Revolving Loan was to have been made pursuant to the notice referred to in Section 3.4(b) (the “Refunding
Date”), purchase for cash an undivided participating interest in the then outstanding Swingline Loans by paying
to the Swingline Lender an amount (the “Swingline Participation Amount”)
equal to (i) such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Percentage times (ii) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Swingline
Loans then outstanding that were to have been repaid with such Revolving Loans.
 
(c)          Whenever,
at any time after the Swingline Lender has received from any Revolving Lender such Lender’s Swingline Participation Amount,
the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of the Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lender will distribute to the Administrative
Agent for distribution to such Lender its Swingline Participation Amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments,
to reflect the period of time during which such Lender’s participating interest was outstanding and funded and, in the case
of principal and interest payments, to reflect such Lender’s pro rata portion of such payment if such payment
is not sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on all Swingline Loans then due); provided, however, that
in the event that such payment received by the Swingline Lender is required to be returned, such Revolving Lender will return to
the Administrative Agent, for immediate distribution to the Swingline Lender any portion thereof previously distributed to it by
the Swingline Lender.
 
(d)          Each
Revolving Lender’s obligation to make the Loans referred to in Section 3.4(b) and to purchase participating interests pursuant
to Section 3.4(c) shall be absolute
 

54
 

 
and unconditional and
shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such
Revolving Lender or the Borrower may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever;
(ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified
in Section 6; (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower; (iv) any breach of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Revolving Lender; or (v) any other circumstance,
happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
 
3.5          Fees.  (a)  The
Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a commitment fee (the “Commitment
Fee”) for the period from and including the Closing Date to the last day of the Revolving Availability Period, computed
at the Commitment Fee Rate on the average daily amount of the Available Revolving Commitment of such Lender during the period
for which payment is made payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December and on the
Revolving Termination Date.
 
(a)          The
Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the fees in the amounts and on the dates previously agreed to in writing by
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
 
3.6          Termination
or Reduction of Revolving Commitments.  The Borrower shall have the right, upon not less than three (3) Business
Days’ notice to the Administrative Agent, to terminate the Revolving Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce the amount
of the Revolving Commitments; provided that no such termination or reduction of Revolving Commitments shall be permitted
if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans made on the effective date thereof,
the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit would exceed the Total Revolving Commitments; provided, further that such
notice may be contingent on the occurrence of a refinancing or the consummation of a sale, transfer, lease or other disposition
of assets and may be revoked or the termination date deferred if the refinancing or sale, transfer, lease or other disposition
of assets does not occur.  Any such reduction shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000, or a multiple of $500,000 in
excess thereof, and shall reduce permanently the Revolving Commitments then in effect.
 
3.7          L/C
Commitment.  (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Issuing Lender, in reliance on the
agreements of the other Revolving Lenders set forth in Section 3.10(a), agrees to issue standby letters of credit (“Letters
of Credit”) for the account of the Borrower on any Business Day during the Revolving Availability Period as may
be approved from time to time by such Issuing Lender, with the face amount of any outstanding Letters of Credit (and, without
duplication, any unpaid drawing in respect thereof) reducing the Available Revolving Commitments on a Dollar-for-Dollar basis;
provided that no Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such
issuance, (i) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment or (ii) the aggregate amount of such Issuing Lender’s
Available Revolving Commitments would be less than zero.  Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated in Dollars,
(ii) have a face amount of at least $100,000 (unless otherwise
 

55
 

 
agreed by such Issuing Lender) and (iii)
expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance (unless otherwise agreed by the applicable
Issuing Lender) and (y) the date that is three (3) Business Days prior to the

h Issuing Lender or any request or directive
(whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Lender shall prohibit,
or request that such Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or the Letter of Credit in particular
or shall impose upon such Issuing Lender with respect to the Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for
which such Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon such
Issuing Lender any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which such Issuing Lender
in good faith deems material to it and (iii) the issuance of the Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such Issuing
Lender applicable to letters of credit generally.
 
3.8          Procedure
for Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension of Letters of Credit; Certain Conditions.  (a)  The Borrower
may from time to time request that an Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit.  To request the issuance of a Letter
of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy
(or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the relevant Issuing Lender) to such
Issuing Lender an Application requesting the issuance of the Letter of Credit and specifying the requested date of issuance of
such Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day) and, as applicable, specifying the date of amendment, renewal or extension
(which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with Section 3.7(a)(iii)),
the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information and documents,
including any Issuer Documents, as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit.  Such
Application shall be accompanied by documentary and other evidence of the proposed beneficiary’s identity as may reasonably
be requested by such Issuing Lender to enable such Issuing Lender to verify the beneficiary’s identity or to comply with
any applicable laws or regulations, including, without limitation, Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act of 2001, 31 U.S.C. Section
5318.  Provided such Issuing Lender has determined that the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of the requested
Letter of Credit in favor of the identified beneficiary is in compliance with U.S. Treasury and U.S. Department of Commerce regulations
and other applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations (including, without limitation, the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset
Control regulations), upon receipt of all required approvals, such Issuing Lender will issue, amend, renew or extend the requested
Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower in such form as may be approved by such Issuing Lender, which shall have been
approved by the Borrower, within (x) in the case of an issuance, five (5) Business Days of the
 

56
 

 
date of the receipt of the Application
and all related information and (y) in the case of an amendment, renewal or extension, three (3) Business Days of the date of the
receipt of the Application and all related information. Each Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) promptly following the issuance thereof.  An Issuing Lender shall
promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly furnish to the Lenders, notice of the issuance (or,
amendment, extension or renewal, as applicable) of each Letter of Credit (including the amount thereof) issued by such Issuing
Lender.
 
(a)          If
the Borrower so requests in any applicable Application, an Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter
of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an “Auto-Extension Letter of Credit”); provided
that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit such Issuing Lender to prevent any such extension at least once in each
twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof
not later than a day (the “Non-Extension Notice Date”) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at
the time such Letter of Credit is issued.  Unless otherwise directed by an Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall not be
required to make a specific request to such Issuing Lender for any such extension.  Once an Auto-Extension Letter of
Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) such Issuing Lender to permit the
extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to
the Revolving Termination Date; provided, however, that an Issuing Lender shall not permit any such extension if
(A) such Issuing Lender has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such
Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section 3.7(a) or (b)
or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business
Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit
such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified
in Section 6.2 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing such Issuing Lender not to permit such extension.
 
3.9          Fees
and Other Charges; Role of Issuing Lender; Applicability of ISP and UCP.  (a)  The Borrower will pay a
fee (the “L/C Fee”) on all outstanding Letters of Credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin
then in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans under the Revolving Facility on the face amount of such Letter of Credit, shared
ratably among the Revolving Lenders and payable quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the issuance date of such
Letter of Credit.  In addition, the Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee of
0.125% per annum on the undrawn and unexpired amount of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, payable quarterly
in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the issuance date of such Letter of Credit.
 
(a)          In
addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse each Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and
expenses as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise
administering any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender.
 

57
 

 
(b)          Role
of Issuing Lender.  Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, an Issuing
Lender shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly
required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority
of the Person executing or delivering any such document.  None of the Issuing Lenders, the Administrative Agent, any
of their respective Agent Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any Issuing Lender shall be liable
to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Revolving Lenders
or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct
(as determined by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction); or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness,
validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document.  The Borrower
hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;
provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower’s pursuing
such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.  None
of the Issuing Lenders, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Agent Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant
or assignee of any Issuing Lender shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in Section 3.12; provided,
however, that anything in such Section to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against an Issuing
Lender, and an Issuing Lender may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to
consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which were caused by such Issuing Lender’s willful misconduct
or gross negligence or such Issuing Lender’s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to
it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit
(in each case, as determined by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction).  In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, an Issuing Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and an Issuing Lender shall
not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign
a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid
or ineffective for any reason.  An Issuing Lender may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from
the beneficiary via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”) message or overnight
courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary.
 
(c)          Applicability
of ISP and UCP.  Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the relevant Issuing Lender and the Borrower when a Letter
of Credit is issued, (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the UCP shall
apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Issuing Lender shall not be responsible
to the Borrower for, and such Issuing Lender’s rights and remedies against the Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action
or inaction of such Issuing Lender required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be
applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where such Issuing Lender or
the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements,
or official commentary of the ICC Banking
 

58
 

 
Commission, the Bankers
Association for Finance and Trade – International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International
Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice.
 
3.10        L/C
Participations.  (a)  Each Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant,
and, to induce the Issuing Lenders to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and
purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from the Issuing Lenders, on the terms and conditions set forth below, for such L/C
Participant’s own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant’s Revolving Percentage in the
Issuing Lenders’ obligations and rights (though, in the case of rights, subject to such L/C Participant’s satisfaction
of its reimbursement obligation set forth in the following sentence) under and in respect of each Letter of Credit issued hereunder
and the amount of each draft paid by the Issuing Lenders thereunder.  Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably
agrees with each Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed
in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent
upon demand of such Issuing Lender an amount equal to such L/C Participant’s Revolving Percentage of the amount of such
draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed.  The L/C Participants’ obligations to make such payment
shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to
payment that any L/C Participant may have or have had against an Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person.  The
Administrative Agent shall promptly forward such amounts to such Issuing Lender.
 
(a)          If
any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to the Administrative Agent for the account of an Issuing Lender pursuant
to Section 3.10(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit
is paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender within three (3) Business Days after the date such payment
is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender on demand an amount equal
to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Rate during the period from and including the date
such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Lender, times (iii) a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360.  If
any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.10(a) is not made available to the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three (3) Business Days after the date such payment
is due, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon
calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans under the Revolving Facility.  A certificate
of an Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive
in the absence of manifest error.
 
(b)          Whenever,
at any time after an Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its pro
rata share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.10(a), the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender receives
any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise,
 

59
 

 
including proceeds of
collateral applied thereto by such Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, the Administrative Agent or
such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, will distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share thereof; provided,
however, that in the event that any such payment received by Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender, as the case may
be, shall be required to be returned by the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by the Administrative Agent
or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, to it.
 
3.11        Reimbursement
Obligation of the Borrower.  An Issuing Lender shall notify the Borrower of the date and amount of a draft presented
under any Letter of Credit and paid by such Issuing Lender.  The Borrower agrees to reimburse such Issuing Lender for
the amount of (a) such draft so paid and (b) any fees, charges or other costs or expenses (other than taxes or similar amounts)
incurred by such Issuing Lender in connection with such payment on the Business Day after the Borrower receives such notice.  Each
such payment shall be made to such Issuing Lender at its address for notices referred to herein in Dollars and in immediately
available funds.  Interest shall be payable on any such amounts from the date on which the relevant draft is paid until
payment in full at the rate set forth in (i) until the Business Day next succeeding the date of the relevant notice, Section 4.5(b)
in respect of Revolving Loans and (ii) thereafter, Section 4.5(c).  Each drawing under any Letter of Credit shall (unless
an event of the type described in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 9.1(f) shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the
Borrower, in which case the procedures specified in Section 3.10 for funding by L/C Participants shall apply) constitute a request
by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for a borrowing pursuant to Section 3.2 of Base Rate Loans (or, at the option of the
Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender in their sole discretion, a borrowing pursuant to Section 3.4 of Swingline Loans)
in the amount of such drawing.  The Borrowing Date with respect to such borrowing shall be the first date on which a
borrowing of Revolving Loans (or, if applicable, Swingline Loans) could be made, pursuant to Section 3.2 (or, if applicable, Section
3.4), if the Administrative Agent had received a notice of such borrowing at the time the Administrative Agent receives notice
from an Issuing Lender of such drawing under such Letter of Credit.
 
3.12        Obligations
Absolute.  The Borrower’s obligations under Section 3.11 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and
all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower may have or have had against
an Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person.  The Borrower also agrees with the Issuing
Lenders that the Issuing Lenders and any Issuing Lender’s Agent Related Parties shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower’s
Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.11 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents
or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute
between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may
be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee.  No
Issuing Lender or any Agent Related Party of any Issuing Lender shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay
in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit,
except for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court
 

60
 

 
of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender or its Agent Related Parties, as applicable.  The
parties hereto agree that any action taken or omitted by an Issuing Lender or its Agent Related Parties under or in connection
with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of their respective gross negligence or willful
misconduct (as determined by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction), shall be binding on the
Borrower and the parties hereto and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender or its Agent Related Parties to the
Borrower.
 
3.13        Letter
of Credit Payments.  If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing
Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower of the date of payment and amount paid by such Issuing Lender in respect thereof.  The
responsibility of an Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit
shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, and subject to the limitations on
liability set forth in Section 3.9(c) and 3.12 hereof, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered
under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are substantially in conformity with such Letter of Credit.
 
3.14        Applications;
Issuer Documents.  To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent
with the provisions of this Section 3, the provisions of this Section 3 shall apply.  In the event of any conflict between
the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control.
 
3.15        Defaulting
Lenders.  (a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes
a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable
law:
 
(i)          Such
Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall
be restricted as set forth in the final paragraph of Section 11.1.
 
(ii)         Any
payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender
(whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article 9 or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from
a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.7 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative
Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;
second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Lender or Swingline
Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders’ Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting
Lender in accordance with Section 3.15(b); fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default
exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required
by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower, to be held in a deposit
 

61
 

 
account and released
pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under
this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders’ future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender
with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 3.15(b); sixth, to the
payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders or Swingline Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lenders against such Defaulting Lender as a result
of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event
of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under
this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided
that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or Letter of Credit disbursements in respect of which
such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit
were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 6.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely
to pay the Loans of, and Letter of Credit disbursements owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being
applied to the payment of any Loans of, or Letter of Credit disbursements owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all
Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance
with the Commitments under the applicable Facility without giving effect to Section 3.15(a)(iv).  Any payments, prepayments
or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or
to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 3.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender,
and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 
(iii)        No
Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender
(and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such Commitment Fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid
to that Defaulting Lender).
 
(iv)        Each
Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive L/C Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to
the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral
pursuant to Section 3.15(b); provided that with respect to any L/C Fee not required to be paid pursuant to this Section 3.15(a)(iv),
the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such L/C Fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting
Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting
Lender pursuant to clause (v) below, (y) pay to each Issuing Lender the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting
Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Lender’s Fronting
 

62
 

 
Exposure to such
Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.
 
(v)         All
or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans shall be reallocated among the
Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting
Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure
of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Commitment.  Subject to Section 11.18,
no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender
arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such
Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.
 
(vi)        If
the reallocation described in clause (v) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, within two Business
Days following the written request of the Administrative Agent or any Swingline Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent),
without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount
equal to the Swingline Lenders’ Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders’ Fronting
Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.15(b).
 
(b)          At
any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within three Business Days following the written request of the Administrative
Agent or any Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders’
Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 3.15(a)(v) and any Cash Collateral
provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount:
 
(i)          The
Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent,
for the benefit of the Issuing Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral
as security for the Defaulting Lenders’ obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations, to be applied pursuant
to clause (ii) below.  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right
or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lenders as herein provided (other than Lien permitted
pursuant to Section 8.3), or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower
will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in
an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).
 

63
 

 
(ii)         Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 3.15(b) in respect of Letters
of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender’s obligation to fund participations in respect of
L/C Obligations (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for
which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
 
(iii)        Cash
Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce any Issuing Lender’s Fronting Exposure shall no longer
be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 3.15(b) following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting
Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the
Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender that there exists excess Cash Collateral.
 
(c)          If
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender agree in writing that a Lender is no longer
a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in
such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral),
that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such
other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations
in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable
Facility (without giving effect to Section 3.15(a)(v), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided
that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while
that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed
by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim
of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
(d)          So
long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless it
is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swingline Loan and (ii) no Issuing Lender shall
be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure
after giving effect thereto.
 
3.16        Incremental
Revolving Commitments.
 
(a)          Borrower
Request.  The Borrower may at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date by written notice to the Administrative
Agent elect to request the establishment of one or more new revolving credit facilities (each, an “Incremental Revolving
Facility”) with new revolving commitments or an increase to the existing Revolving Commitments (each, an “Incremental
Revolving Commitment”) in an aggregate principal amount when combined with the aggregate amount of all Incremental Term
Loan Commitments under Section 2.4 and all Incremental Equivalent Debt under Section 2.5, not in excess of the
 

64
 

 
Available Incremental
Amount.  Each such notice shall specify (i) the date (each, a “Revolving Commitment Increase Effective Date”)
on which the Borrower proposes that the Incremental Revolving Commitment shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than
ten (10) Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such earlier date as the
Administrative Agent shall agree in its sole discretion) and (ii) the identity of each Person (which, if not a Lender, an Approved
Fund or an Affiliate of a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender) to whom
the Borrower proposes any portion of such Incremental Revolving Commitment be allocated and the amounts of such allocations.
 
(b)          Conditions.  The
Incremental Revolving Commitment shall become effective as of such Revolving Commitment Increase Effective Date; provided
that:
 
(i)          each
of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(c) and 6.2(d) shall be satisfied (except as otherwise set forth in the applicable Increase
Revolving Joinder);
 
(ii)         Each
of the representations and warranties made by any Loan Party in or pursuant to the Loan Documents shall be true and correct in
all material respects on and as of such date as if made on and as of such date (except to the extent made as of a specific date,
in which case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such specific date);
provided that, if the primary purpose of such Incremental Revolving Facility is to finance a Permitted Acquisition or an
Investment permitted under Section 8.7, the foregoing shall be limited to the Specified Representations (other than Section 5.19
with respect to the target in such Permitted Acquisition and its subsidiaries);
 
(iii)        no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result from the borrowings to be made on the Revolving
Commitment Increase Effective Date (except as otherwise set forth in the applicable Increase Revolving Joinder); provided
that, if the primary purpose of such Incremental Revolving Facility is to finance a Permitted Acquisition or an Investment permitted
under Section 8.7, then the foregoing shall be limited to no Specified Event of Default; and
 
(iv)        the
Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered any customary legal opinions or other documents reasonably requested by the Administrative
Agent in connection with any such transaction.
 
(c)          Terms
of Incremental Revolving Loans and Incremental Revolving Commitments.  The terms and provisions of the Incremental
Revolving Commitments and the Loans made pursuant to the Incremental Revolving Commitments (the “Incremental Revolving
Loans”) shall be as follows:
 
(i)          such
terms and provisions shall be on the same terms and subject to the same documentation applicable to the existing Revolving Facility
(except as otherwise set forth herein) (it being understood that Incremental Revolving
 

65
 

 
Loans may be
part of the existing tranche of Revolving Loans or may comprise one or more new tranches of Revolving Loans);
 
(ii)         the
maturity date of Incremental Revolving Loans shall not be earlier than the Revolver Termination Date;
 
(iii)        any
Incremental Revolving Loan shall have no scheduled amortization or mandatory commitment reduction prior to the Revolving Termination
Date;
 
(iv)        the
applicable yield for the Incremental Revolving Loans shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable new Lenders; and
 
(v)         Incremental
Revolving Loans may, at the Borrower’s discretion, rank pari passu in right of payment and security with other Loans
or, subject to Section 8.2(p), may be incurred as Junior Indebtedness (including Second Lien Indebtedness); provided that
any Incremental Revolving Loans secured on a pari passu basis with the existing Loans shall be incurred pursuant to the
Loan Documents.
 
Incremental Revolving
Loans may be provided by any existing Lender (but no existing Lender shall have an obligation to make any Incremental Revolving
Commitment, nor will the Borrower have any obligation to approach any existing Lenders to provide any Incremental Revolving Commitment)
and additional banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders who will become Lenders in connection with such Incremental
Term Facility; provided that the consent of the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender (in each
case not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be required with respect to any additional Lender to the same
extent such consent would for an assignment of an existing Loan to such Lender pursuant to Section 11.6(b).  The Incremental
Revolving Commitments shall be effected by a joinder agreement (the “Increase Revolving Joinder”) executed
by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender making such Incremental Revolving Commitment, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to each of them.  Incremental Revolving Loans may be used for the Borrower’s and its Subsidiaries’
general corporate purposes, including any transaction not prohibited under this Agreement.  The Increase Revolving Joinder
may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be
necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 3.16.  In
addition, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all references in the Loan Documents to Revolving Commitments and Revolving
Loans shall be deemed, unless the context otherwise requires, to include references to Incremental Revolving Commitments and Incremental
Revolving Loans that are made pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(d)          Equal
and Ratable Benefit.  The Incremental Revolving Loans and Incremental Revolving Commitments established pursuant
to this Section 3.16 shall constitute Loans and Commitments under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by, this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, if secured, in any case, shall benefit equally
and ratably from security interests created by the Security
 

66
 

 
Documents and the guarantees
of the Subsidiary Guarantors.  The Loan Parties shall take any actions reasonably required by the Administrative Agent
to ensure and/or demonstrate that the Lien and security interests granted by the Security Documents continue to be perfected under
the Uniform Commercial Code or otherwise after giving effect to the establishment of any such Class of Incremental Revolving Loans
or any such Incremental Revolving Commitments.
 
SECTION 4.    GENERAL
PROVISIONS APPLICABLE
TO LOANS AND LETTERS OF
CREDIT
 
4.1          Optional
Prepayments.  (a)  The Borrower may at any time and from time to time prepay the Loans, in whole or in
part, without premium or penalty, upon irrevocable notice delivered to the Administrative Agent no later than 12:00 Noon, New
York City time, three (3) Business Days prior thereto, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, and no later than 12:00 Noon, New
York City time, one (1) Business Day prior thereto, in the case of Base Rate Loans, which notice shall specify the date and amount
of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurodollar Loans or Base Rate Loans and if such payment is to be applied to prepay
the Term Loans, the manner in which such prepayment is to be applied thereto (and if not specified such prepayment shall be applied
to Term Loans in direct order of maturity thereof); provided, that if a Eurodollar Loan is prepaid on any day other than
the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to Section 4.11;
provided, further that such notice may be contingent on the occurrence of a refinancing or the consummation of a
sale, transfer, lease or other disposition of assets and may be revoked or the termination date deferred if the refinancing or
sale, transfer, lease or other disposition of assets does not occur.  Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof.  If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such
notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with (except in the case of Revolving Loans that are Base
Rate Loans and Swingline Loans) accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid.  Partial prepayments of Eurodollar
Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof.  Partial
prepayments of Base Rate Loans (other than Swingline Loans) shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $500,000 or integral
multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof.  Partial prepayments of Swingline Loans shall be in an aggregate principal
amount of $100,000 or integral multiples of $50,000 in excess thereof
 
(a)          Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that, on or prior to the date which is twelve months after the Closing Date (i) a Repricing Event occurs,
the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each of the applicable Term B Lenders, a prepayment
premium of 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Closing Date Term B Loans prepaid, refinanced, substituted or replaced
pursuant to such Repricing Event and (ii) any Lender becomes a Non-Consenting Lender in respect of an amendment to the Loan Documents
that would reduce the all-in yield applicable to Term B Loans and such Lender’s Term B Loans are assigned pursuant to the
Non-Consenting Lender provisions of Section 11.1, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender for its own account a fee equal to 1.00%
of the aggregate principal amount of the Closing Date Term B Loans so assigned.  Such amounts shall be due and payable
on the date of effectiveness of such Repricing Event or assignment, as applicable.
 

67
 

 
4.2          Mandatory
Prepayments.  (a)  If any Indebtedness or Disqualified Capital Stock shall be incurred or issued by the
Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary after the Closing Date (other than Excluded Indebtedness but excluding any Replacement Facility),
an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds thereof shall be applied on the date of such incurrence or issuance toward the
prepayment of the Loans as set forth in Section 4.2(d).
 
(a)          If
on any date the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary shall receive Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset Sale or Recovery Event then,
unless a Reinvestment Notice shall be delivered in respect thereof, such Net Cash Proceeds shall be applied on such date toward
the prepayment of the Loans as set forth in Section 4.2(d); provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, on each Reinvestment
Prepayment Date, an amount equal to the Reinvestment Prepayment Amount with respect to the relevant Reinvestment Event shall be
applied toward the prepayment of the Loans as set forth in Section 4.2(d).
 
(b)          The
Borrower shall, on each Excess Cash Flow Application Date commencing with the Excess Cash Flow Application Date applicable to the
fiscal year of the Borrower ending October 1, 2017, apply the ECF Percentage of the excess, if any, of (i) Excess Cash Flow for
the related Excess Cash Flow Payment Period minus (ii) Voluntary Prepayments and open market or Dutch Auction purchases of Term
Loans pursuant to Section 11.6(j) to the extent of cash payments by the Borrower in connection therewith, in each case made during
such Excess Cash Flow Payment Period or, without giving duplicative effect to any of the foregoing amounts, during the period following
such Excess Cash Flow Payment Period but prior to the Excess Cash Flow Application Date, toward the prepayment of the Loans as
set forth in Section 4.2(d).  Except as provided below, each such prepayment and commitment reduction shall be made on
a date (an “Excess Cash Flow Application Date”) no later than ten (10) days after the date on which the financial
statements referred to in Section 7.1(a) for the fiscal year of the Borrower with respect to which such prepayment is made are
required to be delivered to the Lenders.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower will not be required to prepay
the Loans pursuant to this clause (c) with respect to any Excess Cash Flow for the related Excess Cash Flow Payment Period attributable
to a Foreign Subsidiary if the repatriation of such Excess Cash Flow from such Foreign Subsidiary at any time during the fiscal
year in which such Excess Cash Flow Application Date occurs would cause material adverse consequences from fees, taxes or similar
impositions of Governmental Authorities to the Borrower or would otherwise be payable as a result of the occurrence of any one-time
repatriation holidays; provided that in the event the Borrower is required to make a payment of Excess Cash Flow attributable to
a Foreign Subsidiary, such payment shall be made no later than ten (10) days after the Borrower becomes aware that such repatriation
would not cause adverse consequences from fees, taxes or similar impositions of Governmental Authorities to the Borrower; provided
further that in the event that the Borrower is not required to make a payment of Excess Cash Flow attributable to a Foreign Subsidiary
during the fiscal year in which such Excess Cash Flow Application Date occurs, no payment shall be due in any succeeding fiscal
year.
 
(c)          Amounts
to be applied in connection with prepayments made pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be applied, without premium or penalty, as
follows:
 
(i)          in
the case of a prepayment pursuant to Section 4.2(c), first, to the prepayment of the Term B Loans in accordance with Section
4.8 and, second, to
 

68
 

 
the prepayment
of the Term A Loans in accordance with Section 4.8, third to prepay the Revolving Loans without any permanent reduction
of the Revolving Commitments, in each case on a pro rata basis;
 
(ii)         in
the case of a prepayment pursuant to Section 4.2(a) (other than any prepayment resulting from a Replacement Facility) or (b), first,
to the prepayment on a pro rata basis of the Term A Loans and the Term B Loans, in each case in accordance with Section 4.8 and,
second to prepay the Revolving Loans without any permanent reduction of the Revolving Commitments, in each case on a pro
rata basis and in the case of a prepayment resulting from a Replacement Facility to the applicable Term Loans being replaced,
 
provided that,
in the case of prepayments of Revolving Loans, if the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans then outstanding
is less than the amount of such excess (because L/C Obligations constitute a portion thereof), the Borrower shall, to the extent
of the balance of such excess, replace outstanding Letters of Credit and/or deposit an amount in cash in a cash collateral account
established with the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent; provided, further, that if a Eurodollar Loan is prepaid on any day other than the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to Section 4.11.  The
application of any prepayment pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be made, first, to Base Rate Loans and, second,
to Eurodollar Loans.  Each prepayment of the Loans under this Section 4.2 shall be accompanied by accrued interest to
the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid.
 
(d)          Each
Term Lender may elect may elect, by notice to the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by hand delivery, facsimile transmission
or PDF attachment to an e-mail) at least one Business Day prior to the required prepayment date, to decline all or any portion
of any mandatory prepayment pursuant to this Section 4.2 of its Loans (such declined prepayment amounts, “Declined
Prepayments”) other than any prepayment from the proceeds of any Replacement Facility, in which case the such Declined
Prepayments shall be retained by the Borrower.
 
(e)          In
addition to, and without reduction to, each of the prepayments required pursuant to this Section 4.2, not later than 30 days following
the Closing Date the Borrower shall prepay Revolving Loans (without requiring any permanent reduction to the Revolving Commitments)
in an amount equal to the amount by which the Transaction Costs Revolving Amount exceeds $225.0 million.
 
4.3          Conversion
and Continuation Options.  (a)  The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to
Base Rate Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election, which may be given by (A) telephone,
or (B) a Committed Loan Notice (provided that any telephone notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Administrative
Agent of a Committed Loan Notice) no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the Business Day preceding the proposed conversion
date; provided that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with
respect thereto.  The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving
the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election
 

69
 

 
which may be given by (A) telephone, or
(B) a Committed Loan Notice (provided that any telephone notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Administrative
Agent of a Committed Loan Notice) no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding the proposed
conversion date (which notice shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor); provided that no Base Rate
Loan under a particular Facility may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
and the Administrative Agent has or the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of such Facility have determined in its or their sole
discretion not to permit such conversions.  Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
each relevant Lender thereof.
 
(a)          Any
Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower
giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term “Interest
Period” set forth in Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans; provided
that no Eurodollar Loan under a particular Facility may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
and the Administrative Agent has or the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of such Facility have determined in its or their sole
discretion not to permit such continuations; and provided, further, that if the Borrower shall fail to give any required
notice as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso such Loans
shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period.  Upon receipt
of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof.
 
4.4          Limitations
on Eurodollar Tranches.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions
and continuations of Eurodollar Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and
be made pursuant to such elections so that, (a) after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar
Loans comprising each Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal to $1,000,000 or integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof and
(b) no more than ten (10) Eurodollar Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time.
 
4.5          Interest
Rates and Payment Dates.  (a)  Each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest
Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin.
 
(a)          Each
Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to th

of such election until such Event of Default is no longer continuing; provided that the foregoing
interest rate shall apply automatically, without
 

70
 

 
any election of the Required
Lenders, in the case of any Event of Default under Section 9.1(a) with respect to a payment of principal only, or Section 9.1(f).
 
(c)          Interest
shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date; provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of
this Section shall be payable from time to time on demand.
 
(d)          Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall
not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the “Maximum
Rate”).  If any Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate,
the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower.  In
determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person
may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium
rather than interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread
in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.
 
4.6          Computation
of Interest and Fees; Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent; Obligations of Lenders Several.  (a)  Interest
and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that,
with respect to Base Rate Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the basis of clause (a) or (b) of the definition
of Base Rate, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual
days elapsed.  The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of
each determination of a Eurodollar Rate.  Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Base
Rate or the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change
becomes effective.  The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders
of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.
 
(a)          Each
determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and
binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error.  The Administrative Agent shall, at the request
of the Borrower, promptly deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining
any interest rate pursuant to Section 4.6(a).
 
(b)          If
any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing
provisions of this Section 4, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions
to the applicable extension of credit set forth in Section 6 are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the
Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
 

71
 

 
(c)          The
obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans and Revolving Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline
Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.7 and 10.12 are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to
make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.7 or 10.12 on any date required hereunder
shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for
the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.7 or
10.12.
 
4.7          Inability
to Determine Interest Rate.  If prior to the first day of any Interest Period:
 
(a)          the
Administrative Agent shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that,
by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar
Rate for such Interest Period, or
 
(b)          the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of the relevant Facility that the
Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Lenders (as reasonably determined and conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during
such Interest Period,
 
the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy
or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter but at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period.  If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans under the relevant
Facility requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as Base Rate Loans, (y) any Loans under the
relevant Facility that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued
as Base Rate Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility shall be converted, on the last day of
the then-current Interest Period, to Base Rate Loans.  Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent
(which notice the Administrative Agent agrees to withdraw promptly upon a determination that the condition or situation which gave
rise to such notice no longer exists), no further Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility shall be made or continued as such,
nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans under the relevant Facility to Eurodollar Loans.
 
4.8          Pro
Rata Treatment; Application of Payments; Payments.  (a)  Except as set forth in Section 4.13, each borrowing
by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of any commitment fee and any reduction of
the Commitments of the Lenders shall be made pro rata according to the respective Term A Percentages, Term B Percentages
or Revolving Percentages, as the case may be, of the relevant Lenders.
 
(a)          Except
as set forth in Section 4.13, each payment (including each prepayment) on account of principal of and interest on the Term Loans
shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Term Loans then held by the
 

72
 

 
Term Lenders.  Except
as expressly set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, the amount of each principal prepayment of the Term Loans shall be applied to reduce
the then remaining installments of the Term Loans pro rata based upon the then remaining principal amount thereof.  Amounts
repaid or prepaid on account of the Term Loans may not be reborrowed.
 
(b)          Each
payment (including each prepayment) on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans shall be made pro rata
according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Loans then held by the Revolving Lenders.
 
(c)          All
payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise,
shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof
to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds.  The
Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received.  If
any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day,
such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.  If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due
and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless
the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be
made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to
the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
 
(d)          Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make
the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may (but shall
not be required to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such
amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall
pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal
Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent.  A
certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  If such Lender’s share of such borrowing is not made available to
the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also
be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant
Facility, on demand, from the Borrower.
 
(e)          Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by
the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume
that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Lenders their
 

73
 

 
respective pro
rata shares of a corresponding amount.  If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower
within three (3) Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each
Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the
rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the
rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.
 
(f)          Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions of this Section 4.8 shall be subject to the express provisions of this
Agreement which require or permit differing payments to be made to Non-Defaulting Lenders as opposed to Defaulting Lenders.
 
4.9          Requirements
of Law.  (a)  If any Change in Law shall:
 
(i)          impose,
modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets
of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected
in the Eurodollar Rate) or any Issuing Lender;
 
(i)          subject
any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition
of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations,
or its deposits, reserves

lities or capital attributable thereto; or
 
(ii)         impose
on any Lender or any Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting
this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing
shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan
or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, such Issuing Lender or such other
Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in
or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, Issuing Lender or
other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, Issuing Lender
or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, Issuing Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, Issuing Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs
incurred or reduction suffered.  
 
(b)          If
any Lender or Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or Issuing Lender or any lending office of
such Lender or such Lender’s or Issuing Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements,
has or
 

74
 

 
would have the effect
of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or Issuing Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s
or Issuing Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans
made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by any
Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Lender or such Lender’s or Issuing Lender’s holding
company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or Issuing Lender’s
policies and the policies of such Lender’s or Issuing Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then
from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender or such Lender’s or Issuing Lender’s holding company for any such
reduction suffered.
 
(c)          A
certificate of a Lender or Issuing Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender
or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the
Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case
may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
(d)          Failure
or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver
of such Lender’s or Issuing Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not
be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered
more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender’s or Issuing Lender’s intention to claim
compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).  Increased
costs because of a Change in Law resulting from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Basel III may
only be requested by a Lender imposing such increased costs on borrowers similarly situated to the Borrowers under syndicated credit
facilities comparable to those provided hereunder.
 
4.10        Taxes.  (a)  For
purposes of this Section 4.10, the term “Lender” includes any Issuing Lender and the term “applicable law”
includes FATCA.
 
(a)          Any
and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or
withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith
discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding
Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full
amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified
Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding
has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the
 

75
 

 
applicable Recipient
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
 
(b)          The
Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative
Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
 
(c)          The
Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including
Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient
or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A
certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the reason for and amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower
by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender,
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(d)          Each
Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes
attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for
such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s
failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.6(f) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded
Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan
Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes
the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise
payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under
this paragraph (e).
 
(f)          As
soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 4.10, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing
such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.
 
(e)          (i)          Any
Lender (including solely for purposes of this subparagraph (i) and Section 4.10(i) each Agent) that is entitled to an exemption
from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed
and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be
made without
 

76
 

 
withholding or
at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding
or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the
completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 4.10(g)(ii)(A),
(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission
would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position
of such Lender.
 
(ii)         Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Borrower,
 



(A)         any
    Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which
    such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the
    Borrower or the Administrative Agent), properly completed and duly executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such
    Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;

 



(B)         any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in
such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender
under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent),
whichever of the following is applicable:

 

(1)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United
States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, properly completed and duly executed copies
of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant
to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document,
properly completed and duly executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN  or W-8BEN-E (as applicable) establishing an exemption
from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits,” “other income”
or other article of such tax treaty;
 

77
 

 

(2)properly completed and duly executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI
 

(3)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under
Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is
not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the
Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in
Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) properly completed and duly executed
copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (as applicable); or
 

(4)to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, properly completed and duly executed
copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by properly completed and duly executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E
(as applicable), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-2 or Exhibit D-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or
other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership
and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign
Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-4 on behalf of each such direct and
indirect partner.
 



(C)         any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in
such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender
under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent),
properly completed and duly executed copies of any other form or document prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming
exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed
by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be
made; and

 

78
 

 



(D)         if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender
were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b)
of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed
by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed
by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply
with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA
or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA”
shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

 
(f)          If
any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it
has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 4.10 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section
4.10), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made
under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of
such indemnified party related to such refund and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority
with 

ng anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be
required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified
party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification
and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional
amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified
party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying
party or any other Person.
 
(g)          Each
Lender agrees that if any documentation it previously delivered pursuant to Section 4.10(g) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate
in any respect, it shall update such documentation or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its
legal ineligibility to do so.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.10, a Lender shall not be required
to deliver any documentation pursuant to Section 4.10(g) or this paragraph (i) that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver.
 
(h)          Each
party’s obligations under this Section 4.10 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any
assignment of rights by, or the
 

79
 

 
replacement of, a Lender,
the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
 
4.11        Indemnity.  The
Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold each Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense that such Lender may
sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of
Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement,
(b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice
thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (c) the making of a prepayment of, or a conversion from, Eurodollar
Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto or (d) any other default by the Borrower in
the repayment of such Eurodollar Loans when and as required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  Such indemnification
may include an amount (other than with respect to clause (d)) equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that
would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such
prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure
to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the
applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if
any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such
amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market.  A
certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in
the absence of manifest error.  This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the
Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  This Section 4.11 shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any
Tax that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.
 
4.12        Change
of Lending Office.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 4.9, or requires the Borrower to pay
any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant
to Section 4.10, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different
lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its
offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or
reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.9 or 4.10, as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject
such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
4.13        Replacement
of Lenders.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 4.9, or if the Borrower is required to pay any
Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 4.10 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance
with Section 4.12, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, (i) prepay such
Lender’s outstanding Term Loans in full on a non-pro rata basis without premium or penalty, or (ii) at its sole expense
and effort,
 

80
 

 
upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative
Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained
in, and consents required by, Section 11.6), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant
to Section 4.9 or Section 4.10) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that
shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that,
in the case of an assignment:
 
(a)          the
Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 11.6;
 
(b)          such
Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in Letter of
Credit disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 4.11) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued
interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
 
(c)          in
the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 4.9 or payments required to be made
pursuant to Section 4.10, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
 
(d)          such
assignment does not conflict with applicable law; and
 
(e)          in
the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented
to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.
 
A Lender shall not be
required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  
 
4.14        Evidence
of Debt.  (a)  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts
evidencing indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan of such Lender from time to time, including the
amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.
 
(a)          The
Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Borrower (or, in the case of an assignment not required to be recorded in the Register in
accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6(d), the assigning Lender, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent
of the Borrower), shall maintain the Register (or, in the case of an assignment not required to be recorded in the Register in
accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6(d), a Related Party Register), in each case pursuant to Section 11.6(d), and a subaccount
therein for each Lender, in which shall be recorded the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal
amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to
time.
 

81
 

 
(b)          The
Borrower agrees that, upon the request to the Administrative Agent by any Lender, the Borrower will execute and deliver to such
Lender a promissory note of the Borrower evidencing any Term A Loans, Term B Loans, Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans, as the
case may be, of such Lender, substantially in the forms of Exhibit E-1, E-2 E-3 or E-4 respectively, with appropriate insertions
as to date and principal amount.
 
4.15        Illegality.  Notwithstanding
any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application
thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the
commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and convert Base Rate Loans to
Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be canceled and (b) such Lender’s Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall
be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to
such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law.  If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on
a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender
such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 4.11.

Change.  Since September 27, 2015, there has been no development or event that has had or could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
5.3          Corporate
Existence; Compliance with Law.  Except as permitted under Section 8.4, the Borrower and each Restricted Subsidiary
(a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the

Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party) or clauses (b) through (e) to comply therewith could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
5.4          Power;
Authorization; Enforceable Obligations.  Each Loan Party has the organizational power and authority, and the legal
right, to make, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to obtain extensions

delivery and performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to authorize the extensions
of credit on the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or

or otherwise impose adverse conditions on the Transactions, other than any such consent, authorizations, filings and notices the
absence of which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Eff

5.19.  Each Loan Document has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of each Loan Party party thereto.  This
Agreement constitutes, and each other Loan Document upon execution will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of each
Loan Party party thereto, enforceable against each such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’
rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).
 
5.5          No
Legal Bar.  The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the issuance
of Letters of Credit, the borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate (a) its Organizational Document,
(b) any Requirement of Law, Governmental Authorization or any Contractual Obligation of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary
and (c) will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of their respective properties or revenues
pursuant to its Organizational Documents, any Requirement of Law or any such Contractual Obligation (other than the Liens created
by the Security Documents and the Liens permitted by Section 8.3), except for any violation set forth in clauses (b) or (c) which

of the Borrower, threatened in writing by or against the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or against any of their respective

5.6          No
Default.  Neither the Borrower nor any Restricted Subsidiary is in default under or with respect to any of its Contractual

to all of its owned real property, a valid leasehold interest in all its leased real property, and good title to, or a valid leasehold
interest in, license of, or right to use, all its other tangible Property material to its business, in all material respects,
and no such Property is subject to any Lien except as permitted by Section 8.3.  As of the Closing Date, no condemnation
has been commenced or, to the Borrower’s knowledge, is contemplated with respect to all or any portion of any real property
required to be pledged to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary.

Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete

or any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely

compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of
Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Lender, each Agent may presume that
such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuing Lender unless such Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from
such Lender or Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  Each Agent
may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it,

or experts.

hereunder unless such Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default
or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default”.  In the event that the Administrative
Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders.  The Administrative
Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required
Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or any other instructing group of Lenders specified by this Agreement);
provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may
(but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Secured Parties.
 
10.6        Non-Reliance

made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs
of a Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to
any Lender or any other Secured Party.

Secured Party) represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender or any
other Secured Party, and based on such

an Parties and their affiliates
and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement, any Specified Hedge Agreement or any Specified
Cash Management Agreement.  Each Lender (and, if applicable, each other Secured Party) also represents that it will,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender or any other Secured Party, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking
or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,  any Specified Hedge Agreement or any Specified
Cash Management Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates.  Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative
Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender or any other Secured Party with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party
or any Affiliate of a Loan Party that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.
 
10.7        Indemnification.  To
the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under Section 11.5 to be paid by it
to any Agent Related Party (or any sub-agent thereof), each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent Related Party (or any
such sub-agent thereof) such Lender’s Aggregate Exposure Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed
expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that (a) the unreimbursed expense or indemnified
loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against any Agent Related Party
(or any such sub-agent thereof) and (b) no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such unreimbursed expense
or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense that is found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court
of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The agreements
in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
10.8        Agent
in Its Individual Capacity.  Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally
engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an Agent and without any duty to account therefor
to the Lenders.  With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any Letter of Credit issued or
participated in by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any

Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint a successor agent for the Lenders (which such successor agent shall be
(x) a Lender or (y) otherwise satisfactory to the Required Lenders), which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under
Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.1(f) with respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by
the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the
rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the term “Administrative Agent”
or “Collateral Agent,” as applicable, shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval,
and the former Administrative Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s, as applicable, rights, powers and duties as Administrative
Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans.  If

become effective and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as
applicable, hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.  After

and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Section 10 and Section 11.5 shall continue in effect for the benefit
of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, their respective sub-agents and their respective Agent Related
Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent
was acting as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable.
 
(a)          Anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if at any time the Required Lenders determine that the Person serving as Administrative
Agent is a Defaulting Lender, the Required Lenders (determined after giving effect to the final paragraph of Section 11.1) may
by notice to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, in consultation with the Borrower, appoint
a replacement Administrative Agent hereunder.  Such removal will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
be effective on the earlier of (i) the date a replacement Administrative Agent is appointed and (ii) the date ten (10) Business
Days after the giving of such notice by the Required Lenders (regardless of whether a replacement Administrative Agent has been
appointed).
 
(b)          In
addition to the foregoing, if (i) a Lender becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Lender and/or
the Swingline Lender may, upon prior written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, resign as Issuing Lender or Swingline
Lender, respectively, effective at the close of business New York time on a date specified in such notice (which date may not be
less than ten (10) Business Days after the date of such notice) or (ii) Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. resigns or is removed
as Administrative Agent, such resignation or removal shall also constitute its resignation as Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender;
provided that such resignation by the Issuing Lender will have no effect on
 

129
 

 
the validity or enforceability
of any Letter of Credit then outstanding or on the obligations of the Borrower or any Lender under this Agreement with respect
to any such outstanding Letter of Credit or otherwise to the Issuing Lender and such Issuing Lender shall continue to be an Issuing
Lender for the purposes of this Agreement in respect of such Letters of Credit and that such resignation by the Swingline Lender
will have no effect on its rights in respect of any outstanding Swingline Loans or on the obligations of the Borrower or any Lender

lien or similar claim or other rights of self-help), or institute any actions or proceeds, or otherwise commence any remedial
procedures, with respect to any Collateral or any other property of any such Loan Party, without the prior written consent of
the Administrative Agent.  
 
10.12      Withholding
Taxes.  Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 4.10, each Lender shall indemnify the Administrative

therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements
of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the Internal Revenue
Service or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold tax from
amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or
not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered
the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective).  A certificate as to the amount of any such payment
or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender
hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document against any amounts due the Administrative Agent under this Section 10.12.  The agreements
in this Section 10.12 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights

in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is subject, (b) at any other sale or foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in
lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or
otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law.  In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations
owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect
to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that would vest upon
the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating
the contingent interests) in the asset or assets so purchased (or in the Capital Stock or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle

shall be authorized to
 

131
 

 
form one or more acquisition vehicles to
make a bid, (ii) to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions

this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in Section 11.1 of this
Agreement, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to assign the relevant Obligations to any such acquisition vehicle
pro rata by the Lenders, as a result of which each of the Lenders shall be deemed to have received a pro rata portion of any Capital

bid, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (iv) to the extent that
Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another
bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of debt credit
bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Lenders pro rata and the
Capital Stock and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of the Obligations that had been assigned to
the acquisition vehicle shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to
take any further action.

or more additional credit facilities with respect to Incremental Term Loans to this Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit
from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Term Loans, as applicable, and the accrued interest and fees in respect
thereof and (c) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders
and Majority Facility Lenders; provided, that the conditions set forth in Section 2.4 are satisfied.

is obligated to furnish to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, all notices,

the Issuing Lender materials and/or information provided by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder (collectively, “Borrower

Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of any Agent or any
Lender, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor

11.5        Payment
of Expenses and Taxes.  (a)  The Borrower agrees (i) to pay or reimburse each Agent for all its reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development, preparation and execution of, and
any amendment, supplement or modification to, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other documents prepared in
connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to such parties (provided that such fees and disbursements shall
not include fees and disbursements for more than one counsel plus one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction) and filing
and recording fees and expenses, with statements with respect to the foregoing to be submitted to the Borrower prior to the Closing
Date (in the case of amounts to be paid on the Closing Date) and from time to time thereafter as such parties shall deem appropriate,

you of the existence of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel, of one other firm of counsel for such affected Lender
or Agent, (iii) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and each Agent harmless from, any and all recording and filing fees and
any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying, stamp, excise and other taxes (other than amounts

of, or consummation or administration of any of the transactions contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or modification
of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, and
(iv) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender, Agent and their respective affiliates and each of the respective officers, directors,

139
 

 
enforcement, performance and administration
of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents (regardless of whether any Loan Party is or is not a party to any such actions or suits)
and any such other documents, including any of the foregoing relating to the use of proceeds of the Loans or the violation of,
noncompliance with or liability under, any Environmental Law applicable to the operations of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary
or any of the Properties and the reasonable fees and expenses of a single firm of legal counsel, and, if necessary, one firm of
local counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction (which may include a single special counsel acting in multiple jurisdictions), in
connection with claims, actions or proceedings by any Indemnitee against any Loan Party under any Loan Document (all the foregoing
in this clause (iv), collectively, the “Indemnified Liabilities”);
provided, that no Indemnitee will be indemnified for any Indemnified Liabilities to the extent (a) it has been determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment to have resulted from (i) the gross negligence, bad faith
or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (ii) a material breach of the obligations of such Indemnitee under the Loan Documents
or (b) any proceeding between and among Indemnitees that do not involve an act or omission by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries
(other than claims against the Administrative Agent or a Lead Arranger in its capacity or in fulfilling its role as the agent or
arranger or any other similar role under the Facilities (excluding its role as a Lender)); provided further, that,
this Section 11.5 shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising
from any non-Tax claim.  Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower
agrees not to assert and to cause its Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby waives and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to waive,
all rights for contribution or any other rights of recovery with respect to all claims, demands, penalties, fines, liabilities,
settlements, damages, costs and expenses of whatever kind or nature, under or related to Environmental Laws, that any of them might
have by statute or otherwise against any Indemnitee except to the extent found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court
of competent jurisdiction to have resulted primarily from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.  Statements
payable by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall be submitted to John Hohener, at the address of the Borrower set forth
in Section 11.2, or to such other Person or address as may be hereafter designated by the Borrower in a written notice to the Administrative
Agent.  The agreements in this Section 11.5 shall survive repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
(a)          To
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, neither the Borrower nor any Indemnitee shall assert, and each of the Borrower
and each Indemnitee does hereby waive, any claim against any party hereto, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential
or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any
Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof; provided that the foregoing shall not limit any Loan Party’s
indemnity obligations to the extent special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages are included in any third party claim
in connection with which such Indemnitee is entitled to receive indemnification hereunder.  No Indemnitee shall be liable
for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications,
electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.  
 

140
 

 
(b)          All
amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten (10) days after demand therefor.  
 
11.6        Successors
and Assigns; Participations and Assignments.  (a)  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any affiliate
of an Issuing Lender that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any
of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender (and any
attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or
otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except (w) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs
(b) or (c) of this Section, (x) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this Section or
(y) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of paragraph (h) of this Section or (z)
by a Conduit Lender to its designating Lender in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (i) of this Section (and any other
attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors as assigns permitted
hereby, Participants to the extent provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 11.6 and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby,
the Affiliates of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement.
 
(a)          Any
Lender may assign to one or more assignees (each, an “Assignee”) all
or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans at
the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
 
(i)          except
in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, an assignment effected by the Administrative
Agent in connection with the initial syndication of the Commitments or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning
Lender’s Commitments or Loans under any Facility, the amount of the Commitments or Loans of the assigning Lender subject
to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to
the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall
not be less than $5,000,000 (or, in the case of a Term Facility, $1,000,000) unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent otherwise consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that no such consent of the
Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
 
(ii)         each
partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations
under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit any Lender
from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate tranches of Loans (if any) on a non-pro rata basis;
 

141
 

 
(iii)        no
consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by paragraph (b)(i) of this Section and, in addition,
the consent of:
 
(A)         the
Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing at the time of such assignment, (y) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund;
provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written
notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received notice thereof or (z) such assignment is
an assignment of Term Loans or Commitments made by the Administrative Agent prior to the Syndication Date; and
 
(B)         the
Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of
(x) either Term Facility if such assignment is to an Assignee that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund
or (y) the Revolving Facility if such assignment is to an Assignee that is not a Lender with a Revolving Commitment, an Affiliate
of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender; and
 
(C)         (1)
in the case of any assignment to a new Revolving Lender or that increases the obligation of the Assignee to participate in exposure
under one or more Letters of Credit (whether or not then outstanding), the Issuing Lenders (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and (2) in the case of any assignment of a Revolving Commitment, the Swingline Lender (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that no consent of an Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender shall be required
for an assignment to an Assignee that is a Revolving Lender or an Affiliate or Approved Fund of a Revolving Lender;
 
(iv)        except
in the case of assignments pursuant to paragraph (c) below, the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (it being understood that payment
of only one processing fee shall be required in connection with simultaneous assignments to two or more Approved Funds), and the
Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire;
 
(v)         no
assignment shall be permitted to be made to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries except pursuant to a Dutch Auction as provided
in Section 11.6(j); and
 
(vi)        no
assignment shall be permitted to be made to a natural person.
 

142
 

 
Except as otherwise
provided in paragraph (c) below, subject to acceptance and recording thereof in the Register pursuant to paragraph (d) below, from
and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under
this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption,
be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning
Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.9, 4.10, 4.11 and 11.5; provided, that such Lender continues to comply with the
requirements of Section 4.10(g).  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement
that does not comply with this Section 11.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation
in such rights and obligations in accordance with and subject to the requirements of paragraph (e) of this Section.
 
(b)          Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 11.6 to the contrary, but subject to recording thereof in the applicable Related-Party Register pursuant
to paragraph (d) below, a Lender may assign any or all of its rights hereunder to an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund
of such Lender without (a) providing any notice (including, without limitation, any administrative questionnaire) to the Administrative
Agent or any other Person or (b) delivering an executed Assignment and Assumption to the Administrative Agent; provided
that (A) such assigning Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement, (B) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such assigning Lender in connection with such assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this
Agreement until an Assignment and Assumption and an administrative questionnaire have been delivered to the Administrative Agent,
(C) the failure of such assigning Lender to deliver an Assignment and Assumption or administrative questionnaire to the Administrative
Agent or any other Person shall not affect the legality, validity or binding effect of such assignment and (D) an Assignment and
Assumption between an assigning Lender and its Affiliate or Approved Fund shall be effective as of the date specified in such Assignment
and Assumption.
 
(c)          The
Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes),
shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent
thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of,
and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof
from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest
error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available
for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  In
the case of an assignment to an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund pursuant to paragraph (c), as to which an Assignment
and Assumption and an administrative questionnaire are not delivered to the Administrative Agent, the assigning Lender shall, acting
solely for this purpose as a non-
 

143
 

 
fiduciary agent of the
Borrower, maintain a register (a “Related Party Register”) comparable
to the Register on behalf of the Borrower.  The Register or Related Party Register shall be available for inspection
by the Borrower, the Issuing Lenders, the Swingline Lender and any Lender at the Administrative Agent’s office at any reasonable
time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) above, upon its
receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignee’s completed
administrative questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred
to in paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register.  No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless and until it has been recorded in the Register (or, in the
case of an assignment pursuant to paragraph (c) above, the applicable Related Party Register) as provided in this paragraph (d)
or, in the case of an assignment pursuant to paragraph (i) below, the applicable Conduit Lender Register as provided in paragraph
(i) below.  The date of such recordation of a transfer shall be referred to herein as the “Assignment
Effective Date.”
 
(d)          (i)  Any
Lender may, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more
banks or other entities (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such
Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to
it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (C) the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Lenders, the Swingline Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, (D) no participation shall be permitted to
be made to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor any officer or director of any such Person and (E) no sale of a participation
shall be effective until and unless recorded in the selling Lender’s Participant Register.  Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement
or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification
or waiver that requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of
Section 11.1.  Subject to paragraph (g) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled
to the benefits of Sections 4.9, 4.10 and 4.11 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to
the benefits of Section 11.7(b) as though it were a Lender; provided such Participant shall be subject to Section 11.7(a)
as though it were a Lender.
 
(e)          Each
Lender that sells participations to a Participant, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall
maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amount of and interest owing
with respect to the participation sold to each such Participant (the “Participant Register”); provided that
no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any participant
or any information relating to a participant's interest in
 

144
 

 
any commitments, loans,
letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is
necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c)
or Section 1.871-14(c)(1) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive
(absent manifest error), and the Borrower and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in such Participant Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a participant for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  For
the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as such) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant
Register.
 
(f)          A
Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 4.9 or 4.10 than the applicable Lender would have
been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant had no such participation been transferred
to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent.  Any
Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 4.10 unless such Participant complies with Section 4.10(g) and (i)
as if it were a Lender.  
 
(g)          Any
Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other Person,
and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest or to any such sale or securitization;
provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(h)          Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender without
the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 11.6(b), provided
that any such Conduit Lender shall maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of its designating Lender and the
principal amount of and interest owing with respect to the Loans so assigned to its designating Lender (the “Conduit Lender
Register”) and that such assignment shall not be effective until and unless recorded in the applicable Conduit Lender
Register.  The Borrower, each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against
a Conduit Lender or join any other Person in instituting against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day after the payment in full
of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender; provided, however, that each Lender designating
any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense
arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance.
 
(i)          Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Term Lender may, at any time, assign all or a portion of its Term Loans on a non-pro
rata basis to the Borrower in accordance with the procedures set forth on Exhibit J, pursuant to an offer made available to all
Term Lenders on a pro rata basis (a “Dutch Auction”), subject to the following limitations:
 

145
 

 
(i)          The
Borrower shall represent and warrant, as of the date of the launch of the Dutch Auction and on the date of any such assignment,
that neither it, its Affiliates nor any of its respective directors or officers has any Excluded Information that has not been
disclosed to the Term Lenders generally (other than to the extent any such Term Lender does not wish to receive material non-public
information with respect to the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective securities) prior to such date;
 
(ii)         immediately
and automatically, without any further action on the part of the Borrower, any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any other Person,
upon the effectiveness of such assignment of Term Loans from a Term Lender to the Borrower, such Term Loans and all rights and
obligations as a Term Lender related thereto shall, for all purposes under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and otherwise,
be deemed to be irrevocably prepaid, terminated, extinguished, cancelled and of no further force and effect and the Borrower shall
neither obtain nor have any rights as a Term Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents by virtue of such assignment;
 
(iii)        the
Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Revolving Loans for any such assignment; and
 
(iv)        no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing before or immediately after giving effect to such assignment.
 
(j)          With
respect to any proposed assignment or participation for a Disqualified Institution:
 
(i)          No
assignment or participation shall be made to any Person that was a Disqualified Institution as of the date (the “Trade
Date”) on which the assigning Lender entered into a binding agreement to sell and assign all or a portion of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement to such Person (unless the Borrower has consented to such assignment in writing in its sole
and absolute discretion, in which case such Person will not be considered a Disqualified Institution for the purpose of such assignment
or participation).  For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any assignee that becomes a Disqualified Institution
after the applicable Trade Date (including as a result of the delivery of a notice pursuant to the definition of “Disqualified
Institution”), such assignee shall not retroactively be disqualified from becoming a Lender. Any assignment in violation
of this clause (k)(i) shall not be void, but the other provisions of this clause (k) shall apply.
 
(ii)         If
any assignment or participation is made to any Disqualified Institution without the Borrower’s prior written consent in violation
of clause (i) above, or if any Person becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable Trade Date, the Borrower may, at
its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Institution and the Administrative Agent, (A) terminate
any Revolving Credit Commitment of such Disqualified Institution and repay all
 

146
 

 
obligations of
the Borrower owing to such Disqualified Institution in connection with such Revolving Credit Commitment, (B) in the case of outstanding
Term Loans held by Disqualified Institutions, purchase or prepay such Term Loan by paying the lesser of (x) the principal amount
thereof and (y) the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire such Term Loans, in each case plus accrued interest,
accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder and/or (C) require such Disqualified
Institution to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 11.6), all
of its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees at the lesser of (x) the principal
amount thereof and (y) the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire such interests, rights and obligations, in
each case plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder.
 
(iii)        Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Disqualified Institutions (A) will not (x) have the right to receive information,
reports or other materials provided to Lenders by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, (y) attend or participate
in meetings attended by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, or (z) access any electronic site established for the Lenders
or confidential communications from counsel to or financial advisors of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders and (B) for purposes
of any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of, or any action under, and for the purpose of any direction to the Administrative
Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) under this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
each Disqualified Institution will be deemed to have consented in the same proportion as the Lenders that are not Disqualified
Institutions consented to such matter.
 
(iv)        The
Administrative Agent shall have the right, and the Borrower hereby expressly authorizes the Administrative Agent, to (A) post the
list of Disqualified Institutions provided by the Borrower and any updates thereto from time to time (collectively, the “DQ
List”) on the Platform, including that portion  of the Platform that is designated for “public side”
Lenders and/or (B) provide the DQ List to each Lender requesting the same.
 
11.7        Sharing
of Payments; Set-off.  (a)  Except to the extent that this Agreement expressly provides for payments to
be allocated to a particular Lender or to the Lenders under a particular Facility, if any Lender (a “Benefitted
Lender”) shall, at any time after the Loans and other amounts payable hereunder shall immediately become due
and payable pursuant to Section 9, receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it, or receive any collateral
in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred
to in Section 9.1(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender,
if any, in respect of the 

the excess payment or benefits of 
 

147
 

 
such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender,
such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.  Each
Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring
a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with
respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a director creditor of each Loan Party in the amount of such participation
to the extent provided in clause (b) of this Section 11.7.
 
(b)  In addition
to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, subject to Section 10.11, each Lender shall have the right, without
