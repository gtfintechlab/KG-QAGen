determining compliance with any covenant (including the computation of any financial covenant) contained herein, Debt of Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be carried at 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, and the effects
of FASB ASC 825 on financial liabilities shall be disregarded.  (b) Changes in GAAP. If at any time any change in GAAP would
affect the computation of any financial ratio or requirement set forth in any Loan Document, and either the Borrowers or the Required Lenders shall so request, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrowers shall negotiate in good faith to
amend such ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP (subject to the approval of the Required Lenders); provided that, until so amended, (i) such ratio or requirement shall
continue to be computed in accordance with GAAP prior to such change therein and (ii) the Borrowers shall provide to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders financial statements and other documents required under this Agreement or as

2.01 The Loans.  
(a) The Term A-1 Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Term A-1 Lender severally agrees to make a single

respective Term A-1 Commitments. Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01(a) and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. Term A-1 Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein. In no event shall the
US Borrower be obligated or otherwise liable for any Term A-1 Loans except in its capacity as a Guarantor.  (b) The Term A-2 Loans.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Term A-2 Lender severally agrees to make a single loan to the US Borrower in Dollars on the Closing Date in an amount not to exceed such Lenders Term A-2 Commitment. The Term A-2
Borrowing shall consist of Term A-2 Loans made simultaneously by the Term A-2 Lenders in accordance with their respective Term A-2 Commitments. Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01(b) and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. Term

  33 


(c) The Revolving Credit Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each
Revolving Credit Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a Revolving Credit Loan) to the applicable Borrower requesting a Revolving Credit Loan in accordance herewith from time to time, on any Business Day during
the Availability Period, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such Revolving Credit Lenders Commitment; provided that after giving effect to any Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing, (i) the Total
Revolving Credit Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of any Lender, plus such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the
Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment. Within the limits of each
Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, each Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this
Section 2.01(c). Revolving Credit Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein.  (d)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 2.01(a), (b) and (c), the initial Credit Extensions on the Closing Date shall be Base Rate Loans except to the extent that the applicable Borrower, at least three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, shall have entered into an indemnity agreement covering the matters in Section 3.05, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and provided a Loan Notice to the
Administrative Agent.  (e) Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, in no event will the Cayman
Borrower be obligated or otherwise liable for any Term A-2 Loans, Revolving Credit Loans or other Obligations of any nature of the US Borrower or any other Loan Partys guaranty of any such Obligations of the US Borrower or under any other Loan
Document.  2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans. 
(a) Each Borrowing, each conversion of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar
Rate Loans shall be made upon the applicable Borrowers irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (i) three
Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate
Loans. Each telephonic notice by the applicable Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible
Officer of such Borrower. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c) and
2.04(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether such
Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case
may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) to the extent applicable, the principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Term Loans or
Revolving Credit Loans are to be converted or continued and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If a Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if a Borrower fails to give a timely
notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in
effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If a Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have
specified an Interest Period of one month. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Swing Line Loan may not be converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan. 
  34 


(b) Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender in writing under the applicable Facility and Class of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the applicable
Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Term Loan Borrowing or a Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing, each
applicable Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds in the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders not later
than 3:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice. Each Lender may, at its option, make any Loan available to the Cayman Borrower by causing any foreign or domestic branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan;
provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Cayman Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in
Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the applicable Borrower in like funds as received by the
Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of such Borrower on the books of JPMCB with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably
acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by such Borrower; provided that if, on the date the Loan Notice with respect to such Borrowing is given by such Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing,
first, shall be applied to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be made available to such Borrower as provided above. 
(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for
such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of an Event of Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans if the Administrative Agent has, or the Required Lenders in respect of such Facility have,
determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such request, conversion or continuation.  (d) The Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of the applicable Class of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of each applicable Class of any change in the Prime Rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change. 
  35 


(e) After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans from one Type to the other,
and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than (i) ten Interest Periods in effect with respect to Revolving Credit Loans, (ii) ten Interest Periods in effect with respect to Term A-1 Loans, (iii) ten
Interest Periods in effect with respect to Term A-2 Loans or (iv) ten Interest Periods with respect to Incremental Term Loans of any Series. 
2.03 Letters of Credit. 
(a) The Letter of Credit Commitment. 
(i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of
the Revolving Credit Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account of
any Borrower (or, so long as a Borrower is a joint and several co-applicant with respect thereto, the account of such Borrowers Subsidiaries), and to amend or extend Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with subsection
(b) below, and (2) to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit; and (B) the Revolving Credit Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for the account of any Borrower or its Subsidiaries and any drawings
thereunder; provided that after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, (x) the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments, (y) the
aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of any Revolving Credit Lender, plus such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Lenders Applicable Percentage of
the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment and (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Each request by a Borrower for
the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by such Borrower that the L/C Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Within the foregoing
limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Borrowers ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly any Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of
Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. In no event shall the US Borrower be obligated or otherwise liable for any Letter of Credit issued for the account of the Cayman Borrower or any of the Cayman Borrowers
Subsidiaries except in its capacity as a Guarantor. In no event shall the Cayman Borrower be obligated or otherwise liable for any Letter Credit issued for the account of the US Borrower or any of the US Borrowers Subsidiaries. 
  36 


(ii) The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit, if: 
(A) subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the expiry date of the requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve
months after the date of issuance or last extension, unless the Required Revolving Credit Lenders have approved such expiry date; or 
(B) the expiry date of the requested Letter of Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless all the
Revolving Credit Lenders have approved such expiry date.  (iii) The L/C Issuer shall not be under any obligation to issue
any Letter of Credit if:  (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms
purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing the Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the
L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or the Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to the Letter of Credit any restriction,
reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing
Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;  (B) the issuance of the Letter of Credit would violate
one or more policies of the L/C Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally;  (C) except as otherwise agreed by the
Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, the Letter of Credit is in an initial stated amount less than $100,000;  (D) the
Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars;  (E) any Lender is at that time a Defaulting
Lender, unless the L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with the Borrowers or such Defaulting Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuers actual or
potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as
to which the L/C Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion; or  (F) the
Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder. 
  37 


(iv) The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit if the L/C Issuer would
not be permitted at such time to issue the Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof.  (v) The L/C Issuer
shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue the Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof or (B) the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit
does not accept the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit.  (vi) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Revolving
Credit Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX with
respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term Administrative
Agent as used in Article IX included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer. 
(b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit. 
(i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of a Borrower delivered to the L/C
Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of such Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and
the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date
or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed
issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day) and the Borrower for whose account the Letter of Credit will be issued; (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of
the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the
purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit; and (H) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall
specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (w) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (x) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (y) the nature of the proposed amendment; and
(z) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. Additionally, the Borrower requesting such Letter of Credit or amendment shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information
pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may reasonably require. 
  38 


(ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer
will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from such Borrower and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with
a copy thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Revolving Credit Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter
of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of
such Borrower (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuers usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of
Credit, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit
Lenders Applicable Percentage multiplied by the amount of such Letter of Credit.  (iii) If any Borrower so
requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit);
provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice
to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Non-Extension Notice Date) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, such
Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Credit Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the
L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the
L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or
(iii) of Section 2.03(a) or otherwise) or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the
Administrative Agent that the Required Revolving Credit Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Credit Lender or the applicable Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions
specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension. 
(iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with
respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
  39 


(c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations. 
(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C
Issuer shall notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing thereof. Not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit, if such Borrower has been so notified at or before 1:00 p.m.
on such date, otherwise not later than 2:00 p.m. on the next Business Day (such applicable date, an Honor Date), the applicable Borrower that requested such Letter of Credit shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the
Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If such Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender in writing of the Honor Date, the
amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed Amount), and the amount of such Lenders Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, the applicable Borrower that requested such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to have
requested a Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal
amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Loan Notice). 
(ii) Each Revolving Credit Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available (and
the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the L/C Issuer (in the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders) in an amount equal
to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 3:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Revolving
Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the applicable Borrower that requested such Letter of Credit in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer.
 (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing of Base
Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the applicable Borrower that requested such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing
in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Revolving Credit Lenders
payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in
satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03. 
  40 


(iv) Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or L/C
Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the
L/C Issuer.  (v) Each Revolving Credit Lenders obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse
the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or (C) any other occurrence, event or
condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that each Revolving Credit Lenders obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02 (other than delivery by a Borrower of a Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment
made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.  (vi) If any Revolving Credit
Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in
Section 2.03(c)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for
the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the L/C Issuer in accordance
with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid),
the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Revolving Credit Loan included in the relevant Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of the L/C Issuer
submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(d) Repayment of Participations. 
(i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Credit
Lender such Lenders L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or
interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower obligated with respect to such Unreimbursed Amount or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to
such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 
  41 


(ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the
L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each
Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is
returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of
this Agreement.  (e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing
under each Letter of Credit requested by such Borrower and to repay each L/C Borrowing relating thereto shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including the following:  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document;  (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that
such Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether
in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
(iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 
(iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; 
(v) any force majeure or other event that under any rule of law or uniform practices to which any Letter of
Credit is subject (including Section 3.14 of ISP 98 or any successor publication of the International Chamber of Commerce) permits a drawing to be made under such Letter of Credit after the stated expiration date thereof or of the Revolving
Credit Commitments; or 
  42 


(vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to
any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, either Borrower or any Subsidiary. 
The applicable Borrower requesting any Letter of Credit shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit requested by such Borrower and
each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with such Borrowers instructions or other irregularity, such Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The applicable Borrower requesting
such Letter of Credit shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
(f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and each Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall
not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of
the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for
(i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Revolving Credit Lenders or the Required Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct (with such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment); or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of
any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. Each Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided that
this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrowers pursuing such rights and remedies as they may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent,
any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 2.03(e);
provided that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, a Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to such Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to
consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by such Borrower which such Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuers willful misconduct or gross negligence (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable
judgment) or the L/C Issuers willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C
Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring, endorsing or assigning or purporting to transfer, endorse or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole
or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. 
  43 


(g) Applicability of ISP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the
applicable Borrower requesting a Letter of Credit when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the ISP shall apply to each Letter of Credit. 
(h) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower requesting a Letter of Credit shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the Letter of Credit Fee) for each Letter of Credit requested by such Borrower equal to the product of the Applicable Rate multiplied by
the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit; provided that any Letter of Credit Fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has
not provided Cash Collateral reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in
their respective Applicable Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.16(a)(iv), with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the L/C Issuer for its own account. For purposes of computing the daily amount
available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of
each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis in
arrears. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that
such Applicable Rate was in effect.  (i) Fronting Fee and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer. The applicable Borrower shall
pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit requested by such Borrower, at the rate per annum specified in the Administrative Agent Fee Letter, computed on the daily amount available to be
drawn under such Letter of Credit on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fee shall be due and payable on the tenth Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December in respect of the most recently-ended quarterly period
(or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the daily
amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. In addition, the applicable Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own
account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect with respect to the Letter of Credit requested by
such Borrower. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable promptly on demand and are nonrefundable.  (j)
Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control. 
  44 


(k) Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit
issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the applicable Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit. Each
Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit at such Borrowers request for the account of its Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of such Borrower, and that such Borrowers business derives substantial benefits from
the businesses of such Subsidiaries.  2.04 Swing Line Loans. 
(a) The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender, in reliance upon the agreements of the
other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.04, may in its sole discretion make loans (each such loan, a Swing Line Loan) to any Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period in an
aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and
L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment; provided that after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings
shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments, (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of any Revolving Credit Lender, plus such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of
all L/C Obligations, plus such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment, and (iii) the Swing Line Lender shall not be under any
obligation to make any Swing Line Loan if it shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that is has, or by such Credit Extension may have, Fronting Exposure; provided, further, that no
Borrower shall use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, each Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.04,
prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.04. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lenders Applicable Percentage multiplied by the amount of such Swing
Line Loan. In no event will the US Borrower be obligated or otherwise liable for any Swing Line Loan of the Cayman Borrower except in its capacity as a Guarantor. In no event will the Cayman Borrower be obligated or otherwise liable for any Swing
Line Loans of the US Borrower. 
  45 


(b) Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon a Borrowers
irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing
date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic
notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of such Borrower. Promptly after receipt by the
Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the
Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any
Revolving Credit Lender) prior to 3:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first
sentence of Section 2.04(a) or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 4:00
p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the applicable Borrower at its office by crediting the account of such Borrower on the books of the Swing Line Lender in
immediately available funds.  (c) Refinancing of Swing Line Loans. 
(i) The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole discretion may request, on behalf of the applicable Borrower (which hereby
irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Credit Lender make a Base Rate Loan that is a Revolving Credit Loan in an amount equal to such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the amount of Swing
Line Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and
multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swing Line Lender shall
furnish the applicable Borrower with a copy of the applicable Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Credit Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the amount specified
in such Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swing Line Loan) for the account of the Swing Line Lender (in
the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders) not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each
Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the applicable Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender. 
(ii) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing in accordance with
Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Revolving Credit Lenders fund its risk participation in
the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Revolving Credit Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.

  46 


(iii) If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swing
Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately
available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Swing Line Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative,
processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Revolving Credit
Loan included in the relevant Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative
Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (iv) Each
Revolving Credit Lenders obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by
any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or
continuance of a Default or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that each Revolving Credit Lenders obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this
Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans borrowed by
such Borrower, together with interest as provided herein.  (d) Repayment of Participations. 
(i) At any time after any Revolving Credit Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the
Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender. 
(ii) If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to
be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the
Swing Line Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The
Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender. The obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
  47 


(e) Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible
for invoicing the applicable Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lenders Applicable
Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender. 
(f) Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. Each Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line
Loans borrowed by such Borrower directly to the Swing Line Lender.  2.05 Prepayments. 
(a) The Borrowers may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Term Loans of any Class and
Revolving Credit Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (A) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of
Eurodollar Rate Loans and (B) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any
prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and
amount of such prepayment and the Class and Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each applicable Lender of its receipt of
each such notice, and of the amount of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such prepayment (in respect of the relevant Facility). If such notice is given by a Borrower, such Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount
specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to
Section 3.05. Each prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05(a) shall be applied to the principal repayment installments thereof as directed by the applicable Borrower and, if not otherwise directed by the
applicable Borrower, in forward order of maturity. Subject to Section 2.16, each such prepayment shall be paid to the applicable Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages of the relevant Facility. 
(b) Each Borrower may, upon notice to the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time,
voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans of such Borrower in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the
date of the prepayment and (ii) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000 or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such
prepayment. If such notice is given by a Borrower, such Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. 
  48 


(c) If for any reason the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate
Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect, each Borrower shall promptly prepay its Revolving Credit Loans and/or Swing Line Loans, and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations, in an aggregate collective amount taking in to account all such
payments, equal to such excess; provided that no Borrower shall be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) unless after the prepayment in full of the Revolving Credit Loans and the Swing
Line Loans, the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect.  2.06 Termination
or Reduction of Commitments.   (a) Optional. The Borrowers may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the
Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments or any Incremental Term Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments or any Incremental Term Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall
be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. three Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Borrowers shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings
would exceed the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments, and (iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the amount of the
Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments, such Sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Revolving Credit Lenders or the applicable Incremental Term Lenders of any such
notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments. Any reduction of (x) the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments shall be applied to the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Revolving Credit Lender or
(y) the Incremental Term Commitments of any Class shall be applied to the Incremental Term Commitment of each Incremental Term Lender providing such Incremental Term Commitment, in each case according to its Applicable Percentage. All fees
accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments or the Incremental Term Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. 
(b) Mandatory. The aggregate Term A-1 Commitments shall be automatically and permanently reduced to zero on the date of the Term A-1
Loan Borrowing. The aggregate Term A-2 Commitments shall be automatically and permanently reduced to zero on the date of the Term A-2 Loan Borrowing.

2.07 Repayment of Loans.

Maturity Date of the Revolving Credit Facility the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans borrowed by such Borrower and outstanding on such date.

 2.08 Interest. 
(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the
applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate
per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate or such other rate per annum as shall be agreed to from time to time by the Swing Line Lender and the applicable Borrower. 
  50 


(b) (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (without regard to any
applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Laws.  (ii) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by the Borrowers under any Loan Document is
not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate
per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.  (iii) Accrued and
unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.  (c) Interest on each
Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment,
and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.  2.09 Fees. In addition to certain fees
described in subsections (h) and (i) of Section 2.03:  (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrowers shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a commitment fee equal to the product of the Applicable Rate multiplied by the actual daily amount by which the Aggregate
Revolving Credit Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans plus (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.16. The commitment
fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on each Fiscal Quarter End Date,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period. The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter,
the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. 
(b) Other Fees. The Borrowers shall pay to (i) the Bookrunners for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the
times specified in the Bookrunner Fee Letter, (ii) the Administrative Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Administrative Agent Fee Letter and (iii) the Lenders such fees as shall have been
separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 
  51 


2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Rate.
(a) All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Prime Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest
shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the
Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to
Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
(b) If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of Holdings or for any other reason, the Borrowers,
Holdings or the Lenders determine that (i) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as calculated by Holdings as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher
pricing for such period, each Borrower shall be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of
an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to such Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer), an amount equal to
the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid by such Borrower for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid by such Borrower for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the
Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under Section 2.03(c)(iii), 2.03(i) or 2.08(b) or under Article VIII. Each Borrowers obligations under this paragraph shall survive the
termination of the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.  2.11 Evidence of Debt.
 (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by
the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the
Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In
the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the
absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, a Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lenders Loans to such
Borrower in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans to such Borrower and payments with respect thereto. 
  52 


(b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a), each Lender shall
maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans of each Borrower; provided, however, that any failure to
so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. 
2.12 Payments Generally; Administrative Agents Clawback. 
(a) General. All payments to be made by any Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense,
recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by any Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, to such account as may be
specified by the Administrative Agent in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 3:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage of the relevant
Facility (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lenders Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 3:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on
the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and
such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.  (b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by
Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing of
Base Rate Loans, prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of such Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing, the Administrative Agent
may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance
with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Revolving Credit Lender has not in fact made its share of the
applicable Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Revolving Credit Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a
payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees
customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such
interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the
applicable Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Revolving Credit Loan included in such Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing. Any payment by a Borrower shall be without
prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
  53 


(ii) Payments by Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the applicable Borrower will
not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the
amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to
such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the
Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the applicable Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection
(b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to
the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the applicable Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the
conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such
Lender, without interest.  (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans and
Revolving Credit Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 11.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such
participation or to make any payment under Section 11.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of
any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 11.04(c). 
  54 


(e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the
funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
2.13 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain
payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans of any Class made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the
aggregate amount of such Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent
of such fact and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the applicable Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the
benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that: 
(i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
(ii) the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on
behalf of the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including (A) the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender and (B) any prepayments made pursuant to
Section 3.01, 3.04 or 3.05), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.15 or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to any Borrower or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this
Section 2.13 shall apply).  Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation. 
  55 


2.14 Increase in Commitments; Incremental Loans. 
(a) Each or both of the Borrowers may on one or more occasions, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, request (i) the
establishment, prior to the Maturity Date applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility, of Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments and/or (ii) the establishment of Incremental Term Commitments, provided that the aggregate amount of all
the Incremental Commitments established hereunder shall not exceed $1,000,000,000 during the term of this Agreement. Each such notice shall specify (A) the date on which the applicable Borrower proposes that the Incremental Revolving Credit
Commitments or the Incremental Term Commitments, as applicable, shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than 10 Business Days (or such shorter period as may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent) after the date on which such notice is
delivered to the Administrative Agent, and (B) the amount of the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments or Incremental Term Commitments, as applicable, being requested (it being agreed that (x) any Lender approached to provide any
Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment or Incremental Term Commitment may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment or Incremental Term Commitment and (y) any Person that the applicable
Borrower(s) proposes to become an Incremental Lender, if such Person is not then a Lender, must be an Eligible Assignee and must be approved by the Administrative Agent and, in the case of any proposed Incremental Revolving Credit Lender, the L/C
Issuer and the Swing Line Lender (such approvals not to be unreasonably withheld)).  (b) The terms and conditions of any Incremental
Revolving Credit Commitment and Revolving Credit Loans and other extensions of credit to be made thereunder shall be identical to those of the Revolving Credit Commitments and Revolving Credit Loans and other extensions of credit made thereunder,
and shall be treated as a single Class with such Revolving Credit Commitments and Revolving Credit Loans. The terms and conditions of any Incremental Term Commitments and the Incremental Term Loans to be made thereunder shall be, except as otherwise
set forth herein or in the applicable Incremental Facility Agreement, identical to those of the Term A-1 Commitments and the Term A-1 Loans if made to the Cayman Borrower, or the Term A-2 Commitments and the Term A-2 Loans if made to the US
Borrower; provided that (i) the weighted average life to maturity of any Incremental Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining weighted average life to maturity of the Term A-1 Loans or the Term A-2 Loans and (ii) no
Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date shall be earlier than the latest of (A) the Maturity Date applicable to the Term A-1 Loans, (B) the Maturity Date applicable to the Term A-2 Loans and (C) the Maturity Date applicable to any other
outstanding Incremental Term Loans made pursuant to this Agreement at such time. Any Incremental Term Commitments established pursuant to an Incremental Facility Agreement that do not have terms and conditions identical to the Term A-1 Commitments
or the Term A-2 Commitments, and any Incremental Term Loans made thereunder, shall in any event comply with the proviso in the preceding sentence and shall be designated as a separate series (each a Series) of Incremental Term
Commitments and Incremental Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement. 
  56 


(c) The Incremental Commitments shall be effected pursuant to one or more Incremental Facility
Agreements executed and delivered by Holdings, the applicable Borrower(s), each Incremental Lender providing such Incremental Commitments and the Administrative Agent (with agreement to such Incremental Facility Agreements by the Administrative
Agent not to be unreasonably withheld); provided that no Incremental Commitments shall become effective unless (i) on the date of effectiveness thereof or, if the proceeds of Loans from Incremental Commitments will be used in connection
with an acquisition, on the date such Incremental Commitments are funded as Loans, both immediately prior to and immediately after giving effect to such Incremental Commitments (and assuming that the full amount of such Incremental Commitments to be
funded on such date shall have been funded as Loans on such date), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (ii) the representations and warranties of the Borrowers and each other Loan Party contained in Article V or any other
Loan Document shall be true and correct in all material respects (or, with respect to representations and warranties modified by materiality standards, in all respects) on the date of effectiveness thereof and after giving effect to the making of
Loans and issuance of Letters of Credit thereunder to be made on such date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects
(or, with respect to representations and warranties modified by materiality standards, in all respects) as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.14, the representations and warranties contained in
subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to clauses (b) and (a), respectively, of Section 6.09, (iii) the Borrowers shall make any
payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.05 or otherwise in connection with such Incremental Commitments and the related transactions under this Section 2.14 (including payment of fees and expenses owing in respect
of such Incremental Commitments to the Administrative Agent and Incremental Lenders providing such Incremental Commitments) and (iv) Holdings and the Borrowers shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent such legal opinions, board
resolutions, secretarys certificates, officers certificates and other documents as shall reasonably be requested by the Administrative Agent in connection with any such transaction. Each Incremental Facility Agreement may, without the
consent of any Lender, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to give effect to the provisions of this Section 2.14 (including
amendments to the definition of Fiscal Quarter End Date to include additional dates as may be necessary).  (d) Upon the
effectiveness of an Incremental Commitment of any Incremental Lender, (i) such Incremental Lender shall be deemed to be a Lender (and a Lender in respect of Commitments and Loans of the applicable Class) hereunder, and henceforth
shall be entitled to all the rights of, and benefits accruing to, Lenders (or Lenders in respect of Commitments and Loans of the applicable Class) hereunder and shall be bound by all agreements, acknowledgements and other obligations of Lenders (or
Lenders in respect of Commitments and Loans of the applicable Class) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and (ii) in the case of any Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment, (A) such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment shall
constitute (or, in the event such Incremental Lender already has a Revolving Credit Commitment, shall increase) the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Incremental Lender and (B) the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments shall be increased by
the amount of such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment, in each case, subject to further increase or reduction from time to time as set forth in the definition of the term Revolving Credit Commitment. For the avoidance of doubt, upon
the effectiveness of any Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment, the Outstanding Amount with respect to Revolving Credit Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C Obligations of the Incremental Revolving Credit Lender holding such Commitment, and the
Applicable Percentage of all the Revolving Credit Lenders, shall automatically be adjusted to give effect thereto. 
  57 


(e) On the date of effectiveness of any Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, (i) the
aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans outstanding (the Existing Revolving Credit Loan Borrowings) immediately prior to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments shall be deemed to be
repaid, (ii) each Incremental Revolving Credit Lender that shall have had a Revolving Credit Commitment prior to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments shall pay to the Administrative Agent in same day funds an
amount equal to the difference between (A) the product of (1) such Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments) multiplied by (2) the
aggregate amount of the Resulting Revolving Credit Loan Borrowings (as hereinafter defined) and (B) the product of (1) such Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental
Revolving Credit Commitments) multiplied by (2) the aggregate amount of the Existing Revolving Credit Loan Borrowings, (iii) each Incremental Revolving Credit Lender that shall not have had a Revolving Credit Commitment prior to the
effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments shall pay to Administrative Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the product of (1) such Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the
effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments) multiplied by (2) the aggregate amount of the Resulting Revolving Credit Loan Borrowings, (iv) after the Administrative Agent receives the funds specified in clauses (ii)
and (iii) above, the Administrative Agent shall pay to each Revolving Credit Lender the portion of such funds that is equal to the difference between (A) the product of (1) such Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated without
giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments) multiplied by (2) the aggregate amount of the Existing Revolving Borrowings, and (B) the product of (1) such Lenders Applicable Percentage
(calculated after giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments) multiplied by (2) the aggregate amount of the Resulting Revolving Credit Loan Borrowings, (v) after the effectiveness of such
Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, the Borrower shall be deemed to have made new Revolving Credit Loan Borrowings (the Resulting Revolving Credit Loan Borrowings) in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate amount of the
Existing Revolving Credit Loan Borrowings and of the Types and for the Interest Periods specified in a Loan Notice delivered to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.02 (and the applicable Borrower shall deliver such Loan
Notice), (vi) each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to hold its Applicable Percentage of each Resulting Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing (calculated after giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Credit
Commitments) and (vii) the applicable Borrower shall pay each Revolving Credit Lender any and all accrued but unpaid interest on its Loans comprising the Existing Revolving Borrowings. The deemed payments of the Existing Revolving Credit Loan
Borrowings made pursuant to clause (i) above shall be subject to compensation by the Borrowers pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.05 if the date of the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments occurs other than
on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto.  (f) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the applicable
Incremental Facility Agreement, each Lender holding an Incremental Term Commitment shall make a loan to the applicable Borrower in an amount equal to such Incremental Term Commitment on the date specified in such Incremental Facility Agreement. 
(g) The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders promptly upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of any notice from any Borrower
referred to in Section 2.14(a) and of the effectiveness of any Incremental Commitments, in each case advising the Lenders of the details thereof and, in the case of effectiveness of any Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, of the
Applicable Percentages of the Revolving Credit Lenders after giving effect thereto and of the assignments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14(e). 
  58 


(h) Conflicting Provisions. This Section 2.14 shall supersede any provisions
in Section 2.13 or 11.01 to the contrary.  2.15 Cash Collateral. 
(a) Certain Credit Support Events. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer (i) if the L/C Issuer has honored
any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrower for
whose account such Letter of Credit is issued shall, in each case, promptly Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all such L/C Obligations or, in the case of any such L/C Borrowing, repay such L/C Borrowing. At any time that there shall
exist a Defaulting Lender, promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, the applicable Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all
Fronting Exposure allocated to such Borrower (after giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). 
(b) Grant of Security Interest. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be
maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at the Administrative Agent. Each Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders (including the Swing Line Lender), and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so
provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations of the applicable Borrower to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.15(c). If at any time the
Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral allocable to such Borrower is less than the
applicable Fronting Exposure allocable to such Borrower and other obligations secured thereby, such Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent
additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.  (c) Application. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 2.15 or Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.16 or 8.02 by any Borrower in respect of Letters of Credit or Swing Line
Loans of such Borrower shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, Swing Line Loans, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest
accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein. 
  59 


(d) Release. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce
Fronting Exposure or to secure other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of
the applicable Revolving Credit Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 11.06(b)(vi))) or (ii) the Administrative Agents good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral;
provided that (x) Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Loan Party shall not be released during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default (and following application as provided in this Section 2.15 may be
otherwise applied in accordance with Section 8.03) and (y) the Person (including the applicable Borrower) providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as applicable, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be
released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.  2.16 Defaulting Lenders. 
(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then,
until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:  (i) Waivers
and Amendments. That Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 11.01. 
(ii) Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative
Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 11.08), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;
second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by the L/C Issuer or Swing
Line Lender, to be held as Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Swing Line Loan or Letter of Credit; fourth, as the Borrowers may request (so long as no Default or Event of
Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the
Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing
to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting
Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to a Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
obtained by such Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent
jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or L/C
Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Borrowings owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis
prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a
Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.16(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
  60 


(iii) Certain Fees. That Defaulting Lender (x) shall not be entitled
to receive any commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.09(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been
paid to that Defaulting Lender) and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive Letter of Credit Fees as provided in Section 2.03(h). 
(iv) Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. During any period in which there is a
Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans pursuant to Sections 2.03 and 2.04, the
Applicable Percentage of each non-Defaulting Lender shall be computed without giving effect to the Revolving Credit Commitment of that Defaulting Lender; provided that (i) each such reallocation shall be given effect only if,
at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender (or any subsequent date on which the applicable Lender is a Defaulting Lender), no Default or Event of Default exists; and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender
to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) the Revolving Credit Commitment of that non-Defaulting Lender minus (2) the aggregate
Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of that Lender.  (b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrowers, the Administrative
Agent, Swing Line Lender and the L/C Issuer agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the
effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding
Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the
Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv)), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with
respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change
hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. 
  61 


ARTICLE III. 
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 
3.01 Taxes.  (a)
Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of a Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to the extent permitted by applicable Laws
be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes; provided that if any applicable Law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any payment hereunder or under any Loan Document, then (A) the Loan
Party shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Loan Party to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Loan Party shall timely pay the full
amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by such Loan Party shall be increased as
necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including withholding and deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the Administrative Agent, Lender or L/C
Issuer, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.  (b)
Payment of Other Taxes by Borrowers. Without limiting, and without duplication for payments made pursuant to, the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Loan Parties shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable Laws.  (c) Tax Indemnifications. (i) Without limiting, and without duplication for
payments made pursuant to, the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, each Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 30 days
after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01) withheld or deducted on
payments to, or paid by, the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the nature and amount of any such payment or liability delivered to the Loan Parties by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  62 


(ii) Each Lender and L/C Issuer shall severally indemnify the Administrative
Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for any Taxes (but, with respect to Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that the Loan Parties have not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the
obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender or L/C Issuer that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the nature and amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender or any L/C Issuer by the Administrative
Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii). The agreements in this clause (ii) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of
rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 
(d) Evidence of Payments. Upon request by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by a
Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to such Borrower, as the case may be,
the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to such Borrower or
the Administrative Agent, as the case may be.  (e) Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation. (i) Each Lender shall deliver to the
Borrowers and to the Administrative Agent, when reasonably requested by a Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Laws or by the Taxing authorities of any jurisdiction and
such other reasonably requested information as will permit such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine (A) whether or not payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document are subject to Taxes, (B) if
applicable, the required rate of Tax withholding or deduction, and (C) such Lenders entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of payments to be made to such Lender by such Borrower pursuant
to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lenders status for withholding Tax purposes in the applicable jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence, (A) the completion, execution and submission
of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.01(e)(ii)) shall not be required if in the Lenders good faith judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material
unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender and (B) the completion, execution and submission of the documentation set forth in Section 3.01(e)(ii)(C) shall not be
required if in the Lenders good faith judgment such completion, execution or submission would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
  63 


(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if a Borrower is resident
for tax purposes in the United States,  (A) any Lender that is a United States person within the meaning of
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 and such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable Laws or reasonably
requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and
 (B) each Foreign Lender that is entitled under the Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of
United States withholding tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date
on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the
following is applicable:  (I) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits
of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,  (II) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8ECI,  (III) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY and all required supporting documentation, 
(IV) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the
Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of such Borrower within the meaning of
section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or 
(V) executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction
in United States Federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. 
  64 


(C) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to
U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall
deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable
law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the applicable Borrower and the
Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes
of this clause (C), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  (iii)
Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction. 
(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to
file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the
case may be. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole good faith discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to
which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan
Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may
be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that such Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, agrees to
repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender
or the L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information
relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrowers or any other Person. 
  65 


3.02 Illegality. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any
Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based
upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to
the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the
illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to
avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers that the circumstances giving
rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender
to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the
last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such
notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference
to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate. Upon any such prepayment
or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.  3.03 Inability to Determine Rates.
If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank
eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed
Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrowers and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended and (y) in the
event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the
Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing
that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 
3.04 Increased Costs. 
(a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Rate) or the L/C Issuer; 
  66 


(ii) subject the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any Taxes
(other than Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer) on its Loans, loan principal,
Letters of Credit, participations, Commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 
(iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this
Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be
to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or
maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal,
interest or any other amount) then, from time to time upon written request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer within the time provided by subsection (c) below, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
(b) Capital and Liquidity Requirements. If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the
L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has had or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders
or the L/C Issuers capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of
Credit or Swing Line Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company could have achieved but for
such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or the L/C Issuers policies and the policies of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to
time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company for any such
reduction suffered.  (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or
amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 3.04 and delivered to the Borrowers shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. Each Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as owed by such Borrower on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof; provided that neither any Lender nor the L/C
Issuer shall be entitled to submit a claim for compensation based upon a Change in Law unless it shall have determined that the making of such claim is consistent with its general practices under similar circumstances in respect of similarly
situated borrowers with credit agreements entitling it to make such claims (it being agreed that no Lender or the L/C Issuer shall be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information in connection with such determination or the
making of such claim). 
  67 


(d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to
demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers right to demand such compensation, provided that no Borrower shall be
required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date that such
Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the applicable Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers intention to claim compensation therefor (except
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the one hundred eighty (180) day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
3.05 Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrowers
shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:  (a)
any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
 (b) any failure by the Borrowers (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or
convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrowers (whether or not such notice may be revoked in accordance with the terms hereof); or 
(c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the
Borrowers pursuant to Section 11.13;  including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or
reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrowers shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with
the foregoing.  For purposes of calculating amounts payable by a Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed
to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such
Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded. 
  68 


3.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. 
(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or any Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to
Section 3.02, then at the request of the Borrowers, such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or
3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. Each Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the L/C Issuer in connection
with any such designation or assignment.  (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, the Borrowers may replace such Lender in accordance
with Section 11.13.  3.07 Survival. All of the Borrowers obligations under this Article III shall survive
termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.

Obligations for which it is liable (in an amount equal to the then Outstanding Amount thereof); and  (d) exercise on behalf of itself, the
Lenders and the L/C Issuer all rights and remedies available to it, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under the Loan Documents;  provided that upon

Credit Extensions shall automatically terminate, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans and all interest and other amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable, and the obligation of the Borrowers to Cash
Collateralize the L/C Obligations as aforesaid shall automatically become effective, in each case without further act of the Administrative Agent or any Lender. 
  88 


8.03 Application of Funds. After the exercise of remedies provided for in
Section 8.02 (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately due and payable and the L/C Obligations have automatically been required to be Cash Collateralized as set forth in the proviso to Section 8.02), any
amounts received on account of the Obligations shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 2.15 and 2.16, be applied by the Administrative Agent in the following order: 
First, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including fees,
charges and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent and amounts payable under Article III) payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such; 
Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal, interest
and Letter of Credit Fees) payable to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer (including fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the respective Lenders and the L/C Issuer and amounts payable under Article III), ratably among them in proportion
to the respective amounts described in this clause Second payable to them;  Third, to payment of that portion of the
Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid Letter of Credit Fees and interest on the Loans, L/C Borrowings and other Obligations arising under the Loan Documents, ratably among the Lenders and the L/C Issuer in proportion to the respective amounts
described in this clause Third payable to them;  Fourth, to (a) payment of (i) that portion of the Obligations
constituting unpaid principal of the Loans and L/C Borrowings and (ii) Obligations then owing under Guaranteed Hedge Agreements and Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements, in each case ratably among the Lenders, the L/C Issuer, the Hedge Banks
and the Cash Management Banks and (b) the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer, to Cash Collateralize that portion of L/C Obligations composed of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit to the extent not otherwise
Cash Collateralized by the Borrowers pursuant to Sections 2.03 and 2.15, in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held by each applicable Person; and 
Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been paid in full in cash, to the Borrowers or as otherwise required by
Law.  Subject to Sections 2.03(c) and 2.15, amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to
clause Fourth above shall be applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur. If any amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining
amount shall be applied to the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Obligations arising under
Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements and Guaranteed Hedge Agreements shall be excluded from the application described above if the Administrative Agent has not received written notice thereof, together with such supporting documentation as the
Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be. Each Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank not a party to the Credit Agreement that has given the notice contemplated by the preceding
sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the appointment of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of Article IX hereof for itself and its Affiliates as if a Lender party hereto. 
  89 


Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, no Guaranty by any Guarantor under
any Loan Document shall include a Guaranty of any Obligation that, as to such Guarantor, is an Excluded Swap Obligation. In the event that any payment is made pursuant to any Guaranty by any Guarantor as to which any Obligations are Excluded Swap
Obligations, such payment or amount shall be applied to pay the Obligations of such Loan Party as otherwise provided herein and in the other Loan Documents without giving effect to such Excluded Swap Obligations, and each reference in this Agreement
or any other Loan Document to the ratable application of such amounts as among the Obligations or any specified portion of the Obligations that would otherwise include such Excluded Swap Obligations shall be deemed so to provide. 
ARTICLE IX. 
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 
9.01 Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints the entity named as Administrative
Agent in the heading of this Agreement and its successors to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such
powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, and neither Holdings, either Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. 
9.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity
as a Lender or the L/C Issuer as any other Lender or L/C Issuer and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the
context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in
any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings, the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account
therefor to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer.  9.03 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: 
(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing (and it is
understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)
obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law, and that such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties); 
  90 


(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or to exercise any discretionary
powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of
the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in the Loan Documents); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take
any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; and 
(c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the
failure to disclose, any information relating to Holdings, a Borrower, any other Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in
any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the
request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 11.01 and
8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment). The Administrative Agent
shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice describing such Default (stating that it is a notice of default) is given to the Administrative Agent by Holdings, the Borrowers, a Lender or the L/C
Issuer.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement,
warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith,
(iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness
of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items
expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or satisfaction of any condition that expressly refers to the matters described therein being acceptable or satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for, or be responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered by any Lender as a result of, any determination of the Outstanding Amount or the component amounts thereof except to the extent
that any such loss, cost or expense is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent. 
  91 


9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution)
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents for being the signatory, sender or authenticator
thereof). The Administrative Agent also shall be entitled to rely, and shall not incur any liability for relying, upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in
fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents for being the proper Person), and may act upon any such statement prior to receipt of written confirmation thereof. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a
Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such
Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult
with legal counsel (who may be counsel for Holdings or a Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel,
accountants or experts.  9.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any of and all its duties and exercise its
rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its
rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their
respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents
except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. 
9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent. 
(a) Subject to the terms of this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time from its capacity as such by providing written
notice thereof to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Borrowers. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrowers, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an
office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its intent to resign (such date, the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, in consultation with the Borrowers,
appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become
effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. 
  92 


(b) If the Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the
definition thereof (provided that the determination referred to in such definition shall be undertaken by the Required Lenders rather than the Administrative Agent), the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in
writing to the Borrowers, the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent, remove the Administrative Agent and, in consultation with the Borrowers, appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an
Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States (the date on which such successor accepts such appointment, the Removal Effective Date). 
(c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable), (i) the retiring or removed
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent held on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C
Issuer under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments
owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender or the L/C Issuer directly, until such
time, if any, as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed as provided for above. Upon the acceptance by such successor of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the
Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed by the Borrowers and such successor. After the retiring or removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.04, as well as any exculpatory, reimbursement and indemnification provisions set forth in any other Loan Document, shall continue in effect for
the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as
Administrative Agent and in respect of the matters referred to in the parenthetical under clause (c)(i) above.  (d) Any resignation
by, or removal of, JPMCB as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 9.06 shall also constitute its resignation or removal as L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative
Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender, (ii) the retiring L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender shall be
discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and (iii) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the
time of such succession or make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
  93 


9.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender and the L/C
Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, any Bookrunner or any other Lender or the L/C Issuer or any of the Related Parties of the foregoing, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the
Arranger, any Bookrunner or any other Lender or the L/C Issuer or any of the Related Parties of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking
or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
9.08 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Arranger, the Bookrunners, Co-Syndication
Agents, Co-Documentation Agents or other similar titles listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the
Administrative Agent, a Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder, but all such Persons shall have the benefit of the indemnities provided for hereunder. 
9.09 Consent to Loan Documents. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement and funding its
Loans, or issuing a Letter of Credit, on the Effective Date, or delivering its signature page to an Assignment and Assumption or any other Loan Document pursuant to which it shall become a Lender hereunder, shall be deemed to have acknowledged
receipt of, and consented to and approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be delivered to, or be approved by or satisfactory to, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the L/C Issuer on the Closing Date. 
9.10 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other
judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrowers) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated), by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: 
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and
all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid (other than Obligations in respect of Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements or Guaranteed Hedge Agreements unless consented to by the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be)
and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(i) and (j), 2.08,
2.09, 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 and 11.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 
  94 


(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims
and to distribute the same;  and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and the L/C Issuer to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the L/C
Issuer, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under
Sections 2.08, 2.09, 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 and 11.04.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or the L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or
the L/C Issuer to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or the L/C Issuer in any such proceeding. 
9.11 Guaranty Matters. The Lenders and the L/C Issuer irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its
discretion, to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary or Material Domestic Subsidiary of Holdings as a result of a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents.
Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agents authority to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty pursuant to this
Section 9.11.  9.12 Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements and Guaranteed Hedge Agreements. No Cash Management Bank or Hedge
Bank that obtains the benefits of Section 8.03 or any Guaranty by virtue of the provisions hereof or of any Guaranty shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any
other Loan Document other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IX to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall
not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Obligations arising under Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements and Guaranteed Hedge Agreements unless the Administrative Agent has
received written notice of such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be. 
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Holdings and each Borrower (on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries that are Loan
Parties) and each Lender party hereto (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby acknowledge and agree that (i) the guarantees of the Obligations (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) under the Loan Documents (as defined in the
Existing Credit Agreement) in respect of any Guaranteed Cash Management Agreement and any Guaranteed Hedge Agreement (each as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) are terminated as of the Closing Date and are of no further force or effect and
(ii) each Guaranteed Cash Management Agreement and Guaranteed Hedge Agreement (each as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) shall, without any further act or action of, or notice to, any party, constitute Guaranteed Cash Management
Agreements and Guaranteed Hedge Agreements hereunder, as the case may be.

ARTICLE X. 
CONTINUING GUARANTY 
10.01 Guaranties. 
(a) Guaranty of Holdings. Holdings hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not
merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all of the Obligations of the Loan Parties, whether for
principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise, to the Guaranteed Parties, and whether arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document, any Guaranteed Cash Management Agreement or any Guaranteed Hedge
Agreement (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys fees and expenses incurred by the Guaranteed Parties in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof).
The Administrative Agents books and records showing the amount of the Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon Holdings, and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the
Obligations. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection,
non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of Holdings under this Guaranty, and Holdings hereby irrevocably waives any
defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing.  (b) Guaranty of US Borrower. US
Borrower hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or
otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all of the Obligations of the Loan Parties, whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise, to the Guaranteed Parties, and whether arising
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, any Guaranteed Cash Management Agreement or any Guaranteed Hedge Agreement (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys fees
and expenses incurred by the Guaranteed Parties in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof). The Administrative Agents books and records showing the amount of the Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or
proceeding, and shall be binding upon the US Borrower, and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Obligations. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations or
any instrument or agreement evidencing any Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Obligations which might otherwise
constitute a defense to the obligations of the US Borrower under this Guaranty, and the US Borrower hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing. 
  96 


10.02 Rights of Lenders. Holdings and the US Borrower each consents and agrees that
the Guaranteed Parties may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise
change the time for payment or the terms of the Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Obligations;
(c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders in their sole discretion may determine and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other
guarantors of any of the Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Holdings and the US Borrower each consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the respective risks
of Holdings and the US Borrower under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of Holdings, the US Borrower or both. 
10.03 Certain Waivers. Holdings and the US Borrower each waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or
other defense of any Borrower or any other guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Guaranteed Party) of the liability of any Borrower; (b) any defense based on any claim that Holdings or
the US Borrowers obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of any Borrower; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting Holdings or the US Borrowers liability hereunder; (d) any right to proceed
against any Borrower, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the power of any Guaranteed Party whatsoever; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held
by any Guaranteed Party and (f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties. Holdings and
the US Borrower each expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands
of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Obligations. Each of Holdings and the US Borrower waives any rights and
defenses that are or may become available to it by reason of §§ 2787 to 2855, inclusive, and §§ 2899 and 3433 of the California Civil Code. As provided below, this Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York. The foregoing waivers and the provisions hereinafter set forth in this Guaranty which pertain to California law are included solely out of an abundance of caution, and shall not be construed to mean that any of the
above-referenced provisions of California law are in any way applicable to this Guaranty or the Obligations.  10.04 Obligations
Independent. The respective obligations of each of Holdings and the US Borrower hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate
action may be brought against Holdings, the US Borrower or both to enforce this Guaranty whether or not any Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party. 
  97 


10.05 Subrogation. Neither Holdings nor the US Borrower shall exercise any right of
subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been paid and performed in full and the
Commitments and the Facilities are terminated. If any amounts are paid to Holdings or the US Borrower in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and shall forthwith be
paid to the Guaranteed Parties to reduce the amount of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.  10.06 Termination;
Reinstatement. This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Loan Document Obligations (other than any contingent indemnification or
similar contingent obligation not yet due and payable) and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty (other than any contingent indemnification or similar contingent obligation not yet due and payable) are paid in full in cash and the
Commitments and the Facilities with respect to the Loan Document Obligations are terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of
the Borrowers or Holdings is made, or any of the Guaranteed Parties exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Loan Document Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared
to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any of the Guaranteed Parties in their discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any
proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Guaranteed Parties are in possession of or have released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior
revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The respective obligations of Holdings and the US Borrower under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty. 
10.07 Subordination. (a) Holdings hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of any Borrower owing
to Holdings and (b) the US Borrower hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of the Cayman Borrower owing to the US Borrower, in each case, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any
obligation of (x) any Borrower to Holdings or (y) the Cayman Borrower to the US Borrower, as subrogee of the Guaranteed Parties or resulting from Holdings or the US Borrowers performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible
payment in full in cash of all Obligations. If the Guaranteed Parties so request following the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, any such obligation or indebtedness of any Borrower to Holdings or to the US Borrower shall
be enforced, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the respective liability of Holdings or the US Borrower under this Guaranty. 
10.08 Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed, in connection with any
case commenced by or against Holdings or any Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by Holdings or the US Borrower promptly upon demand by the Guaranteed Parties. 
  98 


10.09 Condition of Borrowers. Holdings and the US Borrower each acknowledges and
agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrowers and any other guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrowers and any such other
guarantor as Holdings or the US Borrower requires, and that none of the Guaranteed Parties has any duty, and neither Holdings nor the US Borrower is relying on the Guaranteed Parties at any time, to disclose to Holdings or the US Borrower any
information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of any Borrower or any other guarantor (Holdings and the US Borrower each waiving any duty on the part of the Guaranteed Parties to disclose such information and any defense
relating to the failure to provide the same).  10.10 Keepwell. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor party hereto hereby jointly and
severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Guarantor that would otherwise not be an eligible contract participant as defined in
the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder to honor all of its obligations under this Agreement in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this
Section 10.10 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 10.10 or otherwise under this Agreement voidable under applicable law relating to
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 10.10 shall remain in full force and effect until the indefeasible payment in full in cash
of all the Obligations. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 10.10 constitute, and this Section 10.10 shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of
each other Loan Party for all purposes of Section la(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.  ARTICLE XI. 
MISCELLANEOUS  11.01
Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by the Borrowers or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the

be satisfied);  (b) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate any Commitment terminated pursuant to
Section 8.02) without the written consent of such Lender;  (c) postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan

Section 2.06(b), without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby; 
  99 


(d) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on, any Loan or L/C
Borrowing, or (subject to clause (iv) of the second proviso to this Section 11.01) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;
provided that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary (i) to amend the definition of Default Rate or to waive any obligation of the Borrowers to pay interest or Letter of Credit Fees at the Default Rate or
(ii) to amend any financial covenant hereunder (or any defined term used therein) even if the effect of such amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or L/C Borrowing or to reduce any fee payable hereunder; 
(e) change Section 8.03 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent
of each Lender;  (f) change (i) any provision of this Section 11.01 or the definition of Required Lenders or
any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class) required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder (other than the
definition(s) specified in Section 11.01(f)(ii)) without the written consent of each Lender (or each Lender of such Class, as the case may be) and (ii) the definition of Required Revolving Credit Lenders without the
written consent of each Revolving Credit Lender;  (g) release (i) Holdings or the US Borrower from the Guaranty in Article X hereof or
(ii) all or substantially all of the value of the Subsidiary Guaranty, in either case, without the written consent of each Lender, except to the extent the release of any Subsidiary Guarantor is permitted pursuant to Section 9.10
(in which case such release may be made by the Administrative Agent acting alone);  (h) change any provisions of any Loan Document in a
manner that by its terms adversely affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders holding Loans of any Class differently than those holding Loans of any other Class, without the written consent of Lenders representing the Majority in
Interest of each such adversely affected Class; or  (i) impose any greater restriction on the ability of any Lender under a Facility to
assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the written consent of such Lender; 
  100 


and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by the L/C Issuer in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the L/C Issuer under this Agreement or any Issuer Document relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by it; (ii) no amendment,
waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Swing Line Lender in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Swing Line Lender under this Agreement; (iii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall,
unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and (iv) each of the Fee Letters may be
amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender or Excluded Term Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any
amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders),
except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by
its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent on its behalf, and without further consent, to enter into amendments or modifications to this Agreement (including amendments to this
Section 11.01 and/or Section 2.13) or any of the other Loan Documents or to enter into additional Loan Documents as the Administrative Agent reasonably deems appropriate in order to effectuate the terms of any amendment which
extends the Maturity Date for such Lenders that have approved such extension of any Facility with respect to fewer than all of the Lenders (including any terms therein which provide for a higher interest rate and/or fees to be paid to each Lender
agreeing to extend its maturity date); provided that (a) such amendment has been approved by the Required Lenders and each Lender required to approve such amendment pursuant to Section 11.01(c) and (b) no amendment or
modification shall result in any increase in the amount of any Lenders Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitment or any increase in any Lenders Applicable Percentage without the consent of such Lender. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended (or amended and restated), modified or
supplemented with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, Holdings, the Borrowers and the applicable Lenders (i) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this Agreement with respect to the Incremental Commitments and
Incremental Term Loans, (ii) to permit the extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with
the Loans, as applicable, and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (iii) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders and Majority in Interest; provided,
that the conditions set forth in Section 2.14 are satisfied.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if following the Closing Date, the
Administrative Agent, Holdings and the Borrowers shall have jointly identified an inconsistency, error or omission of a technical or immaterial nature, in each case, in any provision of the Loan Documents, then the Administrative Agent and the Loan
Parties shall be permitted to amend such provision and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Loan Documents if the same is not objected to in writing by the Required Lenders within ten
Business Days following receipt of notice thereof. 
  101 


If any Lender does not consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, consent or release with respect to any Loan
Document that requires the consent of such Lender and that has been approved by the Required Lenders or the Required Revolving Credit Lenders, as the case may be, the Borrowers may replace such non-consenting Lender in accordance with
Section 11.13; provided that such amendment, waiver, consent or release can be effected as a result of the assignment contemplated by such Section (together with all other such assignments required by the Borrowers to be made
pursuant to this paragraph).  11.02 Notices; Effectiveness; Electronic Communication. 
(a) Notices Generally. Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone (and except

(ii) if to any other Lender, to the address, telecopier number, electronic mail address or telephone number specified in its
Administrative Questionnaire (including, as appropriate, notices delivered solely to the Person designated by a Lender on its Administrative Questionnaire then in effect for the delivery of notices that may contain material non-public information
relating to Holdings and its Subsidiaries).  Notices and other communications sent by hand or overnight courier service, or mailed by certified or
registered mail, shall be deemed to have been given when received; notices and other communications sent by telecopier shall be deemed to have been given when sent (except that, if not given during normal business hours for the recipient, shall be
deemed to have been given at the opening of business on the next business day for the recipient). Notices and other communications delivered through electronic communications to the extent provided in subsection (b) below, shall be effective as
provided in such subsection (b).  (b) Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer
hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to
any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to Article II if such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication. The
Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Loan Parties may, in their discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it;
provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications. 
  102 


Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications
sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the senders receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the return receipt requested function, as available, return e-mail or other written
acknowledgement); provided that if such notice or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next
business day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause
(i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor.  (c) The
Platform. THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE. THE AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM
FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties)
have any liability to Holdings, the Borrowers, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of Holdings, the
Borrowers or the Administrative Agents transmission of Borrower Materials through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a
final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to Holdings, the Borrowers, any Lender, the L/C Issuer
or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages).  (d)
Change of Address, Etc. Each of Holdings, the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender may change its address, telecopier or telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the
other parties hereto. Each other Lender may change its address, telecopier or telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender. In
addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record (i) an effective address, contact name, telephone number, telecopier number and electronic mail address to
which notices and other communications may be sent and (ii) accurate wire instructions for such Lender. Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected
the Private Side Information or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lenders compliance procedures and
applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws, to make reference to Borrower Materials that are not made available through the Public Side Information portion of the Platform and that may contain material
non-public information with respect to Holdings and its Subsidiaries or their respective securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws. 
  103 


(e) Reliance by Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and Lenders. The Administrative Agent,
the L/C Issuer and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including telephonic Loan Notices and Swing Line Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of any Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a
manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. Each Borrower shall
indemnify the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, each Lender and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of
such Borrower. All telephonic notices to and other telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording. 
11.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies; Enforcement. No failure by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent to exercise,
and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder or under any other Loan Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan
Document, are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all
actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 8.02 for the benefit of all the Lenders and the L/C Issuer;
provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents, (b) the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be) hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents, (c) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 11.08 (subject to the terms of Section 2.13) or (d) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on
its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Loan Party under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of the
preceding proviso and subject to Section 2.13, any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders. 
  104 


11.04 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. 
(a) Costs and Expenses. The Borrowers shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented costs and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Arranger and their Affiliates (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one firm of outside counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Arranger and of appropriate local counsel, if any, limited to one
such firm of outside counsel in each jurisdiction), in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents

absent an actual or perceived conflict of interest, and any necessary local or foreign counsel (limited to one or, in the case of a conflict of interest, two such firms of outside local and foreign counsel in each jurisdiction)), in connection with
the enforcement or protection of its rights (A) in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or (B) in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder,
including all such documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit (including any Cayman Islands stamp duty that may become payable on this Agreement or any
other Loan Document).  (b) Indemnification by the Borrowers. The Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any
sub-agent thereof), each Lender and the L/C Issuer, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one firm of outside counsel for the Administrative Agent and one firm of outside counsel for the other Indemnitees, taken together, absent an
actual or perceived conflict of interest, and any necessary local or foreign counsel (limited to one or, in the case of a conflict of interest, two such firms of outside local or foreign counsel in each jurisdiction), and shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnitee from all reasonable fees and time charges and disbursements for attorneys who may be employees of any Indemnitee, incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by Holdings, the Borrowers

hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the

refusal by the L/C Issuer to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of 
  105 



such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by a Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
Environmental Liability related in any way to a Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other
theory, whether brought by a third party or by a Borrower or any other Loan Party, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available (A) to the extent
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith (including a material breach by such
Indemnitee of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document) or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (B) in the case of disputes solely between or among Indemnitees (except that in the event of such dispute involving
a claim or proceeding brought against the Administrative Agent or the Arranger (in each case, in its capacity as such) by the other Indemnitees, the Administrative Agent or the Arranger (in each case, in its capacity as such), as applicable, shall
be entitled (subject to the other limitations and exceptions set forth in this proviso) to the benefit of such indemnities) not relating to or in connection with acts or omissions by Holdings, any Borrower, any other Loan Party or any of the their
respective Affiliates. This Section 11.04(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses or damages arising from any non-Tax claim; provided, however, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) this
Section 11.04(b) shall not apply to Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 or Excluded Taxes imposed on any payment of interest or fees and (B) the amount of Taxes that represent losses or damages from
any non-Tax claim shall take into account whether (and to what extent) the Indemnitee is entitled to take a deduction in respect of the payment of the non-Tax claim and whether (and to what extent) the receipt of the indemnity payment by such
Indemnitee is taxable to such Indemnitee.  (c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrowers for any reason fail to
indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer, the Swing Line Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing,
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer, the Swing Line Lender or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the
applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C
Issuer or the Swing Line Lender in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.12(d). 
  106 


(d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, and without derogating the Indemnitees rights to indemnity under this Section, Holdings and the Borrowers, on one hand, and the Indemnitees, on the other hand, shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any of the others on
any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, the Transactions, including any transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages
arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  (e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten
Business Days after demand therefor.  (f) Survival. The agreements in this Section and the indemnity provisions of
Section 11.02(e) shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or
discharge of all the other Obligations.  11.05 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of a Borrower is
made to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party,
in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as
if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and the L/C Issuer severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from
or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders and the L/C
Issuer under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
11.06 Successors and Assigns. 
(a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and thereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that, other than in a transaction permitted under Section 6.04 or 7.02 hereof, neither the Borrowers nor any other
Loan Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section or (iii) by way of
pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
  107 


(b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all
or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing
Line Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that (in each case with respect to any Facility) any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(i) Minimum Amounts. 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment under any Facility
and the Loans at the time owing to it under such Facility or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
(B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this
purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and
Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000, in the case of any assignment
in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, or $1,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of a Term Loan Facility unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrowers
otherwise consent (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee
(or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met. 
(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not (A) apply to the Swing Line Lenders rights and obligations in respect of
Swing Line Loans or (B) prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Facilities on a non-pro rata basis; 
  108 


(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment
except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:  (A) the consent of the Borrowers
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved
Fund; provided that the Borrowers shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received notice thereof;
 (B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required
for assignments in respect of (1) any Term Commitment or any Revolving Credit Commitment if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender with a Commitment in respect of the applicable Facility, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved
Fund with respect to such Lender or (2) any Term Loan to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; 
(C) the consent of the L/C Issuer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any
assignment that increases the obligation of the assignee to participate in exposure under one or more Letters of Credit (whether or not then outstanding); and 
(D) the consent of the Swing Line Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any
assignment in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility.  (iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect
to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. 
(v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Borrowers or any of the
Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B) or
(C) to a natural person. 
  109 


(vi) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of
rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the
Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with
the consent of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to
(x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full
pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender
hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance
occurs.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under
this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all
of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 11.04 with
respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Upon request, each applicable Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note or Notes to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection
(d) of this Section.  (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of each Borrower (and
such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Commitments of, and principal amounts of (and interest on) the Loans and L/C Obligations owing by each Borrower to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available for inspection by each Loan
Party and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
  110 


(d) Participations. (i) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice
to, the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, a Defaulting Lender or a Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in
all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lenders participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to
it); provided that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the
Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. 
(ii) Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall
retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of
the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 11.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to clause (e) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section; provided such
Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.06 as though it were a Lender. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender.  (iii) Each Lender that sells
a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the applicable Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents owing to each Borrower (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of
the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to
the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) or 1.871-14(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. Any
participation of a Loan shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Participant Register. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. 
(e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless (A) the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrowers prior written consent or (B) such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable Participation and such Participant shall have otherwise complied
with Section 3.01(e). A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrowers are notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the
Borrowers, to comply with Section 3.01(e) as though it were a Lender. 
  111 


(f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or
assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
(g) Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender after Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at
any time JPMCB assigns all of its Revolving Credit Commitment and Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, JPMCB may, (i) upon 30 days notice to the Borrowers and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or
(ii) upon 30 days notice to the Borrowers, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the Borrowers shall be entitled to appoint, from among the Lenders willing to serve in such
capacity, a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided that no failure by the Borrowers to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of JPMCB as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be. If JPMCB
resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with
respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). If JPMCB resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights
of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations
in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c). Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make
other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to JPMCB to effectively assume the obligations of JPMCB with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
  112 


11.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders and the L/C Issuer agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates respective partners, directors,
officers, employees, agents, trustees, advisors and representatives on a need to know basis and only in connection with the transactions described herein (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the
confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions
substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or any Eligible Assignee invited to be a Lender
pursuant to Section 2.14(c) or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction or to any credit insurance provider relating to the Borrowers and their obligations, (g) with
the consent of the Borrowers or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the
L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrowers who is not known by the Person to whom such Information has become available to be bound by a confidentiality agreement or other
confidentiality obligation to the Borrowers with respect to such Information. For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from any Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrowers or any Subsidiary
or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Borrower or any Subsidiary; provided
that, in the case of information received from any Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information
as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.  Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that (a) the
Information may include material non-public information concerning Holdings or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such
material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws.  11.08
Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, the L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, after obtaining the prior written consent
of the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in
whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of a Borrower or any other Loan Party against any and all of the obligations of the Borrowers or such Loan Party now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although
such obligations of such Borrower or such Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or the L/C Issuer different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness;
provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.16 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and (y) the Defaulting
Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender, the L/C Issuer and their
respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer agrees to notify the
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  
  113 


11.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any
Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender
shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the applicable Borrower. In determining whether the interest
contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium
rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations of
the applicable Borrower hereunder.  11.10 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, and the other Loan Documents constitute
the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01,
this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties
hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or other electronic imaging means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 
11.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties; Termination.  
(a) All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or
in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, regardless of any
investigation made by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit
Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation (other than any contingent indemnification or similar contingent obligation not yet due or payable) hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or
any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding. 
  114 


(b) This Agreement, the Guaranty and the other Loan Documents shall terminate, be released and
have no further force or effect when all the Loan Document Obligations (other than any contingent indemnification obligations or similar contingent obligation not yet due and payable) have been paid in full in cash, the Lenders have no further
commitment to lend under this Agreement, the L/C Obligations have been reduced to zero (or have been Cash Collateralized) and the L/C Issuer has no further obligation to issue, amend or extend Letters of Credit under this Agreement; provided
that those provisions that are expressly specified in this Agreement or in any Loan Document as surviving that respective agreements termination or the repayment of the Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Agreement or any
other Loan Documents shall survive without prejudice and remain in full force and effect.  (c) In connection with any termination or
release pursuant to Section 11.11(b), the Lenders and the L/C Issuer irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver to any Loan Party, at such Loan Partys expense, all documents that such Loan Party shall
reasonably request to evidence such termination or release. Any execution and delivery of documents by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 11.11(c) shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent. 
11.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable,
(a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating
to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent
not so limited.  11.13 Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04 or is unable to
make Eurodollar Rate Loans pursuant to Section 3.02, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any
Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if the last paragraph of Section 11.01 applies to such Lender, or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrowers the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto pursuant to this
Section, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained
in, and consents required by, Section 11.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:  (a) the Administrative Agent shall have received the assignment
fee specified in Section 11.06(b)(iv); 
  115 


(b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to 100% of the outstanding
principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent
of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts);  (c) in the case of any
such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
 (d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws. 
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver or consent by such Lender
or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an
Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto. 
11.14 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc. 
(a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
(b) SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY, TO THE
NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN CITY OF NEW YORK, BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND ANY APPELLATE COURT FROM ANY THEREOF, IN ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR FOR RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH
ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH NEW YORK STATE COURT OR, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,

ected to, make a general reference pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure
Section 638 to a referee (who shall be a single active or retired judge) to hear and determine all of the issues in such action or proceeding (whether of fact or of law) and to report a statement of decision; provided that at the option
of any party to such proceeding, any such issues pertaining to a provisional remedy as defined in California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.8 shall be heard and determined by the court, and (b) without limiting the
generality of Section 11.04, the Borrowers shall be solely responsible to pay all fees and expenses of any referee appointed in such action or proceeding. 
  117 


11.17 Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is
necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the
first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the
other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the Judgment Currency) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the Agreement
Currency), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or
such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender from any Borrower in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against
such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the
amount of any excess to such Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).  11.18 No
Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), each Borrower and each
other Loan Party acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates understanding, that: (a) (i) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent and any Affiliate thereof,
the Arranger, the Bookrunners and the Lenders are arms-length commercial transactions between the Borrowers, each other Loan Party and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and, as applicable, its
Affiliates (including the Arranger) and the Lenders and their Affiliates (including the Bookrunners) (collectively, solely for purposes of this Section 11.18, the Lenders), on the other hand, (ii) each Borrower
and each other Loan Party has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate and (iii) each Borrower and each other Loan Party is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the
terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (b) (i) each of the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates (including the Arranger) and each Lender is and has been acting solely as a
principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates, or any other
Person and (ii) neither the Administrative Agent, any of its Affiliates (including the Arranger) nor any Lender has any obligation to the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (c) the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates (including the Arranger) and the Lenders may be engaged in a broad range of
transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrowers, the other Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent, any of its Affiliates (including the Arranger) nor any Lender has any
obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties hereby waives and releases any claims
that it may have against the Administrative Agent, any of its Affiliates (including the Arranger) or any Lender with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated
hereby. 
  118 


11.19 Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents. The words
execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption or in any amendment or other modification hereof (including waivers and consents) shall be deemed to include electronic
signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent
and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic
Transactions Act.  11.20 USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender that is subject to the Patriot Act and the Administrative Agent (for
itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Borrower and each other Loan Party, which
information includes the name and address of each Borrower and each other Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify each Borrower and each other Loan Party in accordance with
the Patriot Act. Each Borrower and each other Loan Party shall, promptly following a request by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all documentation and other information that the Administrative Agent or such Lender requests in order to
comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act.

EXHIBIT F 
[FORM OF] SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY 
THIS SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, this Guaranty), dated
as of January 9, 2014, is made by certain Domestic Subsidiaries of Holdings (as defined below) as identified on the signature pages hereto and any Additional Guarantor (as defined below) who may become a party to this Guaranty (such signatories
and the Additional Guarantors, collectively, the Guarantors and individually, a Guarantor), in favor of JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., as Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the Administrative
Agent) for the ratable benefit of itself and the Guaranteed Parties (as defined in the Credit Agreement identified below). 
Pursuant to the Credit Agreement dated as of the date hereof (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the
Credit Agreement), among Western Digital Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the US Borrower), Western Digital Ireland, Ltd., an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the
Cayman Borrower and, together with the US Borrower, the Borrowers), Western Digital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Holdings), the Lenders from time to time party thereto, and the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer have agreed to make Credit Extensions to the Borrowers upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. 
Each Guarantor will materially benefit from the Credit Extensions made and to be made under the Credit Agreement. 
Each Guarantor is required to enter into this Guaranty pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. 
For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by the parties hereto, and to induce the
Administrative Agent and the other Guaranteed Parties to make their respective Credit Extensions and other financial accommodations under the Loan Documents, the Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements or the Guaranteed Hedge Agreements, the
Guarantors hereby agree with the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Guaranteed Parties, as follows:  1. Defined
Terms. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Credit Agreement. The following terms when used herein shall have the meanings set forth below: 
Additional Guarantor means each Person which hereafter becomes a Guarantor pursuant to Section 20 hereof and
Section 6.11 of the Credit Agreement. 
  Exhibit F - Page 1 


Contribution Share means, for any Guarantor in respect of any Excess Payment
made by any other Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such Excess Payment of (a) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and
liabilities of such Guarantor (including probable contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (b) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value
of all assets and other properties of the Guarantors other than the maker of such Excess Payment exceeds the amount of all of the debts and liabilities (including probable contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but
excluding the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder) of the Guarantors other than the maker of such Excess Payment; provided that for purposes of calculating the Contribution Shares of the Guarantors in respect of any Excess Payment, any
Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to the date of any such Excess Payment shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the date of such Excess Payment and the financial information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a
Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such Excess Payment.  Excess Payment means the amount
paid by any Guarantor in excess of its Ratable Share of any Guaranteed Obligations.  Guaranteed Obligations has the
meaning set forth in Section 2.  Ratable Share means, for any Guarantor in respect of any payment of
Guaranteed Obligations, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such payment of Guaranteed Obligations of (a) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of
all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including probable contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (b) the amount by which the aggregate present fair
salable value of all assets and other properties of all of the Guarantors exceeds the amount of all of the debts and liabilities (including probable contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of
the Guarantors hereunder) of the Guarantors; provided that for purposes of calculating the Ratable Shares of the Guarantors in respect of any payment of Guaranteed Obligations, any Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to the date of
any such payment shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the date of such payment and the financial information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such
payment.  2. Guaranty. Each Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and
not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all Obligations of the Loan Parties, whether for
principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise, to the Guaranteed Parties, and whether arising under any the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, any Guaranteed Cash Management Agreement or any
Guaranteed Hedge Agreement (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys fees and expenses incurred by the Guaranteed Parties in connection with the collection or
enforcement thereof (collectively, the Guaranteed Obligations). The books and records of the Administrative Agent and the books and records of each Guaranteed Party showing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be
admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. This Guaranty shall not be affected
by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any
collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty, and such Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses
it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder at any time shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal
to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code) or any comparable provisions of any
similar federal or state law. 
  Exhibit F - Page 2 


3. No Setoff or Deductions; Taxes; Payments. Each Guarantor shall make all payments
hereunder without setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of and without deduction for any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, withholdings, compulsory loans, restrictions or conditions of any nature now or hereafter imposed
or levied by any jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or taxing or other authority therein unless such Guarantor is compelled by applicable Law to make such deduction or withholding and each Guarantor shall, jointly and severally, pay
and indemnify each Guaranteed Party for Taxes (other than Excluded Taxes) and Other Taxes to the extent any Borrower would be required to do so pursuant to Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement. The obligations of each Guarantor under
this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.  4. Rights of
Guaranteed Parties. Each Guarantor consents and agrees that the Guaranteed Parties may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a) amend,
extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise
dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Guaranteed Obligations, (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Guaranteed Parties in their sole discretion may determine and (d) release
or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner
or to any extent vary the risks of such Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Guarantor. 
5. Certain Waivers. Each Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any Borrower or
any other Guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Guaranteed Party) of the liability of any Borrower other than indefeasible payment and performance in full of the Guaranteed Obligations,
(b) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantors obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of any Borrower, (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantors liability hereunder,
(d) any right to proceed, or to require any Guaranteed Party to proceed against any Borrower, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the power of any Guaranteed Party whatsoever,
(e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by any Guaranteed Party and (f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by
applicable Law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties. Each Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance,
protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or
incurrence of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor waives any rights and defenses that are or may become available to such Guarantor by reason of §§ 2787 to 2855, inclusive, and §§ 2899 and 3433 of the
California Civil Code. As provided below, this Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The foregoing waivers and the provisions hereinafter set forth in this Guaranty which pertain to
California law are included solely out of an abundance of caution, and shall not be construed to mean that any of the above-referenced provisions of California law are in any way applicable to this Guaranty or the Guaranteed Obligations. 
  Exhibit F - Page 3 


6. Obligations Independent. The respective obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are
those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations and the obligations of any other Guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against each Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not any
Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party.  7. Subrogation. Each Guarantor shall not exercise any right of
subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and
performed in full and the Commitments and the Facilities are terminated. If any amounts are paid to any Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and shall
forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of itself and the other Guaranteed Parties) to reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. 
8. Contribution. Subject to Section 7, each Guarantor hereby agrees with each other Guarantor that if any Guarantor shall
make an Excess Payment, such Guarantor shall have a right of contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantors Contribution Share of such Excess Payment. The payment obligations of any Guarantor under this
Section shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the Guaranteed Obligations until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full, and no Guarantor shall exercise any right or remedy under
this Section against any other Guarantor until such Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full. Each Guarantor recognizes and acknowledges that the rights to contribution arising hereunder shall constitute an asset in
favor of the party entitled to such contribution. This Section shall not be deemed to affect any right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution that any Guarantor may have under applicable Law against any Borrower in respect of any
payment of Guaranteed Obligations.  9. Termination; Reinstatement. This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all
Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Loan Document Obligations (other than any contingent indemnification or similar contingent obligation not yet due and payable) and any other amounts
payable under this Guaranty (other than any contingent indemnification or similar contingent obligation not yet due and payable) are indefeasibly paid in full in cash and the Commitments and the Facilities with respect to the Loan Document
Obligations are terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of a Borrower or any Guarantor is made, or any Guaranteed Party
exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Loan Document Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including
pursuant to any settlement entered into by any Guaranteed Party in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not
been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not any Guaranteed Party is in possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The obligations of each Guarantor under
this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty. 
  Exhibit F - Page 4 


10. Subordination. Each Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and
indebtedness of any Borrower owing to such Guarantor, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of a Borrower to such Guarantor as subrogee of any Guaranteed Party or resulting from such Guarantors
performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations; provided that a Borrower may make ordinary course payments pursuant to such Borrowers and its Subsidiaries cash management
system unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. If the Administrative Agent so requests when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any such obligation or indebtedness of any Borrower to any Guarantor shall be
enforced, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty.  11. Stay of
Acceleration. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against any Borrower or any Guarantor under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise,
all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by such Guarantor promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent.  12. Condition of
Borrowers. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrowers and any other Guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and
operations of the Borrowers and any such other guarantor as such Guarantor requires, and that no Guaranteed Party has a duty, and such Guarantor is not relying on any Guaranteed Party at any time, to disclose to such Guarantor any information
relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrowers or any other guarantor (the guarantor waiving any duty on the part of any Guaranteed Parties to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide
the same).  13. Keepwell. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor party hereto jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be necessary from time to time by each other Guarantor that would otherwise not be an eligible contract participant as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act and the
regulations thereunder to honor all of its obligations under this Guaranty in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 13 for the maximum amount of such liability
that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 13 or otherwise under this Guaranty voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The
obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 13 shall remain in full force and effect until the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this
Section 13 constitute, and this Section 13 shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of each Loan Party for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange
Act. 
  Exhibit F - Page 5 


14. Representations and Warranties. Each Guarantor represents and warrants that each
representation and warranty contained in Article V of the Credit Agreement relating to such Guarantor is true and correct in all material respects (or, with respect to representations and warranties modified by materiality standards, in all
respects) as if made by such Guarantor herein.  15. Amendments, Waivers and Consents. None of the terms or provisions of this
Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, nor any consent be given, except in accordance with Section 11.01 of the Credit Agreement. 
16. Notices. All notices and communications hereunder or under any Joinder Agreement shall be given to the addresses and otherwise made
in accordance with Section 11.02 of the Credit Agreement; provided that notices and communications to the Guarantors shall be directed to the Guarantors, at the address of Holdings set forth in Schedule 11.02 of the Credit
Agreement.  17. Expenses; Indemnification and Survival. The Guarantors shall, jointly and severally, (a) pay all documented
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by the Administrative Agent and each other Guaranteed Party in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights
in connection with this Guaranty and (b) indemnify each Indemnitee, in each case, to the extent the Borrowers would be required to do so pursuant to Section 11.04 of the Credit Agreement. The obligations of the Guarantors under this
paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Guaranty in accordance with its terms. 
18. Right of Setoff; Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Venue; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Without limiting the general applicability of the foregoing and the terms of the other Loan Documents to this Guaranty and the parties hereto, the terms of Sections 11.08,
11.12, 11.14, 11.15 and 11.16 of the Credit Agreement are incorporated herein by reference, mutatis mutandis, with each reference to a Borrower or the Borrowers therein (whether express or
by reference to a Borrower or the Borrowers as party thereto) being a reference to each Guarantor, and the parties hereto agree to such terms. 
19. Counterparts; Electronic Execution. This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Guaranty by telecopy or other electronic imaging
means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Guaranty.  20. Additional Guarantors. At any time
after the date of this Guaranty, one or more additional Persons may become a party hereto by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent a Joinder Agreement pursuant to Section 6.11 of the Credit Agreement. Immediately upon such
execution and delivery of such Joinder Agreement (and without any further action, each such additional Person will become a party to this Guaranty as a Guarantor and have all of the rights and obligations of a Guarantor hereunder and
this Guaranty shall be deemed amended by such Joinder Agreement. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a form of Joinder Agreement. 
  Exhibit F - Page 6 


21. Discharge of Guaranty. If any Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary or Material Domestic
Subsidiary of Holdings as a result of a transaction permitted under the Credit Agreement, such Guarantor (or Holdings or any Borrower) may request the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver documents or instruments necessary to evidence the
release and discharge of such Guarantor from this Guaranty as provided in Section 9.11 of the Credit Agreement.  22.
