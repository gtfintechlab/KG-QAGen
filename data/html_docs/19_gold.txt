Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of such Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Applicable Participants that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests -31-may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.  The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.(d)    Any Swingline Lender may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the successor Swingline Lender and, to the extent affecting the rights or obligations of the replaced Swingline Lender, such replaced Swingline Lender.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of a Swingline Lender.  At the time any such replacement shall become effective the Borrower shall pay all unpaid interest accrued for the account of the replaced Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a).  From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (x) the successor Swingline Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Swingline Lender under this Agreement with respect to Swingline Loans made thereafter and (y) references herein to the term “Swingline Lender” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Swingline Lender, or to such successor and all previous Swingline Lenders, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of a Swingline Lender hereunder, the replaced Swingline Lender shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of a Swingline Lender under this Agreement with respect to Swingline Loans made by it prior to its replacement, but shall not be required to make additional Swingline Loans.(e)    Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Swingline Lender, any Swingline Lender may resign as a Swingline Lender at any time upon thirty days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders, in which case, such Swingline Lender shall be replaced in accordance with Section 2.04(d) above.SECTION 2.05.    Letters of Credit. (a)    General.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or (provided that any Letter of Credit may be provided on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower; provided that in each such case, the Borrower (i) will be primarily liable for any such Letters of Credit and (ii) shall be required to reimburse any LC Disbursement issued for the account of a Subsidiary to the same extent as if such LC Disbursement was issued for the account of the Borrower), in a form reasonably acceptable to the relevant Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period.  In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, an Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.(b)    Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions.  To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the relevant Issuing Bank) to the relevant Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension; provided that in the case of any request for an issuance of letters of credit, such notice shall be provided at least three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date of such issuance) a notice in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B‑3 requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit.  The relevant -32-Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of, and the Administrative Agent shall in turn promptly furnish to the Lenders notice of, any such issuance.  If requested by the relevant Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank’s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit; provided that such letter of credit application shall not contain terms inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and shall not impose any additional obligations, liabilities or Liens on any Loan Party during the term of this Agreement.  A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed the LC Exposure Sublimit, (ii) unless otherwise agreed by the relevant Issuing Bank in its sole discretion, the LC Exposure of each Issuing Bank shall not exceed such Issuing Bank’s LC Commitment, (iii) subject to Section 2.04, the total Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total Revolving Commitments and (iv) the total Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the lesser of (x) the total Revolving Commitments and (y) the Availability Limit.  The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, reduce the LC Commitment of any Issuing Bank with the consent of such Issuing Bank; provided that the Borrower shall not reduce the LC Commitment of any Issuing Bank if, after giving effect of such reduction, the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) above shall not be satisfied.(c)    Expiration Date.  Each Letter of Credit shall, unless otherwise agreed by the relevant Issuing Bank, expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date that is one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, or, in each case, such later date as the relevant Issuing Bank may agree, to the extent such Letters of Credit are cash collateralized or backstopped in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Issuing Bank; provided that in the event that an Issuing Bank consents to an expiration date for any Letter of Credit that is following the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the Applicable Participants shall cease to have risk participations therein on (x) the day following the Revolving Credit Maturity Date or (y) on such later date through which such Letter of Credit is deemed to be outstanding in accordance with Section 1.03.(d)    Participations.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof or renewing such Letter of Credit or extending the expiration thereof) and without any further action on the part of the relevant Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Applicable Participant, and each Applicable Participant hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Applicable Participant’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount from time to time available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Applicable Participant hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars, for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank, such Applicable Participant’s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.  Each Applicable Participant acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment made in accordance with this Section 2.05(d) by the Applicable Participant for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.-33-(e)    Reimbursement.  If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., Local Time, on the day of receipt or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that unless the Borrower elects otherwise, the Borrower shall be deemed, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, to have requested in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or, if such amount is less than the Borrowing Multiple, a Swingline Loan issued in the amount of such LC Disbursement and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan.  If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due (or if any such reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason), then the Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Issuing Bank and each Applicable Participant of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Applicable Participant’s Applicable Percentage thereof.  Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Applicable Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Applicable Participants), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the relevant Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Applicable Participants.  Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the relevant Issuing Bank or, to the extent that the Applicable Participants have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Applicable Participants and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by an Applicable Participant pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.(f)    Obligations Absolute.  The Borrower’s obligations to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the relevant Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower’s obligations hereunder.  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Banks, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the relevant Issuing Bank; provided that nothing in this Section (f) shall be construed to excuse the relevant Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the relevant Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise reasonable care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence -34-of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the relevant Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.(g)    Disbursement Procedures.  The relevant Issuing Bank shall, within the period as per terms and conditions of Letter of Credit but in any event promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit.  After examination of such documents, the relevant Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or transmission by electronic communication in accordance with Section 9.01(b)) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the relevant Issuing Bank and the Applicable Participants with respect to any such LC Disbursement (other than with respect to the timing of such reimbursement obligation set forth in clause (e) of this Section).(h)    Interim Interest.  If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(c) shall apply.  Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Applicable Participant pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Applicable Participant to the extent of such payment.(i)    Replacement or Addition of Issuing Bank.  (i)    Any Issuing Bank may be replaced, or the LC Commitment (or a portion thereof) of any Issuing Bank assigned, at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the successor or assignee Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank.  At the time any such replacement or assignment shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced or assigning Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b).  From and after the effective date of any such replacement or assignment, (i) the successor or assignee Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the assigning Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or assignee or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of an Issuing Bank or the assignment of an LC Commitment hereunder, the replaced or assigning Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement or with respect to its remaining LC Commitment (if any), but, in the case of a replacement, shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.  A Lender may become an additional Issuing Bank hereunder at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Lender.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such additional Issuing Bank.-35-(ii)    Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, any Issuing Bank may resign as an Issuing Bank at any time upon thirty days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders, in which case, such Issuing Bank shall be replaced in accordance with Section 2.05(i)(i) above.(j)    Cash Collateralization.  If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit and thereafter maintain in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Applicable Participants, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure from time to time plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in paragraph (h) or (i) of Article VII.  The Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.22(a)(iii) or such other applicable provisions of this Agreement.  Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement.  The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.  Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the Borrower’s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Monies in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the relevant Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure, at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of the Required Lenders), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Documents.  If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder, such amount (or any lesser amount no longer required to remain as cash collateral pursuant to this Agreement) plus any accrued interest or realized profits with respect to such amounts (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to such Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived or such collateral is no longer required pursuant to this Agreement.SECTION 2.06.    Funding of Borrowings. (a)    Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 2:00 p.m., New York City time to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders in an amount equal to such Lender’s Loan to be made on such date; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04.  Except in respect of the provisions of this Agreement covering the reimbursement of Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the funds so received in the aforesaid account of the Administrative Agent, to an account designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request, in New York City, provided that Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Applicable Participants have made payments pursuant to Section 2.05(e) to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Applicable Participants and the applicable Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.(b)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available -36-on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.SECTION 2.07.    Interest Elections. (a)    Subject to Section 2.02(b), each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.07.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.  This Section shall not apply to Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued.(b)    To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.  Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy or transmission by electronic communication in accordance with Section 9.01(b) to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form attached hereto as Exhibit B‑2 or such other form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, this Section 2.07 shall not be construed to permit the Borrower to (i) elect an Interest Period for Eurocurrency Loans that does not comply with Section 2.02(d) or (ii) convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a Type not available under the Class of Commitments pursuant to which such Borrowing was made.(c)    Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:(i)    the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies, the relevant currency, and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);(ii)    the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;(iii)    whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and-37-(iv)    if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which Interest Period shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period.”If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.(d)    Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.(e)    If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month’s duration.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.SECTION 2.08.    Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a)    Unless previously terminated, all Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.  The Extended Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the respective maturity dates applicable thereto.(b)    The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Commitments of any Class; provided that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 (or, if less, the remaining amount of such Commitments), and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the aggregate Revolving Exposures (excluding, the portion of the Revolving Exposures attributable to outstanding Letters of Credit, if and to the extent that the Borrower has made arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit, and such Issuing Bank has released the Applicable Participants from their participation obligations with respect to such Letters of Credit) would exceed the lesser of (x) the aggregate Revolving Commitments and (y) the Availability Limit.(c)    The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or instruments of Indebtedness or other transaction, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Any termination or reduction of the Revolving Commitments of any Class shall be permanent.  Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments of any Class shall, except as provided in Section 2.20, be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments of such Class.-38-SECTION 2.09.    Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a)    The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender, the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan made to such Borrower on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date in Dollars and to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan in Dollars on the earlier of the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and the date that is five (5) Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a Revolving Loan is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding.(b)    Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.(c)    The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.(d)    The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein absent manifest error; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.(e)    Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by promissory notes.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender promissory notes payable to such Lender and its registered assigns and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory notes and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04 of this Agreement) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein and its registered assigns.SECTION 2.10.    Prepayment of Loans. (a)    Optional Prepayments.(i)    The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing of any Class in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 2.10.(ii)    The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) in writing pursuant to a notice in the form of Exhibit B-5 of any prepayment hereunder (x) in the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, three (3) Business Days before the date of prepayment, (y) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, one (1) Business Day prior to the date of prepayment or (z) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment.  Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the Class or Classes of Loans to be repaid and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, a notice of prepayment delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or instruments of Indebtedness or other transaction, -39-in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02.  Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the notice of prepayment.  Prepayments pursuant to this Section 2.10(a) shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12 and shall be subject to Section 2.15.(b)    Mandatory Prepayments.  In the event and on such occasion that the aggregate Revolving Exposures exceed the lesser of (x) the aggregate Revolving Commitments and (y) the Availability Limit, the Borrower shall prepay Revolving Borrowings of such Class or, if applicable, Swingline Loans of such Class (or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit cash collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(j)) in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided that if any such excess shall result from a change in the applicable exchange rates, then such prepayment and/or cash collateralization shall only be required to be made by the Borrower upon one Business Day’s notice from the Administrative Agent.SECTION 2.11.    Fees. (a)    The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars for the account of each Lender a facility fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily amount of the Revolving Commitment of such Lender (or, if the Revolving Commitment of such Lender has terminated, on the average daily amount of the Revolving Exposure of such Lender) during the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date on which such Revolving Commitment terminates and such Lender’s Revolving Exposure has been reduced to zero.  Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate and the Revolving Exposure is reduced to zero, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Closing Date. All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).(b)    The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent in Dollars for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender’s LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements with respect to Letters of Credit following the date of the applicable LC Disbursement) during the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender’s Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting fee in Dollars, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, as well as such Issuing Bank’s standard fees and commissions with respect to the issuance, amendment, cancellation, negotiation, transfer, presentment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder.  Unless otherwise specified above, participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third (3rd) Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Closing Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which such Revolving Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments -40-terminate shall be payable on demand.  Any other fees payable to an Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within ten (10) days after demand.  All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  In addition to the foregoing fees and to the extent required to be paid under Section 9.03(a), the Borrower shall pay or reimburse the Issuing Bank for such normal and customary costs and expenses as are incurred or charged by the Issuing Bank in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit.(c)    All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in Dollars and immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the relevant Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders.  Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.SECTION 2.12.    Interest. (a)    The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Rate.(b)    The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.(c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2.00% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2.00% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.12.(d)    Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in Dollars in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans of any Class, upon termination of the Revolving Commitments of such Class; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period or a Swingline Loan), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.(e)    All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.-41-SECTION 2.13.    Alternate Rate of Interest.  If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in any currency:(a)    the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate, LIBO Rate for such Interest Period or currency; or(b)    the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate, LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy or transmission by electronic communication in accordance with Section 9.01(b) as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing denominated in such currency to, or continuation of any Borrowing denominated in such currency as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, and any Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in such currency that is requested to be continued shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent (i) determines that the circumstances described in clause (a) of this Section 2.13 have arisen and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary, (ii) determines that the circumstances described in clause (a) of this Section 2.13 have not arisen but the supervisor for the administrator of the Eurodollar Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the Eurodollar Rate shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, (iii) is advised by the Required Lenders of their determination in accordance with clause (b) of this Section 2.13, or (iv) new syndicated loans have started to adopt a new benchmark interest rate, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall endeavor to establish an alternate rate of interest to the Eurodollar Rate that gives due consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for comparable syndicated loans in the United States at such time, and shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate method of determining a rate of interest and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be applicable, provided that to the extent that the Administrative Agent determines that adoption of any portion of such market convention is not administratively feasible or that no market convention for the administration of such alternate rate of interest exists, the Administrative Agent shall administer such alternate rate of interest in a manner reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Borrower.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 9.02, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five (5) Business Days of the date notice of such alternate rate of interest is provided to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.  If a notice of an alternate rate of interest has been given and no such alternate rate of interest has been determined, and the circumstances under clause (i) above exist, the specific date referred to in clause (ii) has occurred or the Administrative Agent has received the notice from the Required Lenders referred to in clause (iii) above (as applicable), Alternate Base Rate shall apply without regard to clause (c) of the definition thereof.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if such alternate rate of interest shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement.-42-SECTION 2.14.    Increased Costs. (a)    If any Change in Law shall:(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or(ii)    impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition or Tax affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein or on its other loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto (other than any Excluded Taxes or any Indemnified Taxes, which are governed solely by Section 2.16);and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any Loan to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder, whether of principal, interest or otherwise, in each case by an amount material in the context of its making of, and participation in, extensions of credit under this Agreement, then, upon the request of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.(b)    If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines in good faith that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, upon the request of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.(c)    A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.(d)    Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or -43-reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.(e)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender or Issuing Bank shall be entitled to seek compensation under this Section 2.14 based on the occurrence of a Change in Law arising solely from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or any requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith, unless such Lender or Issuing Bank is generally seeking compensation from other borrowers with respect to its similarly affected commitments, loans and/or participations under agreements with such borrowers having provisions similar to this Section 2.14.SECTION 2.15.    Break Funding Payments.  In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or as a result of any prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.10 and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, such Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense (excluding loss of anticipated profit) attributable to such event in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan (and excluding any Applicable Rate), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the relevant currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurocurrency market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.SECTION 2.16.    Taxes.(a)    Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes unless otherwise required by applicable law. If any Loan Party or other applicable withholding agent shall be required by applicable Law to deduct or withhold any Taxes from any such payments (as determined in the good faith discretion of the applicable withholding agent), then (i) the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions or withholdings and timely pay any such Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, and (ii) if the Tax in question is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after all required deductions or withholdings for Indemnified Taxes (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.16) have been made, the Lender (or, in the case of a payment to the Administrative Agent for its own account, the Administrative Agent) receives on the due date a net sum equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.-44-(b)    In addition, without duplication of Section 2.16(a) the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes, other than Excluded Taxes, to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.(c)    The Loan Parties shall, jointly and severally, indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent (each a “Tax Indemnitee”), within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes, payable by such Tax Indemnitee (including Indemnified Taxes imposed on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.16) other than any penalties arising as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Lender or Agent (as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction), and any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the applicable Governmental Authority; provided, however, that if the Lender or Administrative Agent does not notify the Borrower of any indemnification claim under this Section 2.16 within 180 days after such Lender or Administrative Agent has received notice of the specific assessment or deficiency giving rise to such indemnification claim, the Loan Parties shall not be required to indemnify such Lender or Administrative Agent for any incremental interest or penalties resulting from such Lender’s or Administrative Agent’s failure to notify the Loan Parties within the 180 day period.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability prepared in good faith and delivered by the Tax Indemnitee or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of another Tax Indemnitee, accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(d)    Upon request by Administrative Agent after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, and in any event within 30 days of any such request, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.(e)    Each Lender shall, at such times as are reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with any documentation prescribed by Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent certifying as to any entitlement of such Lender to an exemption from, or reduction in, any withholding Tax with respect to any payments to be made to such Lender under any Loan Document.  In addition, each Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Each such Lender shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders any of the foregoing documentation (including any specific documentation required below in this Section 2.16(e)) obsolete, expired or inaccurate in any material respect, deliver promptly to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal ineligibility to do so.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.16(e), if the requested documentation is not required by Law, then the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(4) of this Section) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.-45-Without limiting the foregoing:(1)    Each Lender that is not a Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement two properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding.(2)    Each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) whichever of the following is applicable:(A)    two properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or any successor forms) claiming eligibility for the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, and such other documentation as required under the Code,(B)    two properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor forms),(C)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) two properly completed and duly signed certificates substantially in the form of Exhibit D-1, D-2, D-3 and D-4, as applicable, (any such certificate, a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) two properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or any successor forms),(D)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example, where the Foreign Lender is a partnership or a participating Lender), two properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms) of the Foreign Lender, accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9, Form W-8IMY or any other required information (or any successor forms) from each beneficial owner that would be required under this Section 2.16(e) if such beneficial owner were a Lender, as applicable (provided that, if the Foreign Lender is a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and not a participating Lender) and one or more beneficial owners are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, the U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate may be provided by such Foreign Lender on behalf of such beneficial owner(s)), or(E)    two properly completed and duly signed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable U.S. federal income tax laws as a basis for claiming a complete exemption from, or a reduction in, U.S. federal withholding tax on any payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents.(3)    Each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) two properly completed and duly signed copies of an applicable IRS Form W-8 (or any successor form) certifying such Foreign Lender’s non-U.S. status.-46-(4)    If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of those Sections (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by applicable Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for such Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, to determine whether such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender’s obligations under such Sections and, if necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (4), Section 1471 through 1474 of the Code shall include any amendments made to such sections after the date of this Agreement and any intergovernmental agreement (and any related Laws, regulations or official administrative practices) implementing the foregoing.Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause (e), a Lender shall not be required to deliver any documentation that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Loan Parties and to any successor Administrative Agent any documentation provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.16(e).(f)    If the Administrative Agent or a Lender receives a refund of any Indemnified Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts or indemnification payments pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall promptly pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the applicable Loan Parties under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender (including any Taxes) and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the Administrative Agent or a Lender be required to pay any amount to a Loan Party pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent or a Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent or a Lender would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.(g)    For the avoidance of doubt, the term “Lender,” for purposes of this Section 2.16, shall include any Swingline Lender and any Issuing Bank.(h)    The Administrative Agent and each Lender shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower in attempting to recover any Indemnified Taxes that the Borrower reasonably asserts were improperly imposed; provided, however, that any such attempts shall be at the sole cost of the Borrower and the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for any costs it incurs in connection with complying with this Section 2.16(h).  The Borrower shall have the right to dispute or -47-challenge in a reasonable manner and only to the extent necessary to protect its rights under applicable law, and at its sole cost and expense, the imposition of Indemnified Taxes with the relevant Governmental Authority.  In no event will this Section 2.16(h) relieve the Borrower of its obligation to pay additional amounts or indemnification payments to the Administrative Agent or any Lender under this Section 2.16.  Any refund obtained shall be repaid to the Borrower to the extent provided in Section 2.16(f).(i)    On or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement, any Administrative Agent that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower two duly completed copies of IRS Form W-9, or any subsequent versions or successors to such form, certifying that such Administrative Agent is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding. Any Administrative Agent, and any successor or supplemental Administrative Agent, that is not a U.S. Person, shall deliver to the Borrower (A) two duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY certifying that, with respect to payments received by it (on behalf of the Lenders) from the Borrower, it is a “U.S. branch”, the payments are not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and it is using such form as evidence of its agreement with the Borrower to be treated as a U.S. Person with respect to such payments and (B) with respect to payments received for its own account, two duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.16(i), no Administrative Agent shall be required to provide any documentation it is legally ineligible to provide as a result of a Change in Law after the date hereof.SECTION 2.17.    Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs.(a)    The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices referred to in Section 9.01 (or as otherwise directed by the Administrative Agent), except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and (x), in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension and (y) in the case of any payment of fees, such fees shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments under each Loan Document of principal or interest in respect of any Loan (or of any breakage indemnity in respect of any Loan) shall be made in Dollars, and, except as otherwise expressly set forth in any Loan Document, all other payments under each Loan Document shall be made in Dollars.(b)    If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, required cash collateral, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements and cash collateral then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements and cash collateral then due to such parties.-48-(c)    If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.(d)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the relevant Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the relevant Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.(e)    If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b), 2.17(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.SECTION 2.18.    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.(a)    If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.  Any Lender claiming reimbursement of -49-such costs and expenses shall deliver to the Borrower a certificate setting forth such costs and expenses in reasonable detail which shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(b)    If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, or any Lender is unable to fund its portion of any Loan as a result of any applicable law or regulation prohibiting, or any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority enjoining, prohibiting or restraining, any Lender from making any Loan requested by the Borrower or any Issuing Bank or any Lender from issuing, renewing, extending or increasing the face amount of or participating in the Letter of Credit requested to be issued, renewed, extended or increased by the Borrower or if any Lender (a “Non-Consenting Lender”) fails to grant a consent (x) in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by Section 9.02 for which the consent of each Lender or each affected Lender is required but the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained or (y) to extend Loans or Commitments pursuant to Section 2.20, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, to the extent required by Section 9.04, and (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest) or the Borrower (in the case of all fees and other amounts).SECTION 2.19.    Expansion Option.(a)    The Borrower may from time to time after the Closing Date elect to increase the Revolving Commitments or any Extended Revolving Commitments (“Increased Commitments”) in an aggregate principal amount of not less than $10,000,000 (or such lesser amount as may be reasonably agreed by the Administrative Agent) so long as, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of all such Increased Commitments established following the Closing Date does not exceed $150,000,000 (the “Incremental Basket Amount”).  The Borrower may arrange for any such increase to be provided by one or more Lenders (each Lender so agreeing to an increase in its Revolving Commitment or Extended Revolving Commitment in its sole discretion, an “Increasing Lender”), or by one or more new banks, financial institutions or other entities (each such new bank, financial institution or other entity, an “Augmenting Lender”), to increase their existing Revolving Commitment or Extended Revolving Commitment, as the case may be; provided that each Augmenting Lender (and, in the case of an Increased Commitment, each Increasing Lender) shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and, in the case of an Increased Commitment, each Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld).  Without the consent of any Lenders other than the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended pursuant to an Additional Credit Extension Amendment as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.19.  Increases and new Revolving Commitments created pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall become effective on the date agreed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender thereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Revolving Commitments or Extended Revolving Commitments shall be permitted under this paragraph unless on the proposed date of the effectiveness of such increase in the Revolving Commitments or Extended Revolving Commitments, (w) the representations and warranties of the Loan Parties -50-set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of the effectiveness of such increase (except where any representation and warranty is expressly made as of a specific earlier date, such representation and warranty shall be true in all material respects as of any such earlier date; provided that during any Collateral/Covenant Suspension Period the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.04(b) and 3.06 shall not be required to be made), (x) at the time of and immediately after giving effect to such increase, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (y) the Borrower shall be in compliance on a Pro Forma Basis with Section 6.09 as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b), assuming, for purposes of this clause (y) that the full amount of any such Increased Commitments has been drawn, whether or not so drawn and (z) the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate certifying as to compliance with the foregoing clause (w), (x) and (y), dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower. On the effective date of any increase in the Revolving Commitments or Extended Revolving Commitments, (i) each relevant Increasing Lender and Augmenting Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the Administrative Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other Lenders, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such increase and the use of such amounts to make payments to such other Lenders, each Lender’s portion of the outstanding Loans of all the Lenders to equal its Applicable Percentage of such outstanding Loans, and (ii) if, on the date of such increase, there are any Revolving Loans outstanding, such Revolving Loans shall on or prior to the effectiveness of such Increased Commitments be prepaid to the extent necessary from the proceeds of additional Revolving Loans made hereunder by the Increasing Lenders and Augmenting Lenders, so that, after giving effect to such prepayments and any borrowings on such date of all or any portion of such Increased Commitments, the principal balance of all outstanding Revolving Loans owing to each Lender with a Revolving Commitment is equal to such Lender’s pro rata share (after giving effect to any nonratable Increased Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.19) of all then outstanding Revolving Loans.  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the borrowing notice, minimum borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.  The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and, in respect of each Eurocurrency Loan, shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.15 if the deemed payment occurs other than on the last day of the related Interest Periods.  Any Increased Commitments shall be on the exact same terms as the Revolving Commitments being increased thereby.  (b)    This Section 2.19 shall override any provisions in Section 9.02 to the contrary.(c)    If, on the effective date of any Increased Commitments, there are any Revolving Loans of the applicable Class outstanding, such Revolving Loans shall on or prior to the effectiveness of such Increased Commitments be prepaid to the extent necessary from the proceeds of additional Revolving Loans made hereunder by the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders, so that, after giving effect to such prepayments and any borrowings on such date of all or any portion of such Increased Commitments, the principal balance of all outstanding Revolving Loans owing to each Lender with a Revolving Commitment of such Class is equal to such Lender’s pro rata share of all then outstanding Revolving Loans. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the borrowing notice, minimum borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and the deemed payments made pursuant the immediately preceding sentence shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and, in respect of each Eurocurrency Loan, shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.15 if the deemed payment occurs other than on the last day of the related Interest Periods. -51-SECTION 2.20.    Extended Revolving Commitments. (a)    The Borrower may, with the consent of each Person providing an Extended Revolving Commitment, the Administrative Agent and any Person acting as swingline lender or issuing bank under such Extended Revolving Commitments, amend this Agreement pursuant to an Additional Credit Extension Amendment to provide for Extended Revolving Commitments and to incorporate the terms of such Extended Revolving Commitments into this Agreement on substantially the same basis as provided with respect to the Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) the establishment of any such Extended Revolving Commitments shall be accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the Revolving Commitments and (ii) any reduction in the Revolving Commitments may, at the option of the Borrower, be directed to a disproportional reduction of the Revolving Commitments of any Lender providing an Extended Revolving Commitment.  No Lender shall have any obligation to agree to have any of its Revolving Loans of any Class converted into Extended Revolving Commitments.(b)    Any Extended Revolving Commitments shall be established pursuant to an Additional Credit Extension Amendment to this Agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender providing an Extended Revolving Commitment which shall be consistent with the provisions set forth above (but which shall not require the consent of any other Lender other than those consents provided pursuant to this Agreement).  Each Additional Credit Extension Amendment shall be binding on the Lenders, the Loan Parties and the other parties hereto.  In connection with any Additional Credit Extension Amendment, the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent shall enter into such amendments to the Collateral Documents as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent (which shall not require any consent from any Lender other than those consents provided pursuant to this Agreement) in order to ensure that the Extended Revolving Commitments are provided with the benefit of the applicable Collateral Documents and shall deliver such other documents, certificates and opinions of counsel in connection therewith as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent.(c)    The provisions of this Section 2.20 shall override any provision of Section 9.02 to the contrary.SECTION 2.21.    Judgment Currency.  If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower hereunder in one currency into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first currency could be purchased by the Administrative Agent with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final, non-appealable judgment is given.  The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the “Applicable Creditor”) shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder (the “Agreement Currency”), be discharged, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the Agreement Currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 2.17, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower.-52-SECTION 2.22.    Defaulting Lenders.(a)    Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:(i)    fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a);(ii)    the Revolving Commitment and Revolving Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); provided that this clause (ii) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby;(iii)    if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:(1)    so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing as to which the Administrative Agent has received written notice from the Borrower or a Lender at the time of any such reallocation, all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (disregarding for this purpose the Revolving Commitments of any Defaulting Lenders for all purposes of such calculation) but only to the extent that (i) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender’s Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Commitments and (ii) the sum of any individual non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Exposure plus such non-Defaulting Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such Defaulting Lender’s Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of such non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Commitments;(2)    if the reallocation described in clause (1) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Bank only the Borrower’s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (1) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;(3)    if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to clause (2) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is cash collateralized;-53-(4)    if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (1) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and Section 2.11(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders’ Applicable Percentages; and(5)    if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (1) or (2) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and(iv)    so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender’s then outstanding LC Exposure under such Revolving Facility will be 100% covered by the Revolving Commitments under such Revolving Facility of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.22(a)(iii), and participating interests in any newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.22(a)(iii)(1) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).(b)    If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a parent entity of any Lender shall occur following the Closing Date and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender, reasonably satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder after taking into account the terms of Section 2.22(a)(iii)(1).(c)    In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s Revolving Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans and participations in then outstanding Letters of Credit of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold Revolving Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage and shall reimburse each such other Lender for any costs of the type described in Section 2.15 incurred by any such other Lender as a result of such purchase (whereupon such Lender shall cease to be a Defaulting Lender).(d)    Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties hereto, each such party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender or Agent that is an EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, -54-may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:(i)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any Lender or Agent that is an EEA Financial Institution; and(ii)    the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:(A)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;(B)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or(C)    the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.ARTICLE III      Representations and WarrantiesThe Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders as of the Closing Date and (except as to representations and warranties made as of a certain date) as of the date such representations and warranties are deemed to be made under Section 4.02 of this Agreement that:SECTION 3.01.    Organization; Powers; Subsidiaries.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon any Loan Party or any other Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, or consent to the use by the Loan Party of any cash collateral arising in respect of the Collateral on such terms as the Administrative Agent deems reasonable, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign give an option or options to purchase or otherwise dispose of and deliver, or acquire by credit bid on behalf of the Secured Parties, the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker’s board or office of the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party or elsewhere, upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery, all without assumption of any credit risk.

If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other disposition.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this paragraph and the provisions of any Collateral Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Cash Management Obligations or Obligations arising under Secured Hedge Agreements except to the extent expressly provided herein and unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be.ARTICLE VIII      The Administrative Agent(a)    Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and the other Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.(b)    The Administrative Agent shall also act as the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential Hedge Bank and a potential Cash Management Bank) and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender and such Issuing Bank for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as “collateral agent” and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant hereto for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article VIII and Article IX (including Section 9.03, as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.(c)    The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any -80-kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.(d)    To the extent required by any applicable laws, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 2.16, each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, within 10 days after written demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold any Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective).  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this clause (d).  The agreements in this clause (d) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.  The term “Lender” shall, for purposes of this clause (d), include any Issuing Bank and any Swingline Lender.(e)    The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided herein), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided herein) or in the absence of its own bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the Collateral Documents or the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. (f)    The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, -81-and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.(g)    The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.(h)    Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign upon thirty (30) days’ notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower and (unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing) with the consent of the Borrower (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent from among the Lenders which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.(i)    Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.(j)    The Lenders irrevocably agree:(i)    that any Lien on any Property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document shall be automatically released (A) upon termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than (x) obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements, (y) Cash Management Obligations and (z) contingent reimbursement and indemnification obligations not yet accrued and payable) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit (other than Letters of Credit that have been cash collateralized in a manner reasonably acceptable to the applicable Issuing Banks), (B) at the time the Property subject to such Lien is transferred or to be transferred as part of -82-or in connection with any transfer permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document to any Person (other than in the case of a transfer by a Loan Party, any transfer to another Loan Party), (C) subject to Section 9.02, if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be required pursuant to Section 9.02) or (D) if the Property subject to such Lien is owned by a Guarantor, upon release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guarantee under the applicable Guaranty pursuant to clause (iii) below;(ii)    (A) to release or subordinate any Lien on any Property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 6.02(e) and (B) that the Administrative Agent is authorized (but not required) to release or subordinate any Lien on any Property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such Property that is permitted by any other clause of Section 6.02; (iii)    that any Guarantor (other than the Borrower) shall be automatically released from its obligations under the applicable Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Borrower pursuant to a transaction permitted hereunder or to the extent set forth in Section 5.11; and(iv)    Guarantors shall be released from their respective obligations under the Guaranty and Liens on Property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under the Collateral Documents shall be released, in each case in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.10. Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be required pursuant to Section 9.02) will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent’s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of Property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the applicable Guaranty and Collateral Documents pursuant to this paragraph (j).  In each case as specified in this paragraph (j), the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrower’s expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release or subordination of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents, or to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the applicable Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this paragraph (j). (k)    None of the Persons identified in this Agreement as an “arranger” or “bookrunner,” shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than, if applicable, those applicable to all Lenders as such.  Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender.  Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to the relevant Persons in their respective capacities as an Arranger as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in paragraph (i) of this Article VIII.(l)    Credit Bidding.  The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is subject, or (b) at any other sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law.  In connection with any such -83-credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) for the asset or assets so purchased (or for the equity interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are issued in connection with such purchase).  In connection with any such bid (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles (ii) each of the Secured Parties’ ratable interests in the Obligations which were credit bid shall be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to be assigned to such vehicle or vehicles for the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by, and the governing documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Required Lenders or their permitted assignees under the terms of this Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the case may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in Section 9.02 of this Agreement), (iv) the Administrative Agent on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue to each of the Secured Parties, ratably on account of the relevant Obligations which were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership, limited partnership interests or membership interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and/or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of Obligations credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Secured Parties pro rata and the equity interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of such Obligations shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action.  Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Obligations of each Secured Party are deemed assigned to the acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured Party shall execute such documents and provide such information regarding the Secured Party (and/or any designee of the Secured Party which will receive interests in or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, the formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such credit bid.ARTICLE IX     MiscellaneousSECTION 9.01.    Notices.(a)    Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone or other electronic communications (and subject to paragraph (b) below), all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by electronic communication, as follows:(i)    if to the Borrower, to;-84-Casey’s General Stores, Inc.

The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.(b)    Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document (with respect to such Loan Document), neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender or any Issuing Bank without the written consent of each Lender and Issuing Bank directly and adversely affected thereby, it being understood that a waiver of any condition precedent set forth in Section 4.01 or Section 4.02 or the waiver of any Default or mandatory prepayment shall not constitute an increase of any Commitment of any Lender, but that any waiver of any condition set forth in Section 4.02 following the Closing Date shall require the consent of the Required Lenders, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest or premium thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender and Issuing Bank directly and adversely affected thereby, it being understood that any change to the definition of “Consolidated Leverage Ratio” or in the component definitions thereof shall not constitute a reduction in the rate; provided that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to amend Section 2.12(c) or to waive any obligation of the Borrower to pay interest at the rate set forth therein, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender and Issuing Bank directly and adversely affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.17(b) or (c), or the provisions of Article VII, in each case, with respect to the pro rata application of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each adversely affected Lender and each adversely affected Issuing Bank, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of “Required Lenders” or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any -86-rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, (vi) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the applicable Guaranty and Collateral Documents without the written consent of each Lender (except in a transaction permitted hereunder); provided that during a Collateral/Covenant Suspension Period, (x) the Administrative Agent may release all or substantially all of the Guarantors (other than the Borrower), without the consent of any Lender and (y) the Required Lenders may waive or amend any requirement to reinstate the guarantee obligations of released Guarantors in the future, (vii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Lien of the Collateral Documents, without the written consent of each Lender; provided that during a Collateral/Covenant Suspension Period, (x) the Administrative Agent may release all or substantially all of the Collateral from any Lien granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under the Collateral Documents, without the consent of any Lender and (y) the Required Lenders may waive or amend any requirement to reinstate Collateral in the future or (viii) change the currency of any Loan or Letter of Credit, without the written consent of each Lender and Issuing Bank directly affected thereby; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights, obligations or duties of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the relevant Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be.Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (i) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Revolving Exposures and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (ii) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders.In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders providing the Replacement Revolving Loans (as defined below) to permit the refinancing of all outstanding Revolving Loans of any Class (“Refinanced Revolving Loans”) with a replacement revolving loan tranche (“Replacement Revolving Loans”) hereunder; provided that (a) the aggregate principal amount of such Replacement Revolving Loans shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of such Refinanced Revolving Loans except by an amount equal to unpaid accrued interest and premium thereon plus other reasonable amounts paid, and fees and expenses reasonably incurred, in connection with such refinancing, (b) the maturity date of any Replacement Revolving Loans shall be no earlier than the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and such Replacement Revolving Loans shall require no scheduled amortization or mandatory commitment reduction prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, and (c) all other terms applicable to such Replacement Revolving Loans (other than pricing, interest rate margins, rate floors, discounts, premiums, fees, and optional prepayment or optional redemption terms and provisions, all of which shall be determined by the Borrower) shall be substantially identical to, or less favorable to the Lenders providing such Replacement Revolving Loans than, those applicable to such Refinanced Revolving Loans, except to the extent necessary to provide for covenants and other terms applicable to any period after the latest final maturity of the Revolving Loans in effect immediately prior to such refinancing or added to this Agreement for the benefit of the Lenders hereunder (it being understood that no consent shall be required by Lenders for terms or conditions that are more restrictive than this Agreement if such terms or conditions are added to this Agreement).  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.02 to the contrary, (a) modifications to the Loan Documents may be made with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to the extent necessary or appropriate (i) to integrate any Increased Commitments or any Extended Revolving Commitments; provided that, without limitation of the foregoing, any such amendment may, (x) increase the interest rates, fees and -87-other amounts payable to any Class or Classes of Loans or Commitments hereunder, (y) increase, expand and/or extend any “most favored nation” provisions benefiting any Class or Classes of Loans or Commitments hereunder and (z) modify any other provision hereunder or under any other Loan Document in connection with the implementation of any Indebtedness permitted hereunder, where the terms of any such Indebtedness are more favorable to the lenders or holders thereof than the corresponding terms applicable to Loans and Commitments then existing hereunder and (ii) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency and (b) without the consent of any Lender or any Issuing Bank, the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent or any collateral agent may (in their respective sole discretion, or shall, to the extent required by any Loan Document) enter into any amendment, modification or waiver of any Loan Document, or enter into any new agreement or instrument, to effect the granting, perfection, protection, expansion or enhancement of any security interest in any Collateral or additional property to become Collateral for the benefit of the Secured Parties or as required by local law to give effect to, or protect any security interest for benefit of the Secured Parties, in any property or so that the security interests therein comply with applicable law or this Agreement or in each case to otherwise enhance the rights or benefits of any Lender under any Loan Document.SECTION 9.03.    Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.(a)    The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Arranger and their respective Affiliates, limited, in the case of legal expenses, to the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of a single counsel for the Arranger and the Administrative Agent (and, if necessary, one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction and regulatory counsel), in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the relevant Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, limited, in the case of legal expenses, to the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of a single counsel (and, if necessary, one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction and regulatory counsel), in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.03(a) shall not apply to Taxes, except any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising from any non-Tax claim.(b)    The Borrower shall indemnify, on a joint and several basis, each Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related reasonable and documented out‑of‑pocket expenses, limited, in the case of legal expenses, to the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of a single counsel for the Indemnitees (and, if necessary, one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction and one additional counsel for each Indemnitee in the event of conflicts of interest), incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby and the syndication of the Revolving Commitments by the Arranger, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by any Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) -88-to the extent relating to or arising from any of the foregoing, any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (i) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment to have resulted from (x) the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) a material breach of the Loan Documents by such Indemnitee or (ii) except in the case of an Agent (in its capacity as such), arise from disputes solely among Indemnitees and do not relate to any conduct by the Borrower or any of its Affiliates.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.03(b) shall not apply to Taxes, except any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising from any non-Tax claim.(c)    To the extent that a Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the relevant Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender’s pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such.(d)    To the extent permitted by applicable law, no party hereto shall assert, and each other party hereby waives, any claim against any party, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof; provided that this sentence shall not limit the Borrower’s indemnification obligations set forth above to the extent the relevant special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages are included in any third party claim in connection with which the relevant Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder.  No Indemnitee referred to in paragraph (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby except to the extent resulting from its or its Related Parties’ gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.(e)    All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than fifteen (15) days after written demand therefor; provided, however, that an Indemnitee shall promptly refund any amount received under this Section 9.03 to the extent that there is a final judicial or arbitral determination that such Indemnitee was not entitled to indemnification rights with respect to such payment pursuant to the express terms of this Section 9.03.SECTION 9.04.    Successors and Assigns.(a)    The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) except as expressly permitted hereunder, no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by a Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations -89-hereunder except in accordance with this Section.  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.(b)    (i)    Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more Persons that is an Eligible Assignee (other than the Borrower, its Affiliates and natural persons) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:(A)    to the extent required by the definition of “Eligible Assignee,” the Borrower; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to an assignment unless it shall have objected thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received notice thereof; provided further that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for (i) an assignment of a Revolving Commitment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or (ii) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignment;(B)    to the extent required by the definition of “Eligible Assignee,” the Administrative Agent; and(C)    to the extent required by the definition of “Eligible Assignee,” the Issuing Banks and Swingline Lender.(ii)    Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:(A)    except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent;(B)    each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, provided that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans;(C)    the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; (D)    the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (x) an Administrative Questionnaire and (y) all documentation and other information that the Administrative Agent reasonably requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act; and-90-(E)    the assignee shall not be (i) the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (ii) a Defaulting Lender or (iii) a natural person.For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b) and the definition of “Eligible Assignee,” the term “Approved Fund” has the following meaning:“Approved Fund” means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.(iii)    Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment).  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.(iv)    The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount (and related interest amounts) of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.(v)    Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in clause (ii)(C) of this Section 9.04(b) and any written consent to such assignment required by this paragraph (b), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register; provided that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b), 2.17(d) or 9.03(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon.  No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.(c)    (i)    Any Lender may, without the consent of or notice to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities that would meet the requirements of an “Eligible Assignee” (other than with respect to any required consents -91-and other than any person that, at the time of such participation, is (I) a Defaulting Lender or (II) the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that directly affects such Participant.  Subject to paragraph (c)(iii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 (subject to the requirements and limitations of such Sections (it being agreed that any documentation required to be provided pursuant to Section 2.16(e) shall be provided solely to the participating Lender) and Section 2.18) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.16(c) as though it were a Lender.(ii)    Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and related interest amounts) of each participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that the relevant parties, acting reasonably and in good faith, determine that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  Unless otherwise required by the IRS, any disclosure required by the foregoing sentence shall be made by the relevant Lender directly and solely to the IRS.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of the participation in question for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.(iii)    A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent that (i) such entitlement to a greater payment results from a change in any Law after the sale of the participation takes place and (ii) the participating Lender notifies the Borrower of such participation no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after such Change in Law becomes effective.(iv)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or a central bank having jurisdiction over it, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.-92-(v)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Lender will assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, or sell participations in its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement, to any Person who is (i) listed on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List maintained by the U.S. Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and/or on any other similar list maintained by OFAC pursuant to any authorizing statute, executive order or regulation or (ii) either (A) included within the term “designated national” as defined in the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R.

The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof.SECTION 9.06.    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  Unless specifically noted to the contrary, delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or pdf shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.SECTION 9.08.    Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final and in whatever currency denominated) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any of -93-and all the Obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured.  The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.  Each Lender and its Affiliates agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.SECTION 9.09.    Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and except for termination or release of a Guarantor’s obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms of Section 4.12 (but without prejudice to Section 2.04), the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged, impaired or otherwise affected by, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of, (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent, any other Guaranteed Party or any other Person to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, any Loan Document or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement; (iii) the release of, or any impairment of any security held by the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party for the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations; (v) the failure to perfect any security interest in, or the release of, any security held by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party; (vi) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any Loan Party, the lack of legal existence of the Borrower or any other Guarantor or legal obligation to discharge any of the Guaranteed Obligations by the Borrower or any other Guarantor for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, in any insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Loan Party; (vii) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights that any Guarantor may have at any time against the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any other Guaranteed Party or any other Person, whether in connection with the Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any unrelated transaction; (viii) this Agreement having been determined (on whatsoever grounds) to be invalid, non-binding or unenforceable against any other Guarantor ab initio or at any time after the Closing Date or (ix) any other circumstance (including statute of limitations), any act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise operate as a defense to, or discharge of, the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other guarantor or surety as a matter of law or equity (in each case, other than the satisfaction of the Termination Conditions).  Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Agreement shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations under this Agreement subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States or any comparable provisions of any similar federal or state law.(b)    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and except for termination or release of a Guarantor’s obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms of Section 4.12 (but without prejudice to Section 2.04), each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower or any other Guarantor or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower or any other Guarantor, other than the satisfaction of the Termination Conditions.  The Administrative Agent and the other Guaranteed Parties may in accordance with the terms of the Loans Documents, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any other accommodation with the Borrower or any other Guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any Guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Termination Conditions have been satisfied.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable Law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Guarantor, as the case may be, or any security.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Guarantor waives any and all suretyship defenses.(c)    Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of this Agreement, the Administrative Agent, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such Persons that this Agreement and the Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Debtor Relief Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or similar foreign, federal or state law to the extent applicable to this Agreement and the Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Administrative Agent and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the Obligations of each Guarantor under this Agreement at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the Obligations of such Guarantor under this Agreement not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.(d)    Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct or indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Loan Documents and that the waivers set forth in this Agreement are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.(e)    Each Qualified ECP Grantor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Loan Party to honor all of its obligations under this Agreement in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Grantor shall only be liable under this Section 2.03(e) for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incu

ons under this Section 2.03(e), or otherwise under this Agreement, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).  The obligations of each Qualified ECP Grantor under this Section 2.03(e) shall remain in full force and effect until the Termination Conditions have been satisfied.  Each Qualified ECP Grantor intends that this Section 2.03(e) constitute, and this Section 2.03(e) shall be deemed to constitute, a “keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of each other Loan Party for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.Section 2.04    Reinstatement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the Guarantors agrees that (a) its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization (or any analogous proceeding in any jurisdiction) of the Borrower or any other Guarantor or otherwise and (b) the provisions of this Section 2.04 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.Section 2.05    Agreement To Pay; Subrogation.  In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Borrower or any other Guarantor to pay any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the applicable Guaranteed Parties in cash the amount of such unpaid Guaranteed Obligation.  Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subject to Article III.Section 2.06    Information.  Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower’s and each other Guarantor’s financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Administrative Agent or the other Guaranteed Parties will have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.Section 2.07    Representations and Warranties.  Each Guarantor hereby represents and warrants that this Agreement (i) has been duly executed and delivered by each Guarantor that is party hereto and (ii) constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor, enforceable against each Guarantor that is party hereto in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or law).ARTICLE III  Indemnity, Subrogation and Subordination.Upon payment by any Guarantor of any Guaranteed Obligations, all rights of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the payments that must be made in order for the Termination Conditions to be satisfied.  If any amount shall be paid to the Borrower or any other Guarantor in violation of the foregoing restrictions on account of (i) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii) any such indebtedness of the Borrower or any other Guarantor, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Subject to the foregoing, to the extent that any Guarantor shall, under this Agreement or the Credit Agreement as a joint and several obligor, repay any of the Guaranteed Obligations constituting Loans or other advances made to another Loan Party under the Credit Agreement (an “Accommodation Payment”), then the Guarantor making such Accommodation Payment shall be entitled to contribution and indemnification from, and be reimbursed by, each of the other Guarantors in an amount equal to a fraction of such Accommodation Payment, the numerator of which fraction is such other Guarantor’s Allocable Amount and the denominator of which is the sum of the Allocable Amounts of all of the Guarantors; provided that such rights of contribution and indemnification shall be subordinated to the prior payment of the payments

All communications and notices hereunder shall (except as  otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement.  All communications and notices hereunder to a Guarantor shall be given in care of the Borrower.Section 4.02    Waivers; Amendment.  (a)    No failure by any Guaranteed Party to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.  The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan Document, are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by Law.  No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 4.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any other Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on any Guaranteed Party in any case shall entitle any Guaranteed Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.(b)    Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement.Section 4.03    Administrative Agent’s Fees and Expenses; Indemnification.  (a)    Each Guarantor, jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent for its fees and expenses incurred hereunder to the extent provided in Section 9.03 of the Credit Agreement; provided that each reference therein to the “Borrower” shall be deemed for this purpose to also be a reference to each “Guarantor.”(b)    Any such amount payable as provided hereunder shall be additional Obligations guaranteed hereby. The provisions of this Section 4.03 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent. All amounts due under this Section 4.03 shall be payable within fifteen Business Days of written demand therefor.Section 4.04    Successors and Assigns.  Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party permitted under the Credit Agreement; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of any Guarantor or any Guaranteed Party that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective permitted successors and assigns.  Except in a transaction expressly permitted under the Credit Agreement, no Guarantor may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the written consent of the Administrative Agent.Section 4.05    Survival of Agreement.  All covenants, agreements, indemnities, representations and warranties made by the Guarantors in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Guaranteed Parties and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any Guaranteed Party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that any Guaranteed Party may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, and shall continue in full force and effect until this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 4.12 hereof, or with respect to any individual Guarantor until such Guarantor is otherwise released from its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof.Section 4.06    Counterparts; Effectiveness; Several Agreement.

In addition, the Administrative Agent may at any time during the continuance of an Event of Default enforce such Grantor’s rights against such Account Debtors and obligors of General Intangibles.(b)    Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Grantor shall remain liable under each of the Accounts and payments in respect of General Intangibles to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any agreement giving rise thereto.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability under any agreement giving rise to an Account or a payment in respect of a General Intangible by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party of any payment relating thereto, nor shall the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party be obligated in any manner to perform any obligation of any Grantor under or pursuant to any agreement giving rise to an Account or a payment in respect of a General Intangible, to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party thereunder to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts that may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.Section 5.3    Pledged Collateral(a)    During the continuance of an Event of Default, upon reasonable prior written notice by the Administrative Agent to the relevant Grantor or Grantors, (i) the Administrative Agent shall have the right to receive any Proceeds of the Pledged Collateral and make application thereof to the Obligations in the order set forth in the Credit Agreement and (ii) the Administrative Agent or its nominee may exercise (A) any voting, consent, corporate and other right pertaining to the Pledged Collateral at any meeting of shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be, of the relevant issuer or issuers of Pledged Collateral or otherwise and (B) any right of conversion, exchange and subscription and any other right, privilege or option pertaining to the Pledged Collateral as if it were the absolute owner thereof (including the right to exchange any of the Pledged Collateral upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other fundamental change in the corporate or equivalent structure of any issuer of Pledged Stock, the right to deposit and deliver any Pledged Collateral with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent may determine), all without liability except to account for property actually received by it; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to any Grantor to exercise any such right, privilege or option and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing.(b)    In order to permit the Administrative Agent to exercise the voting and other consensual rights that it may be entitled to exercise pursuant hereto and to receive all dividends and other distributions that it may be entitled to receive hereunder, (i) each Grantor shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to the Administrative Agent all such proxies, dividend payment orders and other instruments as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably request and (ii) without limiting the effect of clause (i) above, such Grantor hereby grants to the Administrative Agent an irrevocable proxy to vote all or any part of the Pledged Collateral and to exercise all other rights, powers, privileges and remedies to which a holder of the Pledged Collateral would be entitled (including giving or withholding written consents of shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be, calling special meetings of shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be, and voting at such meetings), which proxy shall be effective, automatically and without the necessity of any action (including any transfer of any Pledged Collateral on the record books of the issuer thereof) by any other person (including the issuer of such Pledged Collateral or any officer or agent thereof) during the continuance of an Event of Default and which proxy shall only terminate upon the termination of this Agreement.(c)    During the continuation of an Event of Default, each Grantor hereby expressly authorizes and instructs each issuer of any Pledged Collateral pledged hereunder by such Grantor to (i) comply with any instruction received by it from the Administrative Agent in writing that (A) states that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (B) is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or further instructions from such Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that such issuer shall be fully protected in so complying and (ii) unless otherwise expressly permitted hereby, pay any dividend or other payment with respect to the Pledged Collateral directly to the Administrative Agent.Section 5.4    Grant of Intellectual Property License.  For the purpose of enabling the Administrative Agent, during the continuance of an Event of Default, to exercise rights and remedies hereunder at such time as the Administrative Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, and for no other purpose, each Grantor hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free (and free of any other obligation of payment)  license to use, assign, license or sublicense any of the Intellectual Property now owned, licensed or hereafter acquired by such Grantor, wherever the same may be located.  Such license shall include access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer programs used for the compilation or printout hereof.Section 5.5     Registration RightsEach Grantor recognizes that the Administrative Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any Pledged Collateral by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or otherwise or may determine that a public sale is impracticable or not commercially reasonable and, accordingly, may resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers that shall be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof.  Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner.  The Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any Pledged Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if such issuer would agree to do so.Section 5.6    DeficiencyEach Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay the Secured Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorney employed by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to collect such deficiency.ARTICLE VI        THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTSection 6.1    Administrative Agent’s Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact(a)    Each Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of such Grantor or in its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any appropriate action and to execute any document or instrument that may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor hereby gives the Administrative Agent the power and right, on behalf of such Grantor, without notice to or assent by such Grantor, to do any of the following:(i)    in the name of such Grantor or its own name, or otherwise, take possession of and indorse and collect any check, draft, note, acceptance or other instrument for the payment of moneys due under any Account or General Intangible or with respect to any other Collateral and file any claim or take any other action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or otherwise deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of collecting any such moneys due under any Account or General Intangible or with respect to any other Collateral whenever payable;(ii)    in the case of any Intellectual Property, execute and deliver, and have recorded, any agreement, instrument, document or paper as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate to evidence the Administrative Agent’s security interest in such Intellectual Property and the goodwill and General Intangibles of such Grantor relating thereto or represented thereby;(iii)    pay or discharge taxes and Liens levied or placed on or threatened against the Collateral, effect any repair or pay any insurance called for by the terms of this Agreement (including all or any part of the premiums therefor and the costs thereof);(iv)    execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section 5.1 (Code and Other Remedies) or 5.5 (Registration Rights), any endorsement, assignment or other instrument of conveyance or transfer with respect to the Collateral;

All powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the security interests created hereby are released.Section 6.2    Duty of Administrative AgentThe Administrative Agent’s sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Administrative Agent deals with similar property for its own account.  None of the Administrative Agent, any other Secured Party nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to any Collateral.  The powers conferred on the Administrative Agent hereunder are solely to protect the Administrative Agent’s interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to exercise any such powers.  The Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.Section 6.3    Authorization of Financing StatementsEach Grantor authorizes the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, counsel and other representatives, at any time and from time to time, to file or record financing statements, amendments to financing statements, and other filing or recording documents or instruments with respect to the Collateral in such form and in such offices appropriate to perfect the security interests of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, and such financing statements and amendments may describe the Collateral covered thereby as “all personal property of the debtor” or words of similar effect.  Each Grantor hereby also authorizes the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, counsel and other representatives, at any time and from time to time, to file continuation statements with respect to previously filed financing statements.  A photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement shall be sufficient as a financing statement or other filing or recording document or instrument for filing or recording in any jurisdiction.  Each Grantor hereby further authorizes the Administrative Agent to make filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or United States Copyright Office (or any successor office or any similar office in any other country), including this Agreement, agreements in the forms of Annex 2, 3 or 4 hereto or other documents for the purpose of perfecting, confirming, continuing, enforcing or protecting the security interest granted by such Grantor hereunder.Section 6.4    Authority of Administrative AgentEach Grantor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the Administrative Agent and the Grantors, the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority.  Anything that, pursuant to this Agreement, must be delivered to or held by the Administrative Agent may be delivered to or held by its duly designated agent.  The Administrative Agent’s rights and privileges granted hereunder are subject to any Intercreditor Agreement to which it is a party from time to time.

No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.  No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party would otherwise have on any future occasion.  The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.Section 7.4    Successors and AssignsThis Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each Grantor and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and each other Secured Party and their successors and assigns; provided, however, that no Grantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.Section 7.5    CounterpartsThis Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including by telecopy or electronic mail), each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 to the conflict of law principles thereof to the extent that the application of the laws of another jurisdiction would be required thereby).

During any Collateral/Covenant Suspension Period, the Administrative Agent will, at the applicable Grantor’s expense, execute and deliver to such Grantor such documents as such Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination.  Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, during any Collateral/Covenant Suspension Period, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and each other Collateral Document, including all covenants and representations and warranties contained herein and therein, shall not apply to the Grantors.Section 7.12    ReinstatementEach Grantor further agrees that, if any payment made by any Loan Party or other Person and applied to the Obligations is at any time annulled, avoided, set aside, rescinded, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential or otherwise required to be refunded or repaid, or the proceeds of Collateral are required to be returned by any Secured Party to such Loan Party, its estate, trustee, receiver or any other party, including any Grantor, under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or repayment, any Lien or other Collateral securing such liability shall be and remain in full force and effect, as fully as if such payment had never been made or, if prior thereto the Lien granted hereby or other Collateral securing such liability hereunder shall have been released or terminated by virtue of such cancellation or surrender), such Lien or other Collateral shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect any Lien or other Collateral securing the obligations of any Grantor in respect of the amount of such payment.Section 7.13    Administrative AgentEach Grantor hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent shall be afforded all of the rights, immunities, indemnities and privileges afforded to the Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Article VIII of the Credit Agreement, in connection with the execution of this Agreement by the Administrative Agent and the performance of its obligations hereunder, all of which are incorporated herein by reference thereto.[SIGNATURE PAGES FOLLOW]IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the undersigned has caused this Pledge and Security Agreement to be duly executed and delivered as of the date first above written.CASEY’S GENERAL STORES, INC., a GrantorBy:___________________________________ Name:     Title:    ACKNOWLEDGED AND AGREED as of the date first above written:ROYAL BANK OF CANADA, as Administrative AgentBy:________________________________ Name:     Title:    ANNEX 1TOPLEDGE AND SECURITY AGREEMENTFORM OF JOINDER AGREEMENTThis JOINDER AGREEMENT, dated as of ___________ ___, 20___, is delivered pursuant to Section 7.10 (Additional Grantors) of the Pledge and Security Agreement, dated as of [_], by CASEY’S GENERAL STORES, INC., an Iowa corporation (the “Borrower”), and the other Grantors party thereto in favor of Royal Bank of Canada, as administrative agent for the Secured Parties referred to therein (the “Pledge and Security Agreement”).
