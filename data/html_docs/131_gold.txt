Maximum Facility Amount. No Advance shall exceed the Available Facility Amount calculated immediately prior to giving effect to such Advance but calculated including all Advances that are expected to be made to fund Warehouse Assets that have been
purchased but have not settled. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Advances. If and to the extent that there are multiple Lenders during the term of this
Agreement, the relative Commitments of each such Lender shall be set forth in the assignment and assumption agreement relating to the assignment of the applicable existing Lenders rights and obligations hereunder to the new Lender. In any
event, the Commitments of the Lenders shall be several and not joint, no Lender shall have any duty whatsoever to make an Advance on behalf of any other Lender and the Administrative Agent shall have no duty whatsoever to make any Advance on behalf
of any Lender.  Section 2.02. Advances and Borrowings. Each Advance shall be made as part of a Borrowing. Each Advance shall
be in an aggregate amount that is not less than $500,000. The Warehouse Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Borrower, shall direct whether an Advance made to the Borrower shall be used for the purchase of a Warehouse Asset directly by the Borrower
or a Designated Subsidiary.  Section 2.03. Requests for Borrowings; Authorization of Purchases and Equity Contributions.
(a) The Warehouse Collateral Manager, on behalf of a specified Borrower Party, shall, on or prior to the second Business Day preceding the proposed trade date of each proposed acquisition of Warehouse Assets (whether proposed to be funded by an
Advance or by the use of all or a portion of the Equity Contribution Amount) provide to the Administrative Agent (with a copy to the Lenders and the Borrower) a notice by electronic mail in the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto (together with any attachments required in connection therewith, an Approval Request), which notice (among other things shall indicate the Borrower Party for which the Warehouse
Asset is being purchased). Such approval may take the form of a standing list of pre-approved assets containing the characteristics of each pre-approved asset specified
in Exhibit A-1 (other than purchase price), together with a notice of intention to trade containing the par amount and purchase price of the Warehouse Asset(s) being acquired
delivered on or prior to the second Business Day preceding the proposed trade date. 
  -28- 




The Administrative Agent shall have the right to approve or reject any Approval Request in
its sole discretion and to request additional information regarding any proposed Warehouse Asset. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Warehouse Collateral Manager in writing (including via electronic mail) whether each Approval
Request has been approved or rejected. Any approval may be withdrawn at any time prior to the time at which the applicable Borrower Party actually becomes obligated to purchase or enter into documents governing such proposed Warehouse Asset by
written notice (including via e-mail) of such withdrawal from the Administrative Agent to the Warehouse Collateral Manager. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent may not withdraw any such
approval after the applicable Borrower Party has entered into an irrevocable commitment to acquire such proposed Warehouse Asset. If the Administrative Agent has rejected an Approval Request, or withdrawn or withheld its approval of any such
request, then the applicable Borrower Party shall not be authorized to purchase such proposed Warehouse Asset.  (b) On the date that any
Delayed Drawdown Debt Obligation or Revolving Obligation is acquired by a Borrower Party, the acquisition of which was approved by the Administrative Agent and the terms of which require additional payments to be made by the Borrower after the
acquisition thereof, amounts in the Custodial Account equal to the Unfunded Exposure Amount shall be deposited into the Reserve Account and designated for the purpose of funding such additional payments and shall not be available for the purchase of
any other Warehouse Assets; provided that, to the extent such amounts in the Custodial Account are not sufficient to cover the Unfunded Exposure Amount, the Borrower (on behalf of the applicable Borrower Party) shall request that the Lenders
make an Advance in the amount equal to the Unfunded Exposure Amount on the date that such Delayed Drawdown Debt Obligation or Revolving Obligation is acquired to be deposited into the Reserve Account (subject to the applicable dollar limitation set
forth in the definition of the term Maximum Facility Amount). Such amounts shall be designated for the purpose of funding such additional payments and shall not be available for the purchase of other Warehouse Assets. All amounts in the Reserve
Account will be invested in Eligible Investments at the direction of the Warehouse Collateral Manager (or the Administrative Agent if an Event of Default has occurred). In the event no such direction is received, the amounts in the Reserve Account
shall be invested in the U.S. Bank National Association Money Market Deposit Account. On the date that any additional payment is required to be made by a Borrower Party in connection with a Delayed Drawdown Debt Obligation or a Revolving
Obligation, amounts will be withdrawn from the Reserve Account without further consent of the Administrative Agent and applied to make such additional payment. In the event that any Delayed Drawdown Debt Obligation or Revolving Obligation is sold by
a Borrower Party or the amount of potential additional payments in respect of a Delayed Drawdown Debt Obligation or Revolving Obligation is irrevocably reduced, an amount equal to the amount of the applicable reduction in a Borrower Partys
potential additional payment obligations with respect to such Delayed Drawdown Debt Obligation or Revolving Obligation will be transferred from the Reserve Account to the Custodial Account and treated as a prepayment of the applicable Warehouse
Asset. 
  -29- 




(c) If the Warehouse Collateral Manager wishes to purchase a Warehouse Asset on behalf of a
Borrower Party for which the Approval Request has been approved pursuant to clause (a) above with an Advance (including an Advance to be applied to the purchase of a Warehouse Asset constituting a Delayed Drawdown Debt Obligation or a Revolving
Obligation and requiring the funding of such Advance to the Reserve Account pursuant to Section 2.03(b)), the Warehouse Collateral Manager on behalf of the applicable Borrower Party shall, prior to 10:00 a.m.,

of Exhibit A-2 hereto (together with any attachments required in connection therewith, a Borrowing Request) relating to such proposed purchase, which notice
shall indicate the Borrower Party for which the Warehouse Asset is being purchased. Each Borrowing Request shall include a statement with respect to each Warehouse Asset to which it relates indicating whether or not the seller of such Warehouse
Asset is the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates. The settlement of the purchase of a Warehouse Asset shall be made to the Borrower pursuant to customary loan settlement practices unless, if directed by the Warehouse Collateral Manager
with notice to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, the settlement of such purchase shall be made to a Designated Subsidiary. Any purchase by the Borrower of a Warehouse Asset from the Equityholder pursuant to the Sale Agreement that
the Borrower (or the Warehouse Collateral Manager on its behalf) intends to contribute to a Designated Subsidiary may, for administrative convenience, settle directly with such Designated Subsidiary but such Warehouse Asset shall be deemed to have
been purchased by the Borrower pursuant to the Sale Agreement and contributed to such Designated Subsidiary for purposes of this Agreement and the Sale Agreement. 
Section 2.04. Funding of Borrowings. Each Lender shall make each Advance to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof
by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 2:00 p.m., New York City time, to the Custodial Account of the Borrower (or the Reserve Account, as applicable). No Advances shall be made to a Borrower Party other than the Borrower
however, for the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower (or the Warehouse Collateral Manager on its behalf) may direct the use of the proceeds of any Advance for the purchase of Warehouse Assets by any Designated Subsidiary. 
Section 2.05. Termination of Commitment. The Commitment shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date. 
Section 2.06. Repayment of Obligations; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to repay the

  -30- 




(c) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
Section 2.06(b) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any
manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Credit Documents. 
Section 2.07. Prepayment of Advances. 
(a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay the principal amount of any Advance with the proceeds of
(x) Equity Contributions made pursuant to Section 2.09(b) or (y) a Variation Margin Posting Excess as set forth in Section 2.09(a)(ii), in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in
accordance with Section 2.07(b); provided, that, any principal amount to be prepaid hereunder shall be equal to or greater than $500,000 and Advances shall be prepaid in the manner set forth in Section 6.4 of
the Security Agreement. On any date on which an Advance is prepaid in accordance with the preceding sentence (each such date, a Prepayment Date), the Borrower shall, by applying solely Interest Proceeds it has received in respect
of the Pledged Assets prior to such Prepayment Date, pay first (A) any interest accrued in accordance with Section 2.08 in respect of the principal amount of any Advance being prepaid, second (B) any accrued and
unpaid Unused Fees and third (C) any accrued and unpaid Increased Costs.  (b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (with
a copy to the Collateral Agent) by electronic mail of each prepayment under this Section 2.07 not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three (3) Business Days before the related Prepayment Date. Each

(c) On the closing of a Permitted CLO, the Borrower shall prepay the Advances and interest accrued in accordance with
Section 2.08 in respect thereof in accordance with the Security Agreement.  (d) In addition, the Advances shall

by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, such overdue amount shall bear interest, at a rate per annum equal to 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Advance as provided in clause (a) above. 
(d) Accrued interest on each Advance shall be payable in arrears on each Payment Date for such Advance and, with respect to prepayments made in
accordance with Section 2.07, upon the date of such prepayment; provided, that, interest accrued pursuant to clause (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that a
Warehouse Asset is purchased with accrued interest, commitment fee or any other fees thereon, the Borrower shall nevertheless apply all amounts a Borrower Party receives in respect of interest, commitment fees and any other fees from such Warehouse
Asset in accordance with Article VI of the Security Agreement. 
  -31- 




(e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and the

respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without requiring any amendment to, or requiring any further action by or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or 
(ii) (A) a Benchmark Transition Event or, as the case may be, an Early Opt-in
Election and the Benchmark Replacement Date with respect thereto has already occurred prior to the Reference Time for any setting of the then-current Benchmark and as a result the then-current Benchmark is being determined in accordance with clauses (2), (3) or (4) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement; and (B) the Administrative Agent subsequently determines,
that (w) Term SOFR and a Benchmark Replacement Adjustment with respect thereto is or has becomes available and the Benchmark Replacement Date with respect thereto has occurred, (x) there is currently a market for U.S. dollar-denominated transactions utilizing Term SOFR as a Benchmark and for determining the Benchmark Replacement Adjustment with respect thereto, (y) Term SOFR is being recommended as the Benchmark
for U.S. dollar-denominated syndicated credit facilities by the Relevant Governmental Body and (z) in any event, Term SOFR, the Benchmark Replacement Adjustment with respect thereto and the

not later than the close of business (New York time) on the first Business Day after receipt of such request or direction or (z) in accordance with Section 2.09(b)(iii). 
(b) (i) In connection with (A) each Equity Contribution in accordance with clause (ii) below for the acquisition by the Borrower
of any Warehouse Asset in accordance with Section 2.03(a), (B) each Equity Contribution in accordance with Section 2.09(a)(iii), (C) each Equity Contribution deposited into the Custodial
Account for transfer to the Reserve Account and (D) each prepayment of an Advance in accordance with Section 2.07(a) (and, if applicable, Section 2.09(b)(iii) below), the Equityholder shall
make an Equity Contribution in an aggregate amount equal to (w) the portion of the purchase price of the Warehouse Asset to be acquired with the proceeds of Equity Contributions in the case of clause (A), (x) the amount of Equity
Contributions required to be purchased under Section 2.09(a)(iii) in the case of clause (B), (y) the Required Equity Funding Amount in the case of clause (C) and (z) the principal amount and interest
accrued thereon of the Advance to be prepaid with Equity Contributions in the case of clause (D). On the Business Day that the Collateral Agent receives Equity Contributions pursuant to this Section 2.09(b), the
Collateral Agent shall notify the Administrative Agent of the amount of such Equity Contribution.  (ii) At the written
request of the Warehouse Collateral Manager (which may be by email), the Equityholder hereby agrees, and shall be unconditionally obligated, no later than one Business Day prior to the date upon which any Warehouse Asset is expected to settle to
make an Equity Contribution as requested by the Warehouse Collateral Manager to settle such Warehouse Asset; provided that any such Equity Contribution shall be in an aggregate principal amount of no less than $25,000,000 unless a lower
amount is otherwise agreed to in writing (which may be by email) by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion. The Warehouse Collateral Manager shall give two Business Days prior notice (which may be by
e-mail) to the Equityholder of the amount of Equity Contribution required to be purchased pursuant to the preceding sentence. 
(iii) If the Designated Subsidiary Proceeds are insufficient to cause (a) the LTV Ratio to be equal to or lower than 80%
and (b) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances to be equal to or lower than the lesser of (x) $500,000,000 and (y) the then-current aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Equity Contributions multiplied by four
(4), the Equityholder hereby agrees, and shall be unconditionally obligated to make additional Equity Contributions on such date in an aggregate principal amount of at least the difference between (i) $25,000,000 and (ii) the Equity
Contribution 
  -34- 





Amount and sufficient, after application of the proceeds pursuant to the Security Agreement, to cause (a) the LTV Ratio to be equal to or lower than 80% and (b) the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Advances to be equal to or lower than the lesser of (x) $500,000,000 and (y) the then-current aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Equity Contributions multiplied by four (4). 
(iv) If following the closing of a Permitted CLO, the Equity Contribution Amount is less than $10,000,000, the Equityholder
hereby agrees, and shall be unconditionally obligated, to make Equity Contributions prior to the first date on which Warehouse Assets are settled following the closing date of such Permitted CLO, in an aggregate principal amount of at least the
difference between (i) $10,000,000 and (ii) the Equity Contribution Amount.  (c) Any Equity Contribution made pursuant to this
Section 2.09 may be in the form of the contribution of Warehouse Assets by the Equityholder to the Borrower. The value of any such contribution shall be the Market Value. For the avoidance of doubt, any Warehouse Asset that
is contributed by the Equityholder to the Borrower shall be subject to the terms of this Credit Agreement, including without limitation, the approval of the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.03. 
Section 2.10. Payments. 
(a) Any and all payments made by the Borrower under the Credit Documents shall be made in U.S. dollars. Each party hereto agrees that the
Available Amount and all such other amounts described in Article VI of the Security Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the priority of payments set forth in Article VI of the Security Agreement and otherwise in accordance with
the Credit Documents. The Lenders, the Equityholder and the Administrative Agent hereby instruct the Collateral Agent to apply the Available Amount and all such other amounts described in Article VI of the Security Agreement in accordance with
Article VI of the Security Agreement and otherwise in accordance with the Credit Documents.  Section 2.11. Increased Costs;
Capital Adequacy.  (a) If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, assessment, fee, tax, insurance charge, liquidity or
similar requirement (including any compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate,
participant, successor or assign thereof (each of which shall be an Affected Party);  (ii) impose on any
Affected Party or the London interbank market (or any other market material to the calculation of the Benchmark in the relevant date of determination) any other condition, cost or expense (other than Excluded Taxes and
Non-Excluded Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Advances or participation therein or the obligation or right of any Lender to make Advances hereunder; 
  -35- 




(iii) change the amount of capital maintained or required or requested or
directed to be maintained by any Affected Party; or  (iv) change the rate for, or the manner in which the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (or a successor thereto) assesses deposit insurance premiums or similar charges;  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to
increase the cost to or impose a cost upon such Affected Party of funding or making or maintaining any Advance or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Advance or otherwise performing its obligations under the Credit Documents or to
increase the cost to such Affected Party or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Affected Party, whether of principal, interest or otherwise or to require any payment calculated by reference to the amount of interest or
loans received or held by such Affected Party, then the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower (and the Warehouse Collateral Manager) prompt notice thereof and, so long as the condition remains in effect, the Borrower shall either pay the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Advances then outstanding (including by sale of assets or additional financing) or pay additional interest on the Advances at a rate per annum equal to the floating rate index which the Administrative
Agent reasonably determines to be generally applicable to secured financings and/or collateralized loan transactions on the relevant date of determination plus the spread over the Benchmark set forth in Section 2.08(a)
hereof.  (b) If any Affected Party determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on such Affected Partys capital or on the capital of Affected Partys holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Advances made by such Affected Party to a level below that
which such Affected Party or Affected Partys holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Affected Partys policies and the policies of such Affected Partys holding company with
respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Affected Party such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Affected Party or Affected Partys holding company for any such reduction
suffered.  (c) A certificate of an Affected Party providing an explanation of the applicable Change in Law and setting forth the amount or
amounts necessary to compensate such Affected Party or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in clause (a) or (b) of this Section 2.11 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. In determining any amount provided for in this Section 2.11, the Affected Party may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. The Borrower shall pay such Affected Party the amount shown as
due on any such certificate on the Payment Date following receipt thereof.  (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Affected Party to
demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall not constitute a waiver of any Affected Partys right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate any Affected
Party pursuant to this Section 2.11 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Affected Party notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Affected Partys intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is
retroactive, then the one hundred and eighty (180)-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
  -36- 




(e) In the event that any Affected Party shall incur any loss or expense (including any loss
or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Affected Party to make any purchase or loan or maintain any purchase or loan) as a result of any Advance not being made in accordance with a
request therefor under Section 2.03, then, on the Payment Date following written notice from such Affected Party to the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay to such Affected Party, the amount of such loss or expense. Such
written notice (which shall include calculations in reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower. 
Section 2.12. Taxes; AML Compliance. 
(a) Except as otherwise required by law or in connection with FATCA, all payments made by or on account of an obligation of the Borrower to the
Secured Parties under any Credit Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, deductions, withholdings (including backup
withholding), assessments, fees or other charges, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (Taxes).
If any such Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) by applicable law from any amounts payable hereunder, then (i) the Borrower or its agents shall make such
deduction or withholding, (ii) the Borrower or its agent shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority, and (iii) if such Taxes are Non-Excluded Taxes, then
the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any deduction or withholding on account of such Non-Excluded Taxes has been made (including such deductions and withholdings
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.12) the amount received by the applicable recipient equals an amount equal to the sum the recipient would have received had no such deduction or withholding for Non-Excluded Taxes been made. The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority all Borrower Tax Obligations. As promptly as practicable after the payment of any Taxes or Borrower Tax Obligation
by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.12, the Borrower shall furnish to the Lenders, the Equityholder and the Administrative Agent a copy of an official receipt (or a certified copy thereof) evidencing the payment of
such Taxes or Borrower Tax Obligation. The Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders and the Administrative Agent for any Non-Excluded Taxes (including Non-Excluded Taxes
imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.12) and any Borrower Tax Obligation levied, imposed or assessed on, or withheld or deducted from a payment to (and whether or not paid directly
by) the Lenders or the Administrative Agent and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Non-Excluded Taxes and Borrower Tax Obligation are correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority, promptly upon notice thereof by any Lender or the Administrative Agent. In addition, the Borrower shall, within ten (10) days after written demand by a Lender or the Administrative
Agent, indemnify the Lenders and Administrative Agent for any incremental taxes that may become payable by a Lender or the Administrative Agent as a result of any failure of the Borrower to pay any
Non-Excluded Taxes or Borrower Tax Obligations, when 
  -37- 





due to the appropriate Governmental Authority or to deliver to such Lender, Administrative Agent or Equityholder documentation evidencing the payment of the
Non-Excluded Taxes or Borrower Tax Obligations in accordance with this Section 2.12(a). A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The indemnity provided for herein shall survive the payment of all the
Borrowers obligations to the Lenders under the Credit Documents and termination of the Credit Documents.  (b) If a Lender receives a
refund in respect of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Borrower Tax Obligations as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 2.12, it shall within thirty (30) days from the date of such receipt pay over the amount of such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this
Section 2.12 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Lender and
without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of a Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus penalties, interest
or other charges) to that Lender in the event the Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.12(b), in no event will a Lender be
required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.12(b) the payment of which would place the applicable Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the
applicable Lender would have been in if the Tax subject to the indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had
never been paid. This Section 2.12(b) shall not be construed to require any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other
Person.  (c) If a Lender is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments made under this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, it shall deliver to the Borrower, at the time reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made
without withholding or at a reduced rate; provided that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would not subject such
Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Notwithstanding the above, (i) any Lender that is a United States person as defined under
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower, the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
reasonable request of the Borrower, the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax,
(ii) any Lender that is not a United States person as defined under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower, the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be
requested by the Borrower, the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower, the
Collateral Agent or the Administrative 
  -38- 





Agent), any of the following: (A) with respect to payments of interest under this Agreement or any other Credit Document, executed copies of IRS
Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding tax
pursuant to the interest article of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under this Agreement or any other Credit Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding tax
pursuant to the business profits or other income article of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party; (B) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI; or
(C) (x) a certificate to the effect that such person is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of
Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding tax (including any other applicable attachments), (iii) any Lender
that is not a United States person as defined under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall, at the request of the Borrower, the Collateral Agent or Administrative Agent, and to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to
the Borrower, the Collateral Agent or Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be reasonably requested by the Borrower, the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent) on or prior to the date on which such person becomes a Lender
under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower, the Collateral Agent or Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from
or reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower, the Collateral Agent or Administrative Agent to determine the
withholding or deduction required to be made, and (iv) each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall provide any information that is requested by the Borrower in connection with FATCA. 
(d) Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.12(a) with
respect to itself, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Advances affected by such event with the object of avoiding the
consequences of such event; provided that such designation is made on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided,
further, that nothing in this Section 2.12(d) shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a). The Borrower hereby
agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation.  (e) [Reserved]. 
(f) The Borrower intends to treat, and each Lender agree to treat, the Advances as debt of the Borrower, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and not to take any positions inconsistent with such positions unless otherwise required by law. 
  -39- 




(g) Each Lender and Equityholder agrees to provide each Designated Subsidiary (or its agent)
with the information and documentation that may be required for any Designated Subsidiary to achieve AML Compliance and agrees that such Designated Subsidiary (or its agents) may share such information with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority if
required by the Cayman AML Regulations.  Section 2.13. Increase in the Maximum Facility Amount. 
(a) Request for Increase. Provided there exists no Default, Event of Default or LTV Ratio Event, and subject to compliance with the
terms of this Section 2.13, upon notice to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, the Borrower may elect to request, at any time and from time to time prior to the Commitment Termination Date, to increase the amount set
forth in clause (x) of the definition of Maximum Facility Amount (each such increase, shall be referred to herein as a Facility Increase). 
(b) Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase. The following are conditions precedent to such increase: 
(i) The Borrower shall, not later than the tenth (10th) Business Day prior
to the Facility Increase Date (or such shorter period reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent), deliver to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a Facility Increase Request signed by the Borrower; 
(ii) The Facility Increase Request shall specify the date (the Facility Increase Date) on which the Borrower
proposes that the Facility Increase is effective and any increase to the Maximum Limit;  (iii) The Administrative Agent and
each Lender shall have consented to the Facility Increase and the Facility Increase Date in its sole discretion, and after each Lender has received all necessary internal approvals in connection with such Facility Increase; 
(iv) On or prior to the Facility Increase Date, the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent: (A) any upfront
fees as agreed upon by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and (B) all other fees due and owing hereunder or under any other Credit Document; and 
(v) The Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered any legal opinions or other customary closing documents reasonably

(a) If on any day a Warehouse Asset is (or becomes) a Warranty Breach Asset, no later than three (3) Business Days following the earlier
of knowledge by the Borrower of such Warehouse Asset becoming a Warranty Breach Asset or receipt by the Borrower from the Administrative Agent or the Warehouse Collateral Manager of written notice thereof, the Borrower shall either: 
  -40- 




(i) make a deposit to the Custodial Account (for allocation pursuant to the
Security Agreement) in immediately available funds in an amount equal to the sum of (x) (i) the actual price paid by the Borrower for such Warehouse Asset, multiplied by (ii) the Outstanding Balance of such Warehouse
Asset, plus (y) any accrued and unpaid interest on such Warehouse Asset (such price, the Repurchase Price); provided that the Administrative Agent shall have the right to determine whether the amount so
deposited is sufficient to satisfy the foregoing requirements; or  (ii) with the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, substitute for such Warranty Breach Asset a substitute Warehouse Asset (such Warehouse Asset, a Substitute Asset). 
(b) Upon confirmation of the deposit of the amounts set forth in Section 3.01(a)(i) into the Custodial Account or the
delivery by the Borrower of a Substitute Asset for each Warranty Breach Asset pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(ii) (the date of such confirmation or delivery, the Release Date), such Warranty Breach Asset
shall be removed from the Collateral and, as applicable, the Substitute Asset shall be included in the Collateral. On the Release Date of each Warranty Breach Asset, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, shall automatically
and without further action be deemed to release to the Borrower, without recourse, representation or warranty, all the right, title and interest and any Lien of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties in, to and under the
Warranty Breach Asset and all future monies due or to become due with respect thereto.  ARTICLE IV 
Representations and Warranties 
Section 4.01. Representations and Warranties of the Borrower. 
The Borrower, on behalf of itself and each other Borrower Party, represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the
Collateral Agent and the Equityholder, as of the date of this Agreement and the date of each Advance, that:  (a) Organization;
Powers. The Borrower is a limited liability company and each Designated Subsidiary is an exempted company, in each case, duly incorporated and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has the
full corporate power and authority to own its assets, to enter into the Credit Documents and to perform the Transactions.  (b)
Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required, stockholder action. The Credit Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower (and, if applicable, each
other Borrower Party) and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the applicable Borrower Party, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting
creditors rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. 
  -41-

any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation, in
each case, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (c) will not violate (x) in the case of the Borrower, the LLC Agreement and (y) in the case of any Designated Subsidiary, the memorandum and
articles of association or, in either case, any other organizational documents of any Borrower Party or any order of any Governmental Authority, (d) will not violate or result in a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument

the Lien on such assets created by the Security Agreement).  (d) Financial Condition. As of the date of this Agreement, each
Borrower Party has no existing material liabilities or contingent obligations except under the Credit Documents. No Borrower Party has issued stock or other equity interests other than its ordinary shares or membership interests, as applicable.
All of the Interests of the Borrower are held and beneficially owned by the Equityholder. Each Borrower Party has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in transactions of the types contemplated by this Agreement, and has not engaged in any
business activity other than the negotiation, execution and to the extent applicable, performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents and the Warehouse Collateral Management Agreement. 
(e) Litigation. No actions or proceedings at law or in equity are pending (or, to its knowledge, threatened) against it before any
court, tribunal, governmental body, agency or official or any arbitrator that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 
(f) Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each Borrower Party is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any Governmental

Material Adverse Effect.  (g) Investment Company Status. No Borrower Party is required to register as an investment
company under the Investment Company Act.  (h) Disclosure. Each Borrower Party has disclosed to the Administrative Agent all
agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which it is subject, and all other matters known to it, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No reports, financial

Borrower Party entered into an irrevocable commitment to purchase it, such Warehouse Asset satisfies the Eligibility Criteria and the Concentration Limits set forth in Exhibit B. 
(k) Valid Security Interest. With respect to each Warehouse Asset, as of the date on which a Borrower Party entered into an irrevocable
commitment to purchase it, the applicable governing documents do not prohibit the Granting and perfection of a first priority security interest in such Warehouse Asset. 
(l) Borrower Sophistication. The Warehouse Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Borrower Parties) is a sophisticated purchaser
with respect to interests in the Warehouse Assets and none of the Lenders nor the Administrative Agent have given any investment, legal or other advice or rendered any opinion as to whether the purchase of any Warehouse Asset is prudent, and no
Borrower Party is relying on any representation, warranty, investment, legal or other advice by any Lender or the Administrative Agent except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. 
(m) Withholding Tax Forms. Except with respect to any Warehouse Assets with respect to which the Borrower is entitled to a full gross-up from the obligor of such Warehouse Asset for any and all withholding taxes, the Borrower has completed and delivered, or the Warehouse Collateral Manager has completed and delivered on its behalf, to such
parties as are necessary, such forms as are required of it by the documents governing such Warehouse Assets, the taxing authorities of the United States or other jurisdictions, if applicable, to establish that no payment or distribution under any
documents governing such Warehouse Assets shall be subject to withholding taxes imposed by the taxing authorities of the United States or other jurisdictions, if applicable. If any Designated Subsidiary owns any Warehouse Asset, except with respect
to any Warehouse Assets with respect to which such Designated Subsidiary is entitled to a full gross-up from the obligor of such Warehouse Asset for any and all withholding taxes, such Designated Subsidiary
has completed and delivered, or the Warehouse Collateral Manager has completed and delivered on its behalf, to such parties as are necessary, such forms as are required of it by the documents governing such Warehouse Assets, the taxing authorities
of the United States or the Cayman Islands, or other jurisdictions, if applicable, to establish that no payment or distribution under any documents governing such Warehouse Assets shall be subject to withholding taxes imposed by the taxing
authorities of the United States or the Cayman Islands, or other jurisdictions, if applicable.  (n) No Fiduciary Duty. Each Borrower
Party acknowledges that none of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of a Lenders Affiliates shall have any fiduciary duty, duty of loyalty, duty of care, duty of disclosure or other obligation whatsoever to any Borrower Party, the
Equityholder or any of the Related Companies.  (o) ERISA. 
(i) The present value of all benefits vested under each Pension Plan does not exceed the value of the assets of the Pension
Plan allocable to such vested benefits (based on the value of such assets as of the last annual valuation date) determined in accordance with the assumptions used for funding such Pension Plan pursuant to Sections 412 and 430 of the Code.
No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur, that, in the aggregate, could subject a Borrower Party to any material tax, penalty or other liability. 
  -43- 




(ii) Each Foreign Plan is in compliance in all material respects with its
terms and with the requirements of any and all applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders and has been maintained, where required, in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities. Except as could not, in the aggregate, subject
a Borrower Party to any material tax, penalty or other liability: (i) all contributions required to be made with respect to a Foreign Plan have been timely made; (ii) no Borrower Party has incurred any obligations in connection with the
termination of, or withdrawal from, any Foreign Plan; and (iii) the present value of the accrued benefit liabilities (whether or not vested) under each Foreign Plan, determined as of the end of such Borrower Partys most recently ended
fiscal year on the basis of reasonable actuarial assumptions, did not exceed the current value of the assets of such Foreign Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities. 
(iii) No Borrower Party (a) is a Benefit Plan Investor and (b) is a governmental plan within the meaning
of Section 3(32) of ERISA (Governmental Plan), and no Borrower Party nor any transactions by or with any Borrower Party are subject to state statutes regulating investments of and fiduciary obligations with respect to
Governmental Plans or to state statutes that impose prohibitions similar to those contained in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (Similar Law). 
(p) Value Given. The Borrower has given fair consideration and reasonably equivalent value to the Equityholder in exchange for the
purchase of the Warehouse Assets (or any number of them) from the Equityholder pursuant to the Sale Agreement. No such transfer has been made for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by such Borrower Party and no such transfer is or may be
voidable or subject to avoidance under any section of the Bankruptcy Code.  (q) Confirmation from Equityholder. The Borrower has
received in writing from the Equityholder confirmation that the Equityholder will not cause the Borrower to file a voluntary bankruptcy petition under the Bankruptcy Code. 
(r) Borrower LLC Agreement in Effect. The Borrower LLC Agreement remains in full force and effect and there
exists no breach of, default under, or threatened breach of, the Borrower LLC Agreement by the Borrower or the Equityholder.  (s)

Management Agreement.  ARTICLE VII 
Negative Covenants  Until
the occurrence of the Maturity Date and the payment in full of the Obligations, the Borrower covenants and agrees with the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Equityholder that without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent
(which consent may be withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of the Administrative Agent):  Section 7.01. Indebtedness.

except in connection with the transfer or contribution of Warehouse Assets by the Borrower to a Designated Subsidiary, (iii) divide or permit any division of it or enter into a plan of division with respect to it or (iv) amend its

purchase any Warehouse Assets prior to the Effective Date, on or after the Commitment Termination Date or following the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default. After the Effective Date, the Borrower shall not purchase or enter into any
commitments to purchase any Warehouse Assets if the Aggregate Traded Amount would equal or exceed the Maximum Limit after giving effect to such purchase or commitment to purchase. 
(b) The Borrower shall not purchase any Warehouse Asset on behalf of itself or through any Designated Subsidiary without the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a). The Borrower may transfer or contribute Warehouse Assets to a Designated Subsidiary in anticipation of a Permitted CLO and, if directed by the Warehouse
Collateral Manager with notice to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, cause the settlement of a Borrower Partys purchase of a Warehouse Asset into a Designated Subsidiary. The Borrower on behalf of itself or any Designated
Subsidiary shall not enter into any commitment to acquire any Warehouse Assets on any date on which an LTV Ratio Event has occurred and is continuing. For the avoidance of doubt, prior to the earlier of the occurrence of an Event of Default and the

any Warehouse Asset from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates with the proceeds of any Advance made by Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. in its capacity as a Lender; provided that the unintentional violation of this provision shall
not constitute an Event of Default so long as the Warehouse Collateral Manager, on behalf of a Borrower Party, uses commercially reasonable efforts to cancel any trade which it has actual knowledge would cause it to violate this covenant prior to
the date of settlement of such trade.  (d) No Borrower Party shall acquire a Warehouse Asset from an Affiliate other than (x) the
Equityholder pursuant to the Sale Agreement and (y) by a Designated Subsidiary from the Borrower.  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, in any other Collateral Document or the Warehouse Collateral Management Agreement, except as set forth in Article III hereto, the Equityholder (or an Affiliate thereof) shall not reacquire from any Borrower Party

Agent, unless it shall be conclusively determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Administrative Agent was grossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct in ascertaining the pertinent facts.

Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into the applicable Credit Documents. Each Lender and each Secured Party also acknowledges that it will,

provided, further, that, if Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. or its Affiliate ceases to be a Lender, the Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent without further action by any Person. Upon any resignation or removal of the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor, which successor must be a Lender or an Affiliate thereof. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor or assignee, such
successor or assignee shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the
Credit Documents. After the Administrative Agents resignation, assignment or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Section 9.01 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its

Agreement, the Credit Documents and the other documents to be delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, including, the fees and expenses of counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Collateral Agent and the Securities

Intermediary with respect thereto and with respect to advising the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Collateral Agent and the Securities Intermediary as to their respective rights and
remedies under this Agreement and the other documents to be delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, and (y) the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with any Credit Document, including its rights under this Section, or
in connection with the Advances made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such
Advances.  (b) The Borrower Parties shall indemnify the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses,
including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee (Losses) (for the avoidance of doubt, computed by taking into account provisions of Section 10.03(f)), incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the negotiation, execution or delivery of the Credit Documents, any amendment thereof or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, any action or
inaction taken in connection therewith, the performance by the parties thereto of their respective obligations or the exercise or enforcement of the parties thereto of their respective rights or the consummation of the Transactions or any other
transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) any Advance or the use of the proceeds therefrom, or (iii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort
or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. Other than with respect to the Collateral Agent and the Securities Intermediary,
this Section 10.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent Losses arising from any non-Tax claim. 
(c) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not (and shall not cause any other Borrower Party to) assert, and hereby
waives (on behalf of all Borrower Parties), any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of, the Credit Documents or any agreement or instrument contemplated by any Credit Document, the Transactions, any Advance or the use of the proceeds thereof. 
(d) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor. 
(e) The Securities Intermediary is an intended third party beneficiary of this Section 10.03. 
  -67- 




(f) All indemnification payments for Losses made pursuant to this
Article X shall be made on an after-tax basis. Accordingly, in determining the amount of any indemnification payment for a Loss suffered or incurred by an Indemnitee hereunder, the
amount of such Loss shall be (i) increased to take into account any additional tax cost incurred by the Indemnitee arising from the receipt of indemnification payments hereunder (Tax Costs) and (ii) decreased to take
into account any deduction, credit or other tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnitee with respect to such Loss (the Tax Benefits). In computing the amount of any such Tax Costs or Tax Benefits, the Indemnitee shall be
deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnification payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Losses. 
Section 10.04. Binding Power of the Credit Documents; Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of each Credit Document
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, the Equityholder, the Warehouse Collateral Manager, and their respective successors and assigns permitted under such Credit Document. 
(b) Neither the Borrower nor the Equityholder may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower or the Equityholder without such consent shall be null and void). Except as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, Participants and the Related Parties of the Lenders) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. After the formation of any Designated Subsidiary and prior to the effective transfer or contribution of any Warehouse Assets to such Designated Subsidiary, the Borrower
shall cause such Designated Subsidiary to execute a Designated Subsidiary Joinder Agreement and deliver such Designated Subsidiary Joinder Agreement to each of the Borrower and the Collateral Agent. 
(c) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (c)(ii) below, any Lender may, with the consent of the Borrower but without
the consent of any other Person, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Advances at the time owing to it) with notice to the Warehouse Collateral Manager and
the Equityholder (unless such assignment is to an Affiliate of the Lender, in which case no notice shall be required); provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for any such assignment by the Lender if (x) a Default or
an Event of Default has occurred or is continuing, (y) the Lender has determined that such assignment is required to avoid an anticipated or expected violation of any rule or regulation to which the Lender is subject or (z) such assignment
is to a Lender hereunder or an Affiliate thereof. Any attempted assignment by a Lender that does not comply with the requirements of this clause (c) shall be null and void. 
(ii) Assignments pursuant to this Section 10.04(c) shall be subject to the following additional
conditions:  (A) except with respect to Affiliate Assignments to the extent set forth in clause (B) below, each
partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all of the Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement; 
  -68- 




(B) if an assignment is to an Affiliate of a Lender (such assignment, an
Affiliate Assignment), such Lender may assign to its Affiliate its obligation to make one or more specified Advances to be used for the purchase of specified Warehouse Assets and the related right to receive payments of principal,
interest, fees and any other amounts in respect of such Advance without the assignment of any other rights or obligations of such Lender hereunder; provided that such assignment is made on or prior to the time of the funding of the applicable
Advance; and  (C) the assignee and the Lender shall execute and deliver an assignment and assumption agreement
substantially in the form of Schedule 4.  (iii) From and after the effective date specified in
each assignment and assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such assignment and assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the Lender thereunder
shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such assignment and assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an assignment and assumption covering all of the Lenders rights and obligations under
this Agreement, the Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.03); provided, that no assignee shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to
Section 2.12(a) than that to which the assignor would have been entitled to receive had no such assignment occurred. 
(iv) The Administrative Agent, as agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each assignment and
assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the parties hereto may treat each person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Lender and the Warehouse Collateral Manager, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Upon its receipt of a
duly completed assignment and assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the Administrative Agent shall accept such assignment and assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. Each Lender that sells a
participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and
stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Advances or other obligations under this Agreement (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of
the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitment, Advance or its other obligations) to any person except to the extent that such disclosure is
necessary to establish that such Commitment, Advance or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register
shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
  -69- 




(d) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Warehouse Collateral Manager or any other
Person sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a Participant) in all or a portion of the Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Advance
owing to it) or enter into a derivative or similar transaction having an effect similar to a participation. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.11 and
Section 2.12 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.12(c) and Section 2.12(g) (it being understood that the
documentation required under Section 2.12(c) and Section 2.12(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to Section 10.04(c). A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.11 and Section 2.12, with respect to a
participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change in law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable
participation.  (e) Without the consent of any party, each Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of the Lender, and this Section 10.04(e) shall not apply to or limit any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release the Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for the Lender as a party hereto. 
Section 10.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower (on behalf of itself and
each other Borrower Party) and the Equityholder herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Advances, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or a Lender may have had notice or knowledge
of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Advance or any other amount payable under
this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid. The provisions of Sections 2.12, 10.03 and 10.11 and Article IX shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Advances, the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Securities Intermediary, the expiration or termination of the Commitment or the
termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.  Section 10.06. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page of this Agreement by electronic mail shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 
  -70- 




Section 10.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular j

ONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO
(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

Section 10.10. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents
used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement. 
Section 10.11. Limited Recourse; No Petition. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no recourse shall be had for the
payment of any amount owing in respect of any Credit Document against any officer, director, employee, shareholder or incorporator of any Borrower Party or their respective successors or assigns. All Obligations (including, but not limited to, the
payment of principal, interest and any amount payable by way of indemnity) shall constitute limited recourse obligations of the Borrower Parties payable solely from the assets of the applicable Borrower Party (which assets shall not include, for the
avoidance of doubt, (x) with respect to any Designated Subsidiary, (a) the sum of U.S.$250 representing the proceeds of the Designated Subsidiarys issued ordinary share capital, (b) the sum of U.S.$250 representing the
transaction fees payable to the Designated Subsidiary for entering into the Designated Subsidiary Joinder Agreement or (c) the bank account in the Cayman Islands in which the money described in clauses (a) and (b) is held and any interest
thereon and (y) with respect to the Borrower, the funds attributable to the issuance of the membership interests in any Borrower Parties (collectively, Excepted Assets)) available for the payment of such obligations pursuant
to the terms of the Credit Documents. Except as expressly set forth in Section 10.05, a Borrower Partys obligations shall be extinguished upon payment of such obligations as provided in Article II and the
Security Agreement, and no further claim shall be made against a Borrower Party in respect of any shortfall after the extinction of such obligations. 
The Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Equityholder hereby agree not to commence, or join in the commencement of,
any proceedings in any jurisdiction for the bankruptcy, winding-up or liquidation of a Borrower Party or any similar proceedings until at least one year (or, if longer, the applicable preference period then in
effect) plus one day, after (A) if CLO Securities are not issued, the liquidation of all Warehouse Assets purchased in accordance with the Credit Agreement and (B) if CLO Securities are issued, payment in full of all CLO Securities issued
under all indentures relating to such CLO Securities; provided, however, that nothing in this clause shall preclude, or be deemed to estop, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (A) from taking any action
prior to the expiration of the applicable preference period in (x) any case or proceeding voluntarily filed or commenced by a Borrower Party, or (y) any involuntary insolvency proceeding filed or commenced against a Borrower Party by a
Person other than the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, respectively, or (B) from commencing against a Borrower Party or any properties of such Borrower Party any legal action which is not a bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, insolvency, moratorium or liquidation proceeding.  The foregoing restrictions are a material inducement for the parties
hereto to enter into this Agreement and the other applicable transaction documents and are an essential term of this Agreement. The Administrative Agent or a Borrower Party may seek and obtain specific performance of such restrictions (including
injunctive relief), including, without limitation, in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, moratorium or liquidation proceedings, or other similar proceedings under Cayman Islands law, United States federal or state bankruptcy
law or similar laws. 
  -72- 




The Borrower (on behalf of itself and each other Borrower Party) shall, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, promptly object to the institution of any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, moratorium or liquidation proceedings, or other similar proceedings under Cayman Islands law, United States federal or
state bankruptcy law or similar laws against a Borrower Party and take all necessary or advisable steps to cause the dismissal of any such proceeding; provided that such obligation shall be subject to the availability of funds therefor. 
Section 10.12. Confidentiality. 
The parties hereto agree that the existence and terms of this Agreement, the other Credit Documents and the Warehouse Collateral Management
Agreement and any information relating thereto (including, without limitation, pricing terms, portfolio information and models or other reports, whether oral or written) (collectively, the Confidential Information) shall be kept
confidential and shall not be disclosed, directly or indirectly, to any other person except to the respective employees, directors, auditors, accountants, counsel and other advisors of the parties hereto that are directly involved in the
considerations of the matters set forth herein and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) any party may disclose t

de information relating to the identities of the
parties, their affiliates, agents or advisors.  Section 10.13. Entire Agreement. 
This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and
supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, inducements and conditions, express or implied, oral or written, of any nature whatsoever with respect to the subject matter hereof. The express terms hereof control and supersede
any course of performance and/or usage of the trade inconsistent with any of the terms hereof. Moreover, the parties to this Agreement waive reliance on any representation made by any other party, whether orally or in writing, prior to the execution
of this Agreement. 
  -73- 




Section 10.14. Characterization of Conveyances Pursuant to each Sale Agreement.
 (a) It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the conveyance of the Warehouse Assets by the Equityholder to the Borrower and the
Borrower to a Designated Subsidiary, as applicable, as contemplated by the applicable Sale Agreement be, and be treated for all purposes as, a sale by the Equityholder or the Borrower, as applicable, of such Warehouse Assets. It is, further, not the
intention of the parties that such conveyance be deemed a pledge of the Warehouse Assets by the Equityholder or Borrower, as applicable, to the Borrower or a Designated Subsidiary, as applicable, to secure a debt or other obligation of the
Equityholder or the Borrower, as applicable. However, in the event that, notwithstanding the intent of the parties, the Warehouse Assets are held to continue to be property of the Equityholder or the Borrower, as applicable, then the parties hereto
agree that: (i) the applicable Sale Agreement shall also be deemed to be a security agreement under applicable law; (ii) as set forth in such Sale Agreement, the transfer of the Warehouse Assets provided for in such Sale Agreement shall be
deemed to be a grant by the Equityholder or the Borrower, as applicable, to the Borrower or the applicable Designated Subsidiary of a first priority security interest in all of the Equityholders or Borrowers, as applicable, right, title
and interest in and to the Warehouse Assets and all amounts payable to the holders of the Warehouse Assets in accordance with the terms thereof and all proceeds of the conversion, voluntary or involuntary, of the foregoing into cash, instruments,
securities or other property, including, all amounts from time to time held or invested in the Accounts, whether in the form of cash, instruments, securities or other property; (iii) the possession by a Borrower Party of Warehouse Assets and
such other items of property as constitute instruments, money, negotiable documents or chattel paper shall be, subject to clause (iv) below, for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to the UCC; and
(iv) acknowledgements from Persons holding such property shall be deemed acknowledgements from custodians, bailees or agents (as applicable) of the applicable Borrower Party for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under applicable
law. The parties further agree that any assignment of the interest of a Borrower Party pursuant to any provision hereof shall also be deemed to be an assignment of any security interest created pursuant to the terms of the applicable Sale Agreement.
Each Borrower Party shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement and the other Collateral Documents, take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that, if a Sale Agreement was deemed to create a security interest in the Warehouse Assets,
such security interest would be deemed to be a perfected security interest of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained as such throughout the term of this Agreement. 
(b) It is the intention of each of the parties hereto that the Warehouse Assets conveyed by the Equityholder to the Borrower or the Borrower to
a Designated Subsidiary, as applicable, pursuant to a Sale Agreement shall constitute assets owned by the Borrower or such Designated Subsidiary, as applicable, and shall not be part of the Equityholders or Borrowers, as applicable,
estate in the event of the filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against the Equityholder or Borrower, as applicable, under any bankruptcy or similar law. 
  -74- 




(c) Each Borrower Party agrees to treat, and shall cause the Equityholder and the Borrower,
as applicable, to treat, for all purposes, the transactions effected by a Sale Agreement as sales of assets to the Borrower. Each Borrower Party and the Warehouse Collateral Manager each hereby agree to cause the Equityholder to reflect in the
Equityholders financial records and to include a note in the publicly filed annual and quarterly financial statements of the Equityholder indicating that assets sold to a Borrower Party under a Sale Agreement are owned by such Borrower Party
that is consolidated in the Equityholders financial statements, the creditors of such Borrower Party have received security interests in such assets and such assets are not intended to be available to the creditors of the Equityholder (or any
other affiliate of the Equityholder). 
  -75- 




IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by
their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.

n as selected by the Warehouse Collateral Manager in its sole discretion; 
(f) With respect to a Warehouse Asset, if not determined pursuant to clause (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above, the

  Sch.3-2 




(g) With respect to any Warehouse Asset that is a DIP Loan, if such

that if any such Warehouse Asset that is a DIP Loan is newly issued and the Warehouse Collateral Manager expects a Moodys credit rating within 90 days, the Moodys Rating of such Warehouse Asset until such credit rating is obtained
from Moodys will be (1) for a period of up to 90 days after the acquisition of such Warehouse Asset, the Moodys Rating as determined by the Warehouse Collateral Manager in its sole discretion if the Warehouse Collateral Manager
certifies to the Administrative Agent that it believes that such Moodys Rating determined by the Warehouse Collateral Manager is commercially reasonable and will be at least equal to such rating and (2) thereafter, B3); 
provided that, for purposes of the determination of the Moodys Rating, if (1) the issuer or obligor of any Warehouse Asset

 (C) if such Warehouse Asset is not rated by S&P but there is a public issuer credit rating
of the issuer of such Warehouse Asset by S&P as published by S&P, or the guarantor which unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees such Warehouse Asset, then such issuer credit rating will at the election of the Warehouse Collateral Manager
be determined in accordance with subclause (i)(B) (for such purposes, treating such public issuer credit rating as if it were a rating of a parallel security); or 
(D) if such Warehouse Asset is a DIP Loan, no Moodys Rating or Moodys Default Probability Rating may be determined
based on a rating by S&P or any other rating agency;

other security or obligation of the issuer of such Warehouse Asset is rated by Moodys or S&P, and if Moodys has been requested by the Borrower, the Warehouse Collateral Manager or the issuer of such Warehouse Asset to assign a rating
or rating estimate with respect to such Warehouse Asset but such rating or rating estimate has not been received, pending receipt of such estimate, the Moodys Derived Rating for purposes of clause (d) of the definition of
Moodys Rating and Moodys Default Probability Rating (as applicable) of such Warehouse Asset will be (1) B3 if the Warehouse Collateral Manager certifies to the Administrative Agent that the

Probability Rating of such Warehouse Asset will be the rating which is one subcategory below the facility rating (whether public or private) of such DIP Loan rated by Moodys and (y) the Moodys Rating of such Warehouse Asset will be
the facility rating (whether public or private) of such DIP Loan rated by Moodys; provided, however, if such facility rating has been withdrawn by Moodys and a new facility rating has not been issued by Moodys, the
facility rating of such DIP Loan will be the facility rating from Moodys applicable to such DIP Loan prior to such withdrawal; or

(ii) a loan for which the security interest or lien (or the validity or
effectiveness thereof) in substantially all of its collateral attaches, becomes effective, or otherwise springs into existence after the origination thereof. 
S&P RATING 
S&P Rating: With respect to any Warehouse Asset, as of any date of determination, the rating determined in accordance
with the following methodology:  (a) with respect to a Warehouse Asset that is not a DIP Loan (a) if there is an
issuer credit rating of the issuer of such Warehouse Asset by S&P as published by S&P, or the guarantor which unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees such Warehouse Asset pursuant to a form of guaranty that meets S&Ps
then-current guarantee criteria for use in connection with this transaction, then the S&P Rating will be such rating (regardless of whether there is a published rating by S&P on the Warehouse Asset s of such issuer held by the Borrower;
provided, that private ratings (that is, ratings provided at the request of the obligor) may be used for purposes of this definition) or (b) if there is no issuer credit rating of the issuer by S&P but (1) there is a senior
secured rating on any obligation or security of the issuer, then the S&P Rating of such Warehouse Asset will be one sub-category below such rating; (2) if clause (1) above does not apply,
but there is a senior unsecured rating on any obligation or security of the issuer, the S&P Rating of such Warehouse Asset will equal such rating; and (3) if neither clause (1) nor clause (2) above applies, but there is
a subordinated rating on any obligation or security of the issuer, then the S&P Rating of such Warehouse Asset will be one sub-category above such rating; 
(b) with respect to any Warehouse Asset that is a DIP Loan, the S&P Rating thereof will be the credit rating assigned to
such issue by S&P, or if such DIP Loan was assigned a point-in-time rating by S&P that was withdrawn, such withdrawn rating may be used for 12 months after
the assignment of such rating (provided that if any such Warehouse Asset that is a DIP Loan is newly issued and the Warehouse Collateral Manager expects an S&P credit rating within 90 days, the S&P Rating of such Warehouse Asset
until such credit rating is obtained from S&P will be (1) for a period of up to 90 days after the acquisition of such Warehouse Asset, the S&P Rating as determined by the Warehouse Collateral Manager in its sole discretion if the
Warehouse Collateral Manager certifies to the Administrative Agent that it believes that such S&P Rating determined by the Warehouse Collateral Manager is commercially reasonable and will be at least equal to such rating and (2) thereafter,
CCC-);  (c) reserved; 
(d) if there is not a rating by S&P on the issuer or on an obligation of the issuer, then the S&P Rating may be
determined pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) below:  (i) if an obligation of the
issuer is not a DIP Loan and is publicly rated by Moodys, then the S&P Rating will be determined in accordance with the methodologies for establishing the Moodys Rating set forth above except that the S&P Rating of such
obligation will be (1) one sub-category below the S&P equivalent of the Moodys Rating if such Moodys Rating is Baa3 or higher and (2) two
sub-categories below the S&P equivalent of the Moodys Rating if such Moodys Rating is Ba1 or lower; 
  Sch.3-6 




(ii) the S&P Rating may be based on a credit estimate provided by
S&P, and in connection therewith, the Borrower, the Warehouse Collateral Manager on behalf of the Borrower or the issuer of such Warehouse Asset shall, prior to or within 30 days after the acquisition of such Warehouse Asset, apply (and
concurrently submit all available Information in respect of such application) to S&P for a credit estimate, which will be its S&P Rating; provided, that, if such Information is submitted within such
30-day period, then, pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, such Warehouse Asset has an S&P Rating as determined by the Warehouse Collateral Manager in its sole discretion if the Warehouse
Collateral Manager certifies to the Administrative Agent that it believes that such S&P Rating determined by the Warehouse Collateral Manager is commercially reasonable and will be at least equal to such rating; provided, further,
that if such Information is not submitted within such 30-day period, then, pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, the Warehouse Asset has (1) the S&P Rating as determined by the Warehouse
Collateral Manager for a period of up to 90 days after the acquisition of such Warehouse Asset and (2) an S&P Rating of CCC- following such 90-day
period; unless, during such 90-day period, the Warehouse Collateral Manager has requested the extension of such period and S&P, in its sole discretion, has granted such request; provided,
further, that if such 90-day period (or other extended period) elapses pending S&Ps decision with respect to such application, the S&P Rating of such Warehouse Asset will be CCC-; provided, further, that if the Warehouse Asset has had a public rating by S&P that S&P has withdrawn or suspended within six months prior to the date of such application for a
credit estimate in respect of such Warehouse Asset, the S&P Rating in respect thereof will be CCC- pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, and S&P may elect not to provide such
estimate until a period of six months have elapsed after the withdrawal or suspension of the public rating; provided, further, that the S&P Rating may not be determined pursuant to this clause (ii) if the Warehouse Asset is a
DIP Loan; provided, further, that such credit estimate will expire 12 months after the receipt thereof, following which such Warehouse Asset has an S&P Rating of CCC- unless,
during such 12-month period following the receipt of such credit estimate, the Borrower applies for renewal thereof, in which case such credit estimate will continue to be the S&P Rating of such Warehouse
Asset until S&P has confirmed or revised such credit estimate, upon which such confirmed or revised credit estimate will be the S&P Rating of such Warehouse Asset; provided, further, that such confirmed or revised credit
estimate will expire on the next succeeding 12-month anniversary of the date of the receipt thereof and (when renewed annually) on each 12-month anniversary thereafter;
and  (iii) with respect to a Warehouse Asset that is not a Defaulted Asset, the S&P Rating of such Warehouse Asset will
at the election of the Borrower (at the direction of the Warehouse Collateral Manager) be CCC- provided, that (1) neither the issuer of such Warehouse Asset nor any of its Affiliates
are subject 
  Sch.3-7 





to any bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings, (2) the issuer has not defaulted on any payment obligation in respect of any debt security or other obligation of the issuer at any time
within the two year period ending on such date of determination, (3) all such debt securities and other obligations of the issuer that are pari passu with or senior to the Warehouse Asset are current and the Warehouse Collateral Manager
reasonably expects them to remain current and (4) all Information with respect to such Warehouse Asset has previously been provided to S&P; or 
(e) with respect to a DIP Loan that has no issue rating by S&P, the S&P Rating of such DIP Loan will be, at the
election of the Borrower (at the direction of the Warehouse Collateral Manager), CCC- or the S&P Rating determined pursuant to clause (d)(ii) above; 
provided, that for purposes of the determination of the S&P Rating, (x) if the applicable rating assigned by S&P to an obligor or its
obligations is on credit watch positive by S&P, such rating will be treated as being one sub-category above such assigned rating and (y) if the applicable rating assigned by S&P to an
obligor or its obligations is on credit watch negative by S&P, such rating will be treated as being one sub-category below such assigned rating; provided further that, for purposes of
the determination of the S&P Rating, if (1) the issuer of any Warehouse Asset was a debtor under Chapter 11, during which time such issuer or any of its obligations (including any Warehouse Asset) either had an S&P rating of
SD or CC or lower from S&P or had an S&P rating that was withdrawn by S&P and (2) such issuer, obligor or selling institution, as applicable, is no longer a debtor under Chapter 11, then, notwithstanding the
fact that such issuer or any of its obligations (including any Warehouse Asset) continues to have an S&P rating of SD or CC or lower from S&P (or, in the case of any withdrawal, continues to have no S&P rating),
the S&P Rating for any such obligation (including any Warehouse Asset), issuer shall be deemed to be CCC-, so long as S&P has not taken any rating action with respect thereto since the date
on which the issuer ceased to be a debtor under Chapter 11.
