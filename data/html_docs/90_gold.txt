        Dollars with such currency (or the reverse thereof, as applicable) last provided (either by publication or otherwise provided to the Administrative Agent) by the applicable Thomson Reuters Corp., Refinitiv or any successor thereto (“Reuters”) source on the Business Day (New York City time) immediately preceding the date of determination or, if such service ceases to be available or ceases to provide that
        rate of exchange, as provided by such other publicly available information service which provides that rate of exchange at such time in place of Reuters chosen by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, not
        later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on each Revaluation Date, the Administrative Agent shall (x) determine the Spot Rate as of such Revaluation Date with respect to Euros and Pounds Sterling and (y) give notice thereof to the applicable
        Lenders and Ashland.  The Spot Rates so determined shall become effective (i) in the case of the initial Revaluation Date, on the Closing Date and (ii) in the case of each subsequent Revaluation Date, on the first Business Day immediately following
        such Revaluation Date (a “Reset Date”), shall remain effective until the next succeeding Reset Date and shall for all purposes of this Agreement (other than any provision
        expressly requiring the use of a current exchange rate) be the Spot Rates employed in converting any amounts between Dollars and such currency.

t of any Limited Condition Acquisition) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction
      or action, such “baskets” or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations.  If Ashland has made an LCA Election for any Limited Condition Acquisition, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio
      or “basket” on or following the relevant LCA Test Date and prior to the earlier of (i) the date on which such Limited Condition Acquisition is consummated or (ii) the date that the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition is
      terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition, any such ratio or “basket” shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming such Limited Condition Acquisition and other transactions in connection therewith
      (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) had been consummated.


1.09        Designation of Ashland.  The Dutch Borrower hereby appoints Ashland to act as its agent for all purposes of this Agreement, the other Loan
          Documents and all other documents and electronic platforms entered into in connection herewith and agrees that (a) Ashland may execute such documents and provide such authorizations on behalf of the Dutch Borrower as Ashland deems appropriate in
          its sole discretion and the Dutch Borrower shall be obligated by all of the terms of any such document and/or authorization executed on its behalf, (b) any notice or communication delivered by the Administrative Agent or a Lender to Ashland shall
          be deemed delivered to the Dutch Borrower and (c) the Administrative Agent or the Lenders may accept, and be permitted to rely on, any document, authorization, instrument or agreement executed by Ashland on behalf of the Dutch Borrower.

        existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been organized on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at such time.


ARTICLE II
THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS


2.01        The Loans.


(a)          The Term A Borrowing.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Term A Lender severally agrees to make a single loan in Dollars to Ashland at any time on or after the



-39-







Closing Date until the Term A Commitment Termination Date in an amount in Dollars not to exceed such Term A Lender’s Term A Commitment.  Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01(a)
      and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.  Term A Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein.


(b)          The Revolving Credit Borrowings.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Revolving Credit Lender severally agrees to make loans in Dollars, Euros or Pound Sterling (each such loan, a “Revolving Credit Loan”) to each Borrower from time to time, on any Business Day during the Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount the Dollar Equivalent of which
        does not exceed the amount of such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any Revolving Credit Borrowing, (i) the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Facility, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit
        Loans of any Lender, plus such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment; provided further that at no time shall any Revolving Credit Lender be
        obligated to make a Revolving Credit Loan to the Dutch Borrower if the making of such Revolving Credit Loan would result in the portion of the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings attributable to Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans made to, and
        Letters of Credit issued for the account of, the Dutch Borrower exceeding the Dutch Borrower Revolving Credit Sublimit.  Within the limits of each Revolving Credit Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions
        hereof, the Borrowers may borrow under this Section 2.01(b), prepay under Section 2.05, and
        reborrow under this Section 2.01(b).  Revolving Credit Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein; provided that Revolving Credit Loans denominated in Euros or Pound Sterling shall be Eurodollar Rate Loans.  Each Lender at its option may make any Loan by causing any domestic or
        foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the applicable
        Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.


2.02        Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans.


(a)          Each Term A Borrowing, each Revolving Credit Borrowing,
        each conversion of Term A Loans or Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made upon the applicable Borrower’s irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by
        telephone.  Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than (i) 1:00 p.m. three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans denominated in
        Dollars or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans denominated in Dollars to Base Rate Loans, (ii) 1:00 p.m. four Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans denominated in Euros or
        Pounds Sterling and (iii) 1:00 p.m. on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans.  Each telephonic notice by the applicable Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(a)
        must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Committed Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer.  Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
        in a principal amount equal to the Borrowing Minimum or a whole multiple equal to the Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof; provided that, in each case, a
        Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Loans that results from a continuation of an outstanding Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Loans may be in an aggregate principal amount that is equal to such outstanding Borrowing.  Except as provided
        in Section 2.03(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $300,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof; provided that, in each case, a Base Rate Loan may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the applicable Commitment.  Each
        Committed Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the applicable Bor-



-40-







rower is requesting a Term A Borrowing, a Revolving Credit Borrowing, a conversion of Term A Loans or Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation
      of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to
      be borrowed or to which existing Term A Loans or Revolving Credit Loans are to be converted,  (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto, (vi) in the case of a Borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans, the applicable
      Borrower with respect to such Borrowing and (vii) in the case of a Borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans, whether such Borrowing is to be denominated in Dollars, Euros or Pound Sterlings.  If the applicable Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a
      Committed Loan Notice or if the applicable Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Term A Loans or Revolving Credit Loans shall, (i) if denominated in Dollars, be made as Base Rate Loans,
      (ii) if denominated in Euros or Pound Sterlings, be made as a Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (iii) in the case of an outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan, shall be continued as a Eurodollar Rate Loan with an Interest Period of the same duration as the expiring
      Interest Period.  If the applicable Borrower fails to specify a Borrower for such Borrowing, the applicable Borrower for such Borrowing will be Ashland. If the applicable Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar
      Rate Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.  If the applicable Borrower fails to specify the currency for such Borrowing, then the
      requested Borrowing shall be made in Dollars.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Swing Line Loan may not be converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan.


(b)          Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the
        Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage under the applicable Facility of the applicable Term A Loans or Revolving Credit Loans, as the case may be, and if no timely notice of a
        conversion or continuation is provided by the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in Section 2.02(a).  In the case of a Term A Borrowing or a Revolving Credit Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent’s Office
        not later than 3:00 p.m. (or, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans denominated in Euros or Pound Sterling, not later than 10:00 a.m) on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice; provided that in the case of a Term A Borrowing or a Revolving Credit Borrowing on the Closing Date, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available in immediately available funds
        at the Administrative Agent’s Office not later than one hour after the Administrative Agent provides notice of the satisfaction of the conditions to the initial funding on the Closing Date.  Upon satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with Section 10.01) of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is
        the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the applicable Borrower in like funds as received by
        the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the applicable Borrower on the books of Scotiabank with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to the
        Administrative Agent by the applicable Borrower; provided, however,
        that if, on the date a Committed Loan Notice with respect to a Revolving Credit Borrowing is given by the applicable Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, first, shall be applied to
        the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be made available to the applicable Borrower as provided above.


(c)          Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate
        Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan.  If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no Loans of any Class may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar
        Rate Loans without the consent of a Majority in Interest of the Lenders of such Class.



-41-







(d)          The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
        applicable Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate.  At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify
        Ashland and the Lenders of any change in Scotiabank’s prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.


(e)          After giving effect to all Term A Borrowings, all
        conversions of Term A Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term A Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than six Interest Periods in effect in respect of the Term A Facility.  After giving effect to all Revolving
        Credit Borrowings, all conversions of Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other and all continuations of Revolving Credit Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than six Interest Periods in effect in respect of the Revolving Credit
        Facility.


2.03        Letters of Credit.


(a)          The Letter of Credit Commitment.


(i)          Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
        (A) each L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Revolving Credit Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03, (1) from time to time on any Business Day
        during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars, Euros or Pound Sterlings for the account of Ashland or its Subsidiaries (other than a Special Purpose Finance
        Subsidiary), and to amend or extend Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with Section 2.03(b), and (2) to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit;
        and (B) the Revolving Credit Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for the account of Ashland or its Subsidiaries and any drawings thereunder; provided that after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, (x) the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Facility, (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount
        of the Revolving Credit Loans of any Revolving Credit Lender, plus such Lender’s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations,
        plus such Lender’s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans, shall not exceed such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment,
        and (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit.  Each request by Ashland for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by Ashland that the L/C Credit
        Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence.  Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Ashland’s and its Subsidiaries’ ability to obtain Letters of
        Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly Ashland and its Subsidiaries may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed.  From and after the
        Closing Date, all Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant hereto, and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and governed by the terms and conditions hereof.


(ii)          No L/C Issuer shall issue any Letter of Credit if:


(A)          subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months after the date of issuance or last extension, unless a Majority in Interest of the
        Revolving Credit Lenders have approved such expiry date; or


(B)          the expiry date of such requested
        Letter of Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless all the Revolving Credit Lenders have approved such expiry date.



-42-







(iii)          No L/C Issuer shall be under any obligation to issue
        any Letter of Credit if:


(A)          any order, judgment or decree of any
        Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to such L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
        from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that such L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such L/C
        Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon such L/C Issuer any unreimbursed
        loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which such L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;


(B)          the issuance of such Letter of Credit
        would violate in any material respect one or more policies of such L/C Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally and customary for issuers of letters of credit;


(C)          except as otherwise agreed by the
        Administrative Agent and such L/C Issuer, such Letter of Credit is in an initial stated amount less than $10,000;


(D)          such Letter of Credit is to be
        denominated in a currency other than Dollars, Euros or Pound Sterlings;


(E)          such Letter of Credit contains any
        provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder; or


(F)          (x) a default of any Lender’s
        obligations to fund under Section 2.03(c) exists or (y) any Revolving Credit Lender is at such time a Defaulting Lender hereunder, in each case unless such L/C Issuer has
        entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to such L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with Ashland or such Lender to eliminate such L/C Issuer’s actual or reasonably determined potential Fronting Exposure
        (after giving effect to Sections 2.15(a)(iv) and 2.15(a)(v)) with respect to the Defaulting
        Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or such Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to which such L/C Issuer has actual or reasonably determined potential Fronting Exposure.


(iv)          No L/C Issuer shall be under any obligation to amend
        any Letter of Credit if (A) such L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to
        such Letter of Credit.


(v)          Each L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Revolving
        Credit Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and each L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the Issuer Documents pertaining
        to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term “Administrative Agent” as used in Article IX included such L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as
        additionally provided herein with respect to such L/C Issuer.



-43-







(b)          Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of
          Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit.


(i)          Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the
        case may be, upon the request of Ashland delivered to the applicable L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer.  Such Letter of
        Credit Application must be received by the applicable L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the applicable L/C Issuer may agree in a
        particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be.  In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in
        form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer:  (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the
        amount and currency thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of
        any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the applicable L/C Issuer may reasonably request.  In the case of a request for an
        amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which
        shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (4) such other matters as the applicable L/C Issuer may reasonably request.


(ii)          Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit
        Application, the applicable L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from Ashland and, if not, such L/C Issuer will
        provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof.  Unless the applicable L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Revolving Credit Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date
        of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to
        the terms and conditions hereof, such L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of Ashland (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance
        with such L/C Issuer’s usual and customary business practices.  Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the
        applicable L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit.


(iii)          If Ashland so requests in any applicable Letter of
        Credit Application, the applicable L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an “Auto-Extension









            Letter of Credit”); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit such L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least
        once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the “Non-Extension









            Notice Date”) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued.  Unless otherwise directed by the applicable L/C Issuer, Ashland shall not be required to make a specific request to such
        L/C Issuer for any such extension.  Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Credit Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of
        Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that such L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) such L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation at such time, to issue such Letter of Credit
        in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of



-44-







clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which
      may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Credit Lender or Ashland that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
      Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing such L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.


(iv)          Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or
        any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable L/C Issuer will also deliver to Ashland and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or
        amendment.


(v)          For so long as any Letter of Credit issued by an L/C
        Issuer other than Scotiabank is outstanding, such L/C Issuer shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on the last Business Day of each calendar month, and on each date that an L/C Credit Extension occurs with respect to any such Letter of Credit,
        a report in the form of Exhibit F hereto, appropriately completed with the information for every outstanding Letter of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer.


(c)          Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of
          Participations.


(i)          Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of
        Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the applicable L/C Issuer shall notify Ashland and the Administrative Agent thereof.  Not later than 11:00 a.m. (or, in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in Euros or Pounds
        Sterling, not later than noon) on the date of any payment by the applicable L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an “Honor Date”), Ashland shall reimburse
        such L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount in the applicable currency of such drawing equal to the amount of such drawing; provided that,
        if notice of any drawing permitted hereunder is not provided to Ashland prior to 9:00 a.m. on the Honor Date, then Ashland shall reimburse such L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing on the next
        succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing fees in respect of the applicable Letter of Credit.  If Ashland fails to so reimburse such L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
        each Revolving Credit Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the “Unreimbursed Amount”), and the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender’s
        Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof.  In such event, Ashland shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in Dollars to be disbursed on the Honor Date (or the next succeeding Business Day, as the case
        may be) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the Unreimbursed Amount (determined as of the Honor Date), without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section
            2.02 for the principal amount of Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section









            4.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice).  Any notice given by an L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i)
        may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness
        or binding effect of such notice.


(ii)          Each Revolving Credit Lender shall upon any notice
        pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent’s Office in an
        amount equal to its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Loan (which, solely in the case of a drawing denominated in
        Dollars, shall be a Base Rate Loan) under the Revolving Credit Facility to Ashland in such amount.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to such L/C Issuer.



-45-







(iii)        With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not
        fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, Ashland shall be deemed to
        have incurred from the applicable L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in an amount equal to, and denominated in the applicable currency of, the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together
        with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.  In such event, each Revolving Credit Lender shall make the payment set forth in Section 2.03(c)(ii)
        regardless of the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 and such Revolving Credit Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
        L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such
        Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03.


(iv)         Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Revolving
        Credit Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of
        such Lender’s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of such L/C Issuer.


(v)          Each Revolving Credit Lender’s obligation to make
        Revolving Credit Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be
        absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against such L/C Issuer, Ashland or any other Person for any reason
        whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.  No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of
        Ashland to reimburse such L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.


(vi)          If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available
        to the Administrative Agent for the account of any L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c)
        by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), such L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such
        amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate
        determined by such L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing.  If such Lender pays
        such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s committed Loan included in the relevant committed Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be.  A
        certificate of such L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(c)(vi)
        shall be conclusive absent manifest error.


(d)          Repayment of Participations.


(i)          At any time after any L/C Issuer has made a payment
        under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Credit Lender such Lender’s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if
        the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from Ashland or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by
        the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Revolving Credit Percent-



-46-







age thereof in the applicable currency of such Letter of Credit in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.


(ii)          If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for
        the account of any L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C
        Issuer its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such
        amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.  The obligations of the Lenders under this clause (ii) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of
        this Agreement.


(e)          Obligations Absolute.  The obligation of Ashland to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and
        shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:


(i)          any lack of validity or
        enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement or any other Loan Document;


(ii)          the existence of any claim,
        counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that Ashland or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting),
        such L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;


(iii)          any draft, demand, certificate or
        other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise
        of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;


(iv)          any payment by such L/C Issuer under
        such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by such L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee
        in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any
        proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or


(v)          any other circumstance or happening
        whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, Ashland or any of its Subsidiaries;


provided that the foregoing shall not excuse any L/C Issuer from liability to
      Ashland or any Subsidiary to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are waived by Ashland or such Subsidiary to the extent permitted by applicable Law) suffered by Ashland or such Subsidiary
      that are caused by such L/C Issuer’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.


Ashland shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of
      noncompliance with Ashland’s instructions or other irregularity, Ashland will immediately notify the applicable L/C Issuer.  Ashland shall be conclusively



-47-







deemed to have waived any such claim against such L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.


(f)          Role of L/C Issuer.  Each Lender and Ashland agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuers shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and
        documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.  None of the L/C Issuers, the
        Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuers shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the
        approval of the Revolving Credit Lenders or a Majority in Interest of the Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness,
        validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document.  Ashland hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of
        Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended
        to, and shall not, preclude Ashland’s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.  None of the L/C Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related
        Parties or any correspondent, participant or assignee of any L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.03(e);
        provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary
        notwithstanding, Ashland may have a claim against an L/C Issuer, and an L/C Issuer may be liable to Ashland, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by Ashland which Ashland
        proves were caused by such L/C Issuer’s willful misconduct or gross negligence or such L/C Issuer’s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly
        complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuers may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation,
        regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuers shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights
        or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.


(g)          Cash Collateral.  Upon the request of any L/C Issuer, (i) if the applicable L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, (ii) if,
        after the issuance of any Letter of Credit, any Revolving Credit Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or (iii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, then Ashland shall, in each case, as
        promptly as practicable (and in any event within two Business Days) Cash Collateralize, as applicable, in an amount in Dollars sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender), (A) the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations owing to the applicable L/C Issuer or (B) in the case of clause (ii) above, the
        Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of such Defaulting Lender of the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations owing to the applicable L/C Issuer, or, in the case of clause (iii), provide a back-to-back letter of credit in a face amount at
        least equal to the then undrawn amount of such L/C Obligation from an issuer and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer.  Sections 2.05
        and 8.02(c) set forth certain additional requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder.  Ashland hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the
        applicable L/C Issuer and the Revolving Credit Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing.  Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit
        accounts at the Administrative Agent or the applicable L/C Issuer.  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent or the
        applicable L/C Issuer or that the total



-48-







amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, Ashland will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the
      Administrative Agent or the applicable L/C Issuer, as additional funds to be deposited as Cash Collateral, an amount equal to the excess of (x) such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (y) the total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral
      that the Administrative Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim.  Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under
      applicable Laws, to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer.  To the extent that, at any time, the amount of Cash Collateral exceeds the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations at such time and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and
      is continuing, the excess shall be promptly refunded to Ashland.


(h)          Applicability of ISP and UCP.  Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable L/C Issuer and Ashland when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the
        rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance, shall apply
        to each commercial Letter of Credit.


(i)          Letter of Credit Fees.  Ashland shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the “Letter of Credit Fee”) for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the Dollar Equivalent (determined as of the applicable date of determination) of the daily
        amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit; provided, however,
        any Letter of Credit Fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the L/C Issuer pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Applicable
        Revolving Credit Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.15(a)(iv), with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the L/C Issuer for its
        own account.  For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section









            1.06.  Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit,
        on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears.  If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of
        Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Majority in
        Interest of the Revolving Credit Lenders, while any Event of Default pursuant to Section 8.01(a) exists, all overdue Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default
        Rate.  Fees payable under this Section 2.03(i) with respect to any Letter of Credit shall be payable in Dollars.


(j)          Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer.  Ashland shall pay directly to the respective L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee in Dollars with respect to each Letter of Credit issued
        by such L/C Issuer, at a rate separately agreed to between Ashland and such L/C Issuer, computed on the Dollar Equivalent (determined as of the applicable date of determination) of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit
        on a quarterly basis in arrears.  Such fronting fee shall be due and payable on the tenth Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December in respect of the most recently-ended quarterly period (or portion thereof, in the case
        of the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand.  For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn
        under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit



-49-







shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06.  In addition, Ashland shall pay directly
      to such L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect.  Such customary
      fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.  Fees payable under this Section 2.03(j) with respect to any Letter of Credit shall be payable in Dollars.


(k)          Conflict with Issuer Documents.  In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control.


(l)          Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries.  Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, Ashland shall be obligated to
        reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit.  Ashland hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of Ashland, and that
        Ashland’s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.


(m)          Resignation of any L/C Issuer. Any L/C Issuer may resign at any time by giving 30 days’ prior notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Ashland.  After the resignation of an L/C Issuer hereunder, the retiring L/C
        Issuer shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation, but shall not
        be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or to extend, renew or increase any existing Letter of Credit.


2.04        Swing Line Loans.


(a)          The Swing Line.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender agrees it may, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Revolving Credit Lenders set forth in this Section 2.04, in its sole discretion make loans in Dollars (each such loan, a “Swing Line Loan”) to either Borrower
        from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the
        Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment; provided that the Swing Line Lender shall be under no obligation to make Swing Line Loans at any time if any Lender is at such time a Defaulting Lender hereunder (unless that
        Defaulting Lender’s participation in the Swing Line Loan would be reallocated, in full, to non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with Section 2.15(a)(iv)); provided, further, however, that after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Facility at such time and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of
        the Revolving Credit Loans of any Revolving Credit Lender at such time, plus such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding
        Amount of all L/C Obligations at such time, plus such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans
        at such time shall not exceed such Revolving Credit Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment, and provided, further, that neither Borrower shall use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan.  Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof,
        either Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow
        under this Section 2.04.  Each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest only at a rate based on the Base Rate.  Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each
        Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the



-50-







product of such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage times the
      principal amount of such Swing Line Loan.


(b)          Borrowing Procedures.  Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon the applicable Borrower’s irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone.  Each such notice must
        be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date or such later time on the requested borrowing date as may be approved by the Swing Line Lender in its sole discretion, and
        shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000 (or, in the case of the Dutch Borrower, $200,000), and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day.  Each such telephonic notice must be
        confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer.  Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any
        telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will
        notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof.  Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Revolving Credit
        Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first and the second provisos to the first sentence of
        Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02
        is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the
        applicable Borrower.


(c)          Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.  (i)The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the applicable Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so
        request on its behalf), that each Revolving Credit Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender’s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding.  Such request shall be made in writing
        (which written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the
        minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Facility and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02.  The Swing Line Lender shall furnish Ashland with a copy of the applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent.  Each Revolving Credit Lender shall make an
        amount equal to its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the amount specified in such Committed Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative
        Agent’s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Committed Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Revolving Credit Lender that
        so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the applicable Borrower in such amount.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender.


(ii)          If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be
        refinanced by such a Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth
        herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Revolving Credit Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Revolving Credit Lender shall make the payment set forth in Section 2.04(c)(i) regardless of the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 and
        such Revolving Credit Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in
        respect of such participation.



-51-







(iii)          If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available
        to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c)
        by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand,
        such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a
        rate determined by the Swing Line Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing.  If
        such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Revolving Credit Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may
        be.  A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.


(iv)          Each Revolving Credit Lender’s obligation to make
        Revolving Credit Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not
        be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the applicable Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the
        occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.  No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrowers to
        repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.


(d)          Repayment of Participations.  (i)  At any time after any Revolving Credit Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing
        Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Revolving Credit Lender its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender.


(ii)          If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in
        respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05
        (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative
        Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.  The Administrative
        Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender.  The obligations of the Lenders under this clause (ii) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.


(e)          Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender.  The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the applicable Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans.  Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Base Rate Loan
        or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in
        respect of such Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.


(f)          Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender.  The Borrowers shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender.



-52-







2.05       Prepayments.


(a)          Optional.


(i)          The Borrowers may, upon notice to the Administrative
        Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Term A Loans and Revolving Credit Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided
        that (A) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (1) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (2) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (B) any prepayment of
        Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount equal to the Borrowing Minimum or a whole multiple equal to the Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof; and (C) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $300,000 or a
        whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding.  Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment with respect to each Class of Loans to be prepaid
        and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each applicable Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the
        amount of such Lender’s ratable portion of such prepayment (based on such Lender’s Applicable Percentage in respect of the relevant Facility).  If such notice is given by a Borrower, such Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount
        specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein; provided that a notice of optional prepayment may state that such notice is
        conditional upon the effectiveness of any facility or instrument refinancing all or a portion of the outstanding Term A Loans or Revolving Credit Loans and Revolving Credit Commitments or upon the consummation of an acquisition transaction, in
        which case such notice of prepayment may be revoked by the applicable Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be
        accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05.


(ii)          Each prepayment of the outstanding Term A Loans
        pursuant to Section 2.05(a)(i) shall be applied to the then remaining principal repayment installments of the Term A Facility as the applicable Borrower directs, and each
        prepayment of Term A Loans and Revolving Credit Loans shall be paid to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages in respect of each of the relevant Facilities.


(iii)          The Borrowers may, upon notice to the Swing Line
        Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (A) such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the prepayment and (B) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of
        $100,000.  Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment.  If such notice is given by a Borrower, such Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date
        specified therein.


(b)          Mandatory.


(i)          If for any reason (A) the Total Revolving Credit
        Outstandings at any time exceed the Revolving Credit Facility at such time (other than as a result of any revaluation of the Dollar Equivalent of the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings on any Revaluation Date in accordance with Section 1.07) or (B) the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings at any time exceed 103% of the Revolving Credit Facility at such time (solely as a result of any revaluation of
        the Dollar Equivalent of the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings on any Revaluation Date in accordance with Section 1.07), the Borrowers shall immediately (or, in the
        case of clause (B), within two Business Days after receipt of notice from the Administrative



-53-







Agent of such event) prepay Revolving Credit Loans, L/C Borrowings and Swing Line Loans and/or Cash Collateralize such L/C Obligations (other than the L/C Borrowings) in an
      aggregate amount equal to such excess.


(i)          Prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility made
        pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.05(b), first, shall be applied ratably to the L/C Borrowings and Swing Line Loans, second, shall be applied ratably to the
        outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, and, third, shall be used to Cash Collateralize the remaining L/C Obligations.  Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit that has been Cash Collateralized, the funds held as Cash Collateral shall be applied
        (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrowers) to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer or the Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable.


2.06        Termination or Reduction of Commitments.


(a)          Optional.  The Borrowers may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Revolving Credit Facility, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Swing Line Sublimit or the Term A Commitments or from time to time
        permanently reduce the Revolving Credit Facility, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Swing Line Sublimit or the Term A Commitments; provided that (i) any
        such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. three Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole
        multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (iii) the Borrowers shall not terminate or reduce (A) the Revolving Credit Facility if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings
        would exceed the Revolving Credit Facility, (B) the Letter of Credit Sublimit if, after giving effect thereto, the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations not fully Cash Collateralized hereunder would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit or (C) the
        Swing Line Sublimit if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Outstanding Amount of Swing Line Loans would exceed the Swing Line Sublimit.  A notice of termination or reduction of the Revolving Credit
        Facility, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Swing Line Sublimit or the Term A Commitments delivered by the Borrowers may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of any facility or instrument refinancing all or a portion of the
        outstanding Term A Commitments or Revolving Credit Commitments or upon the consummation of an acquisition transaction, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrowers (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified
        effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.


(b)          Mandatory.


(i)          The aggregate Term A Commitments shall be
        automatically and permanently reduced to zero at the earlier of (x) the close of business on the Term A Funding Date and (y) the close of business on the Term A Commitment Termination Date.


(ii)          If after giving effect to any reduction or
        termination of Revolving Credit Commitments under this Section 2.06, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the Revolving Credit Facility at
        such time, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit, as the case may be, shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess.


(c)          Application of Commitment Reductions; Payment of Fees.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any termination or reduction of the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Swing Line Sublimit, the Revolving
        Credit Commitments or the Term A Commitments under this Section 2.06.  Upon any reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments, the Revolving Credit Commitment of each
        Revolving Credit Lender shall be reduced by such Lender’s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of such reduction amount.  Upon any reduction of the Term A Commitments, the Term A Commitment of each Term A Lender shall be reduced by such Lender’s
        Applicable Term A Percentage of such reduction



-54-







amount.  All fees in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Revolving Credit Facility shall be paid on the
      effective date of such termination.


2.07        Repayment of Loans.


(a)          Term A Loans.  Ashland shall repay to the Term A Lenders the aggregate principal amount of all Term A Loans outstanding on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December of each year (commencing on the
        applicable day of the first full fiscal quarter of Ashland after the Closing Date) and on the applicable Maturity Date for the Term A Facility (each such date being referred to as an “Term









            A Loan Installment Date”), in an aggregate principal amount (which amount shall be reduced as a result of the application of prepayments in accordance with the order of priority set forth in Section 2.05(a)(ii)) equal to:


(i)          0.00% of the aggregate principal
        amount of such Term A Loans funded on the Term A Funding Date on each Term A Loan Installment Date occurring on or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date;


(ii)          1.25% of the aggregate principal
        amount of such Term A Loans funded on the Term A Funding Date on each Term A Loan Installment Date occurring after the second anniversary, but on or prior to the third anniversary, of the Closing Date;


(iii)          2.50% of the aggregate principal
        amount of such Term A Loans funded on the Term A Funding Date on each Term A Loan Installment Date occurring after the third anniversary, but on or prior to the fourth anniversary, of the Closing Date; and


(iv)          5.00% of the aggregate principal
        amount of such Term A Loans funded on the Term A Funding Date on each Term A Loan Installment Date occurring after the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date; provided,
        however, that the final principal repayment installment of the Term A Loans shall be repaid on the Maturity Date for the Term A Facility and in any event
        shall be in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all Term A Loans outstanding on such date.


(b)          Revolving Credit Loans.  The Borrowers shall repay to the Revolving Credit Lenders on the Maturity Date for the Revolving Credit Facility the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans outstanding on such
        date.


(c)          Swing Line Loans.  The Borrowers shall repay each Swing Line Loan on the earlier to occur of (i) the date ten Business Days after such Loan is made and (ii) the Maturity Date for the Revolving Credit Facility.


2.08        Interest.


(a)          Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08(b), (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan under a Facility shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the
        Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate for such Facility; (ii) each Base Rate Loan under a Facility shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum
        equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for such Facility; and (iii) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for the Revolving Credit Facility.



-55-







(b)          (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid
        when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum
        at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.


(ii)          If any amount (other than principal of any Loan)
        payable by either Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders such amount shall
        thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.


(c)          Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts
        (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.


(d)          Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in
        arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein.  Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
        commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.


2.09        Fees.  In addition to certain fees described in Sections 2.03(i) and (j):


(a)          Commitment Fees.


(i) Ashland shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with its Applicable
      Revolving Credit Percentage, a commitment fee equal to the Applicable Fee Rate times the actual daily amount by which the Revolving Credit Facility exceeds the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and (ii) the Outstanding
      Amount of L/C Obligations.  The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV
      is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period. 
      The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Fee Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Fee Rate separately for each period
      during such quarter that such Applicable Fee Rate was in effect.


(ii) Ashland shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Term A Lender in accordance with its Applicable Term A
      Percentage, a ticking fee equal to the Applicable Fee Rate times the actual daily amount of the Term A Commitments.  The ticking fee shall accrue at all times from and after the date that is 61 days after the Closing Date to the Term A Commitment
      Termination Date for so long as any Term A Commitments remain outstanding, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and
      shall be due and payable in arrears on the earlier of (x) the date of the initial funding of the Term A Loans and (y) the Term A Commitment Termination Date (or, if earlier, the date on which all Term A Commitments have been terminated in accordance
      with Section 2.06(a)).  The ticking fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Fee Rate during any quarter, the
      actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Fee Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Fee Rate was in effect.



-56-







(b)          Other Fees.


(i)          Ashland shall pay to the
        Administrative Agent and each Arranger for their own respective accounts, fees as separately agreed among Ashland and the Administrative Agent or such Arranger, as the case may be.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be
        refundable for any reason whatsoever.


(ii)          Ashland shall pay to the Lenders
        such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.


2.10        Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Rate.


(a)          All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans
        (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and actual days elapsed, and all computations of interest for Loans denominated in Pounds Sterling
        shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days and actual days elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable,
        being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).  Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section









            2.12(a), bear interest for one day.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.


(b)          If, as a result of any restatement of or other
        adjustment to the financial statements of Ashland or for any other reason, Ashland or the Lenders reasonably determine that (i) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio as calculated by Ashland as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper
        calculation of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, then the Borrowers shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable
        Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrowers under the Bankruptcy Code of the
        United States or the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet), automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C
        Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period.  This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the
        Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under Section 2.03(c)(iii), 2.03(i)
        or 2.08(b) or under Article VIII.  The Borrowers’ obligations under this paragraph shall
        survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.


2.11        Evidence of Debt.


(a)          The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be
        evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent
        manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the
        Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such
        matters, the accounts and



-57-







records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, Ashland, and the
      Dutch Borrower if applicable, shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and
      endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.


(b)          In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.11(a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such
        Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the
        accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.


2.12        Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback.


(a)          General.  All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the
        Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent’s Office in the currency as specified herein (or, if no such currency is so
        specified, Dollars) and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage in respect of the relevant Facility (or other
        applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding
        Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  If any payment to be made by the Borrowers shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of
        time shall be reflected on computing interest or fees, as the case may be.  For the avoidance of doubt, all payments made by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in Euros or Pound Sterlings shall be
        made in such currency to such account as may be specified by the Administrative Agent.  If, for any reason, either Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in Euros or Pound Sterlings, such Borrower shall make
        such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent (determined as of the applicable date of determination) of such currency’s payment amount.


(b)          Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed time of any Borrowing of Loans that such Lender will not make
        available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section









            2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative
        Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the
        date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the
        Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a
        payment to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate



-58-







Loans.  If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
      remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in
      such Borrowing.  Any payment by either Borrower under this Section 2.12(b) shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.


(c)          Payments by Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the applicable Borrower prior to the time at which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent
        for the account of the Lenders or any L/C Issuer hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon
        such assumption, distribute to the Appropriate Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Appropriate Lenders or the
        applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day
        from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, (A) if such amount is denominated in Dollars, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the
        Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) if such amount is denominated in Euros or Pound Sterlings, the rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be its cost of funding such
        amount.


A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or either Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive,
      absent manifest error.


(d)          Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent.  If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the applicable Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to
        such Lender, without interest.


(e)          Obligations of Lenders Several.  The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Term A Loans and Revolving Credit Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of
        any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).


(f)          Funding Source.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain
        the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.


(g)          Insufficient Funds.  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, L/C Borrowings, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall
        be applied (i) first, toward payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and
        fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, toward payment of principal and L/C Borrowings then due hereunder, rata-



-59-







bly among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and L/C Borrowings then due to such parties.


2.13        Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of (a) Obligations in respect of any of the Facilities due and payable to such
        Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the
        Obligations in respect of such Facility due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of such Facility due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and
        under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the Lenders at such time or (b) Obligations in respect of any of such Facility owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in
        excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of such Facility owing (but not
        due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payment on account of the Obligations in respect of such Facility owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan
        Documents at such time obtained by all of the Lenders at such time, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and
        subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders in respect of such Facility ratably in
        accordance with the aggregate amount of Obligations in respect of such Facility then due and payable to the Lenders or owing (but not due and payable) to the Lenders, as the case may be; provided that:


(a)          if any such participations or
        subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest;
        and


(b)          the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the
        application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (B) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing
        Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the applicable Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall apply)
        or (C) Cash Collateral or other security given by either Borrower or any Lender to the L/C Issuer pursuant to this Agreement.


Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
      participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such
      participation.


2.14        Increase in Facility.


(a)          Request for Increase.  Upon notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers may at any time and from time to time request (x) an increase in the Revolving Credit Facility (the “Incremental Revolving Commitments”) by an amount (for all such requests, together with all requests pursuant to clause (y) below) not exceeding the greater of (A) $500,000,000 and (B) an amount equal to 1.00x
        Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter period of Ashland (as set forth in the applicable Compliance Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.02(a)); provided that any such request



-60-







for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000, and/or (y) an increase in the Term A Facility (each, an “Incremental Term Loan Commitment” and the loans made pursuant thereto, the “Incremental Term Loans”) by an amount (for all such requests, together
      with all requests pursuant to clause (x) above) not exceeding the greater of (A) $500,000,000 and (B) an amount equal to 1.00x Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter period of Ashland (as set forth in the applicable
      Compliance Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.02(a)); provided that any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000.


(b)          Additional Lenders.  Each request for increase pursuant to Section 2.14(a) shall specify the identity of each Eligible Assignee to whom the
        Borrowers propose any portion of such increased Incremental Revolving Commitments or such increased Incremental Term Loan Commitments be allocated and the amounts of such allocations; provided that any existing Lender approached to provide all or a portion of the increased Incremental Revolving Commitments or the increased Incremental Term Loan Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole
        discretion, to provide such increased Incremental Revolving Commitments or such increased Incremental Term Loan Commitments.  Any such allocation to an Eligible Assignee shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and (solely with
        respect to an Incremental Revolving Commitment) each L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld).


(c)          Effective Date and Allocations.  If the Revolving Credit Facility or Term A Facility is increased in accordance with this Section 2.14, the
        Administrative Agent and Ashland shall determine the effective date (the “Increase Effective Date”) and the final allocation of such increase or creation.  The
        Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Ashland and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase or creation and the Increase Effective Date.


(d)          Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase.  As a condition precedent to such increase, (w) the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Borrower (or, in the case of an increase of the Term A
        Facility, of Ashland) dated as of the Increase Effective Date signed by a Responsible Officer (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by each Borrower (or, in the case of an increase of the Term A Facility, by Ashland) approving or
        consenting to such increase, and (ii) certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase or creation, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article V
        and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects (except that any representation and warranty that is qualified as to “materiality” or “Material Adverse Effect” shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the
        Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct in all material respects (or in all respects, as the case may be) as of such
        earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.14, the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished 

emental Revolving Commitments (the “Incremental Revolving Loans”) shall be identical to
      the Revolving Credit Loans and (y) to the extent that the increase of the Commitments shall take the form of an increase of the Term A Facility, the terms and provisions of the Incremental Term Loans made pursuant to such Incremental Term Loan
      Commitments shall be identical to the Loans of the Term A Facility.  Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all references in the Loan Documents to Revolving Credit Loans or Term A Loans shall be deemed to include references to Incremental
      Revolving Loans and Incremental Term Loans, as applicable, and all references to Loans shall be deemed to include references to Incremental Revolving Loans and Incremental Term Loans, in each case, made pursuant to any Incremental Revolving
      Commitments and Incremental Term Loan Commitments, respectively, made under this Section 2.14.  With respect to the Incremental Revolving Commitments, the Borrowers shall
      prepay any Base Rate Loans outstanding on any Increase Effective Date and all Eurodollar Rate Loans at the earlier of the end of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto or the occurrence of an Event of Default (and pay any additional
      amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Revolving Credit
      Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Revolving Credit Commitments under this Section 2.14; provided that any prepayment required pursuant to this sentence can be funded with the proceeds of one or more concurrent Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.  With respect to the Incremental Revolving
      Commitments, on any Increase Effective Date, each Revolving Credit Lender that increased its Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.14 and each Revolving
      Credit Lender that became a Revolving Credit Lender in connection with this Section 2.14 (i) will be deemed to have purchased a participation in each then outstanding
      Eurodollar Rate Loan that remains unpaid and Letter of Credit equal to its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of such Revolving Credit Loan or Letter of Credit and the participation of each other Revolving Credit Lender in such Letter of Credit
      shall be adjusted accordingly and (ii) will acquire (and will pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to) its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of all
      Unreimbursed Amounts, including all L/C Borrowings.  Incremental Revolving Commitments and Incremental Term Loan Commitments shall be evidenced by a joinder agreement satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and Ashland.  Notwithstanding any other
      provision of any Loan Document, the Loan Documents may be amended by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers (which amendment shall not require the consent of any Lender, other than any Lender participating in the applicable Incremental Revolving
      Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments, as the case may be) in order to make any modifications, if necessary, to provide for Incremental Revolving Commitments and Incremental Term Loan Commitments and loans thereunder, including, for the
      avoidance of doubt, modifications to the amortization schedule to reflect any increase in the Term A Facility.  Any upfront fees, arrangement fees or other similar fees for any Incremental Revolving Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments
      shall be as agreed between the Borrowers and the applicable lenders providing such Incremental Revolving Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments.


(e)          Conflicting Provisions.  This Section 2.14 shall supersede any provisions in Sections









            2.13 or 10.01 to the contrary.


2.15        Defaulting Lenders.


(a)          Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted
        by applicable Law:



-62-







(i)          Waivers and Amendments.  That Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 10.01.


(ii)          Reallocation of Payments.  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether
        voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting
        Lender), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by
        that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to
        any L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by any L/C Issuer, to be held as Cash
        Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Letter of Credit; fourth, as Ashland may request (so long as
        no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and Ashland, to be held in a non-interest bearing
          deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x)
          satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers’ future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued
        under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.03(g); sixth, to the payment
        of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the L/C Issuers or the Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a
        result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment
        of any amounts owing to either Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by such Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this
        Agreement; and eighth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y)
        such Loans or L/C Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the
        Loans of, and L/C Borrowings owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded
        participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Facility
        without giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv).  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts
        owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each
        Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  Promptly (x) upon a Lender ceasing to be a Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.15(b) or (y) following termination of this
        Agreement (including the termination of all Letters of Credit issued hereunder) and the payment of all amounts owed under this Agreement (other than unasserted contingent obligations which by their terms survive the termination of this Agreement),
        all remaining amounts, if any, held in a deposit account pursuant to this Section 2.15(a) shall be returned to such Lender or Defaulting Lender, as applicable.


(iii)          Certain Fees.  That Defaulting Lender (x) shall not be entitled to receive any commitment fee pursuant to Section









            2.09(a) for any period during which such Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and Ashland shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have



-63-







been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender) and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive Letter of Credit Fees as provided in Section 2.03.


(iv)         Reallocation of Applicable Revolving Credit Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure.  All or any part of that Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be
        reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Revolving Credit Percentages (calculated without regard to that Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause
        the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of any Lender plus such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage (calculated
        without regard to that Defaulting Lender’s Commitments) of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans to exceed such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment; provided that each such reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Default or Event of Default exists.  Subject to Section 10.20, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting
        Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.


(v)          Cash Collateral; Repayment of Swing Line Loans.  If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall without prejudice to any right or
        remedy available to it hereunder or under Law, (x) first, prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lender’s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender; provided that such prepayment shall be applied to reduce such Defaulting Lender’s participation in such Swing Line Loans and shall not reduce any non-Defaulting Lender’s participation in such Swing Line Loans, and (y)
        second, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers’ Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.03(g).


(b)          Defaulting Lender Cure.  If Ashland, the Administrative Agent, each L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender agree in
        writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to
        any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as
        the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable 
        Percentages of the applicable Facility (without giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of either Borrower while such Lender was a
        Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the
        extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.


2.16        Extended Loans and Commitments.


(a)          Ashland may at any time and from time to time request
        that all or any portion of the Loans and Commitments of any Class (an “Existing Class”) be converted to extend the final maturity date of such Loans and Commitments (any
        such Loans which have been so converted, “Extended Maturity Loans” and any such Commitments which have been so converted, “Extended Maturity Commitments”)



-64-







and to provide for other terms consistent with this Section 2.16; provided that there may be no more than eight different Classes in the aggregate for all Loans and Commitments under this Agreement without the consent of the Administrative Agent
      (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).  In order to establish any Extended Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity Commitments, Ashland shall provide a notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall provide a copy
      of such notice to each of the Lenders under the applicable Existing Class) (an “Extension Request”) setting forth the proposed terms of the Extended Maturity Loans and/or
      Extended Maturity Commitments, as applicable, to be established, which shall be substantially identical to the Loans under the Existing Class from which such Extended Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity Commitments, as applicable, are to be
      converted, except that:


(i)          all or any of the scheduled
        amortization payments of principal of the Extended Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity Commitments (including the maturity date) may be delayed to later dates than the scheduled amortization payments of principal of the Loans and/or Commitments
        (including the maturity date) of such Existing Class to the extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment;


(ii)          the Applicable Rate with respect to
        the Extended Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity Commitments may be different than the Applicable

plicable Existing Class under this Agreement after giving effect to the Extension Amendment except after the Maturity Date with respect to such Existing Class; and


(iv)         the Extension Amendment may provide
        that optional and mandatory prepayments pursuant to Section 2.05 be directed to prepay, at Ashland’s option, first, the applicable Existing Class and, second, the
        Extended Maturity Loans.


Any Extended Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity Commitments converted pursuant to any Extension Request shall be designated a Class of Extended
      Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity Commitments for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that any Extended Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity
      Commitments converted from an Existing Class may, to the extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment, be designated as an increase in any previously established Class.


(b)          Ashland shall provide the applicable Extension Request
        to all Lenders of the Existing Class at least five Business Days prior to the date on such Lenders are requested to respond.  No Lender shall have any obligation to agree to have any of its Loans and/or Commitments of any Existing Class converted
        into Extended Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity Commitments pursuant to any Extension Request.  Any Lender wishing to have all or any portion of its Loans and/or Commitments under such Existing Class subject to such Extension Request
        converted into Extended Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity Commitments, as applicable (such Lender, an “Extending Lender”), shall notify the Administrative Agent (an
        “Extension Election”) on or prior to the date specified in such Extension Request of the amount of its Loans and/or Commitments under the Existing Class which it has
        elected to request be converted into Extended Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity Commitments (subject to any minimum denomination requirements reasonably imposed by the Administrative Agent); provided that for any Extension Request, Ashland may establish a maximum amount for such Extended Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity Commitments (an “Extension Maximum Amount”).  In the event that



-65-







the aggregate amount of Loans and/or Commitments under the Existing Class subject to Extension Elections exceeds the Extension Maximum Amount, then each Extending Lender’s
      amount of consented Loans and/or Commitments subject to an Extension Election shall be reduced on a pro rata
      basis such that the total amount of Extended Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity Commitments shall equal the Extension Maximum Amount.


(c)          Extended Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity
        Commitments shall be established pursuant to an amendment (an “Extension Amendment”) to this Agreement among the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each Extending
        Lender, which shall be consistent with the provisions set forth in paragraph (a) and (b) above (but which shall not require the consent of any other Lender other than the Extending Lenders (including any changes contemplated by Section 10.01(f)), and which shall, in the case of Extended Maturity Commitments in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, make appropriate modifications to this Agreement
        (including to the definitions of “Availability Period,” “Revolving Credit Commitment,” “Fronting Exposure” and “Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage,” and to Sections 2.03
        and 2.04) to provide for issuance of Letters of Credit and the extension of Swing Line Loans based on such Extended Maturity Commitments and make any additional
        modifications, if necessary, to provide for terms applicable to Extended Maturity Commitments and Extended Maturity Loans thereunder.  Only Extending Lenders will have their Loans and/or Commitments converted into Extended Maturity Loans and/or
        Extended Maturity Commitments and, at Ashland’s discretion, only Extending Lenders will be entitled to any increase in pricing or fees in connection with the Extension Amendment.  Each Extension Amendment shall be binding on the Lenders, the
        Borrowers and the other parties hereto.


(d)          In the event that the Administrative Agent determines in
        its sole discretion that the allocation of Extended Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity Commitments, in each case to a given Extending Lender, was incorrectly determined as a result of manifest administrative error in the receipt and processing
        of an Extension Election timely submitted by such Lender in accordance with the procedures set forth in the applicable Extension Amendment, then the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers and such affected Extending Lender may (and hereby are
        authorized to), in their sole discretion and without the consent of any other Lender, enter into an amendment to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (each, a “Corrective
            Extension Amendment”), which Corrective Extension Amendment shall (i) provide for the conversion and extension of Loans and/or Commitments, as the case may be, under the Existing Class in such amount as is required to cause such
        Extending Lender to hold Extended Maturity Loans and/or Extended Maturity Commitments, as the case may be, of the applicable Class into which such other Loans and/or Commitments, as the case may be, were initially converted, in the amount such
        Extending Lender would have held had such administrative error not occurred and had such Extending Lender received the minimum allocation of the applicable Loans and/or Commitments to which it was entitled under the terms of such Extension
        Amendment, in the absence of such error, (ii) be subject to the satisfaction of such conditions as the Administrative Agent, Ashland and such Extending Lender may agree (including conditions of the type required to be satisfied for the
        effectiveness of an Extension Amendment described in Section 2.16(c)), and (iii) effect such other amendments of the type (with appropriate reference and nomenclature
        changes) described in the first sentence of Section 2.16(c).


ARTICLE III
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY


3.01       Taxes.


(a)          Payments Free of Certain Taxes; Obligation to
          Withhold; Payments on Account of Certain Taxes.



-66-







(1)          All payments by or on account of any obligation of any
        Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to the extent permitted by applicable Laws be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes.  If, however, applicable Laws require the applicable Withholding
        Agent to withhold or deduct any Tax from or with respect to any such payment, such Tax shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with such Laws as determined by such Withholding Agent.


(2)          If the applicable Withholding Agent shall be required by
        applicable Laws to withhold or deduct any Taxes, then (A) such Withholding Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by such Withholding Agent to be required, (B) such Withholding Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld
        or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (C) to the extent that such withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by or on account of
        any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document or on account of Other Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after all such withholding or deduction has been made (including any
        deduction or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer (or where the Administrative
        Agent receives a payment for its own account, the Administrative Agent) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made; provided, however, that in the case of a Withholding Agent that is not a Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, the amount
        payable under this clause (C) shall not exceed the amount that would have been required to be paid had a Loan Party or the Administrative Agent been the applicable Withholding Agent.


(b)          Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers.  Without limiting the provisions of Section 3.01(a), but without duplication, the Borrowers shall timely
        pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws.


(c)          Tax Indemnifications.


(1)          Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, Ashland (jointly and severally with respect to the obligations of
        all the Borrowers) and the Dutch Borrower (solely with respect to the obligations of the Dutch Borrower) shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each L/C Issuer, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after
        demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment made by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document or otherwise with respect to any other Loan Document or any
        Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01) paid or payable by the
        Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by
        the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to Ashland by a Lender or an L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or
        on behalf of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.


(2)          Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a), (b) or (c)(1) above, each Lender and each L/C Issuer, severally and not jointly,
        shall indemnify the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender or such L/C Issuer (as the case may be) that are
        payable by the Loan Parties or the Administrative Agent (and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or related thereto) as a result of the failure by such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to deliver, or as a result of the
        inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any documentation required to be delivered by such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to Ashland or the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section



-67-







3.01(e), in each case, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted
      by the relevant Governmental Authority.  The agreements in this clause (2) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or an L/C Issuer, the termination of
      the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations.


(d)          Evidence of Payments.  After any payment of Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, such Loan Party
        shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the relevant Lender or applicable L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority
        evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.


(e)          Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation.


(1)          Each Lender and L/C Issuer shall deliver to each
        Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, when reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Laws or by the taxing authorities of any jurisdiction and
        such other reasonably requested information as will permit such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine (A) whether or not payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document are subject to withholding, (B) if
        applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction, (C) such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable withholding in respect of any payments to be made to such Lender or such L/C
        Issuer by a Loan Party pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (D) whether or not such Lender or such L/C Issuer is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements or otherwise to establish such Lender’s or
        such L/C Issuer’s status for withholding tax purposes in any applicable jurisdiction.


(2)          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,


(i)     each Lender and each L/C Issuer that is
        a U.S. Person shall deliver to Ashland and the Administrative Agent, on or prior to the date on which such “United States person” became a Lender or an L/C Issuer under this Agreement, two duly executed original copies of Internal Revenue Service
        Form W-9; and


(ii)    each Foreign Lender that is entitled
        under the Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of U.S. federal withholding Tax with respect to any payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to Ashland and the Administrative Agent, on or prior to
        the date on which such Foreign Lender or L/C Issuer becomes a Lender or an L/C Issuer under this Agreement, two duly executed original copies of whichever of the following is applicable:


(I)          in the case of a Foreign Lender
        claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to such tax treaty,


(II)          in the case of a Foreign Lender for
        whom any payments under this Agreement constitute income that is effectively connected with such Foreign Lender’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States, IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor thereto),



-68-







(III)          in the case of a Foreign Lender
        that is not the beneficial owner of payments made under this Agreement (including a partnership or a participating Foreign Lender), (1) an IRS Form W-8IMY on behalf of itself and (2) the relevant forms prescribed in clauses (i) and (ii) (I), (II),
        (IV) and (V) of this paragraph (e)(2) that would be required of each such beneficial owners or partners of such partnership if such beneficial owner or partner were a Lender or an L/C Issuer; provided, however, that if such Foreign Lender is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and one or more of its
        partners are claiming the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, such Foreign Lender may provide a Non-Bank Certificate (as described below) on behalf of such partners,


(IV)          in the case of a Foreign Lender
        claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) or Section 871(h) of the Code, (x) a certificate (substantially in the form of Exhibits G-1 through G-4, as applicable (a “Non-Bank Certificate”)) to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of Ashland within the meaning of Section
        881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or (C) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, and that no payments are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of such Foreign Lender, and (y) IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS
        Form W-8BEN-E,


(V)          any other form prescribed by
        applicable Laws or such other evidence satisfactory to Ashland or the Administrative Agent (as applicable) as a basis for claiming any available exemption from or reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax together with such supplementary
        documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit Ashland or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made, and


(VI)          if a payment made to a Foreign
        Lender would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Foreign Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as
        applicable), such Foreign Lender shall deliver to Ashland and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Ashland and the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by
        applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Ashland and the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Ashland and the Administrative Agent to comply
        with its obligations under FATCA, to determine whether such Foreign Lender has complied with such Foreign Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this
        clause (VI), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.


(VII)          Notwithstanding anything to the
        contrary in this Section 3.01(e)(2), in no event will any Lender or L/C Issuer be required to provide any documentation such Lender or L/C Issuer is legally ineligible to
        deliver.


(3)          Each Lender and L/C Issuer shall promptly notify the
        applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any previously delivered form or documentation or any claimed exemption or reduction and provide updated documentation (or promptly
        notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its legal ineligibility to



-69-







do so).  Each Lender and L/C Issuer that has previously delivered any documentation required herein shall, upon the reasonable request of the applicable Borrower or the
      Administrative Agent, deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent additional copies of such documentation (or successor thereto) on or before the date such documentation expires or becomes obsolete or promptly notify the
      applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its legal ineligibility to do so.


(5)          Each Lender and L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the
        Administrative Agent to deliver to the Loan Parties and to any successor Administrative Agent any documentation provided by such Lender or L/C Issuer to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 3.01(e).


(f)          Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund (in cash or applied as an offset against another cash Tax liability)
        of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it
        shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section
            3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest
        (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that such Loan Party, upon the request of the
        Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer, shall repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest, additions to Tax or
        other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental
        Authority and delivers to such Loan Party evidence reasonably satisfactory to such Loan Party of such repayment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (f), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an
        indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise
        to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent,
        any Lender or any L/C Issuer to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.


(g)          Status of Administrative Agent.  Upon execution of this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall deliver to Ashland an accurate, complete, signed copy of IRS Form W-8IMY certifying in Part I that it is a qualified
        intermediary or a U.S. branch and that is assuming primary withholding responsibility for purposes of chapters 3 and 4 of the Code and primary Form 1099 reporting and backup responsibility with respect to payments to it on behalf of a Lender.


3.02        Bifurcation.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent, each of the Borrowers and each of the Lenders acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any of the other
        Loan Documents, the obligations of the Dutch Borrower under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall be several and separate and distinct from the obligations of Ashland and shall be expressly limited to the obligations of the Dutch
        Borrower. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the liability of the Dutch Borrower for the payment and performance of its covenants, representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and the
        other Loan Documents shall be several from but not joint with the obligations of Ashland (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Ashland shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the Dutch Borrower). For the avoidance of
        doubt, the obligations of the Dutch Borrower under the Loan



-70-







Documents are several, and the Dutch Borrower is exclusively liable for its own obligations
        under the Loan Documents.


3.03        Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund
        Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars,
        Euros or Pounds Sterling in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to Ashland through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to
        Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, the applicable Borrower shall,
        upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender or, solely in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, convert such Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to
        Base Rate Loans (without reference to clause (c) of the definition of “Base Rate”), in each case either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or
        immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the applicable Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.


3.04        Inability to Determine Rates.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error),
        or the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with a copy to the Borrowers) that the Required Lenders have determined, that:


(i)          adequate and reasonable means do not
        exist for ascertaining ICE LIBOR for any requested Interest Period, including, without limitation, because the Eurodollar Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or


(ii)          the supervisor for the administrator
        of ICE LIBOR or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which ICE LIBOR shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the interest rate of
        loans (such specific date, the “Scheduled Unavailability Date”),


then, after such determination by the Administrative Agent or receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, as applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers
      may amend this Agreement to replace ICE LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate (including any mathematical or other adjustments to the benchmark (if any) incorporated therein) that has been broadly accepted by the syndicated loan market in the United
      States in lieu of ICE LIBOR (any such proposed rate, a “ICE LIBOR Successor Rate”), together with any proposed ICE LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes (as defined below)
      and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.01, any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the fifth Business Day after the
      Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrowers unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent notice that such Required Lenders do not
      accept such amendment.  For the avoidance of doubt, the ICE LIBOR Successor Rate provided









        for in this Section 3.04 shall not be less than 0%.


If no ICE LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under clause (i) above exist, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain
      Eurodollar Rate Loans (whether denominated in Dollars, Euros or Pound Sterlings) shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required



-71-







Lenders) revokes such notice; provided that any Eurodollar Rate Loan outstanding
      prior to such notice may remain outstanding until the end of the then applicable Interest Period with respect thereto (without giving effect to any subsequent continuation or conversion).  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers may revoke any
      pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request (y) in
      the case of a Borrowing denominated in Euros or Pound Sterlings, for a Borrowing of such alternative currency determined in a customary manner in good faith by the Administrative Agent and (z) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, for a
      Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.


“ICE LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes” means, with respect to any
      proposed ICE LIBOR Successor Rate, any conforming changes to the definition of Base Rate, Interest Period, timing and frequency of determining rates and making payments of interest and other administrative matters as may be appropriate, in the
      discretion of the Administrative Agent, to reflect the adoption of such ICE LIBOR Successor Rate and to permit the administration thereof by the Administrative Agent in a manner substantially consistent with market practice (or, if the Administrative
      Agent determines that adoption of any portion of such market practice is not administratively feasible or that no market practice for the administration of such ICE LIBOR Successor Rate exists, in such other manner of administration as the
      Administrative Agent determines in consultation with the Borrowers).  For the avoidance of doubt, the ICE LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes shall not modify the Applicable Rate without the consent of Ashland.


3.05        Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.


(a)          Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall:


(i)          impose, modify or deem applicable any
        reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.05(e)) or any L/C Issuer;


(ii)          subject any Lender or any L/C Issuer
        to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it (except for Indemnified Taxes indemnifiable under Section 3.01, Other Taxes and Excluded Taxes); or


(iii)          impose on any Lender or any L/C
        Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;


and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to
      make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or such L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the
      amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or such
      L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.



-72-







(b)          Capital Requirements.  If any Lender or any L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s holding company,
        if any, regarding capital requirements or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s holding company, if
        any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender
        or such L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s
        holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity requirements), then from time to time the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
        Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.


(c)          Certificates for Reimbursement.  A certificate of a Lender or an L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified
        in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 3.05 and delivered to Ashland shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within
        10 days after receipt thereof.


(d)          Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section
            3.05 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrowers shall
        not be required to compensate a Lender or an L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.05 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered
        more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies Ashland of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s intention to claim
        compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).


(e)          Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.  The applicable Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurodollar
        funds or deposits, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination
        shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan; provided Ashland shall have received at least 10
        days’ prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender.  If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10
        days from receipt of such notice.


3.06        Compensation for Losses.  Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the applicable Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss,
        cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:


(a)          any continuation, conversion, payment
        or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);



-73-







(b)          any failure by the applicable
        Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by such Borrower; or


(c)          any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate
        Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the applicable Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;


including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from
      which such funds were obtained (but excluding any loss of anticipated profits).  The applicable Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.


For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrowers to the Lenders under this Section









          3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and
      for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.


3.07        Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.


(a)          Designation of a Different Lending Office.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or a Loan Party is required to pay any
        additional amount to any Lender, any L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or any L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender
        gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as applicable, shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending
        Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would
        eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in
        the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the
        case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be.


(b)          Replacement of Lenders.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if a Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to
        any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, Ashland may, at its sole effort and expense, replace such Lender in
        accordance with Section 10.13.


3.08        Survival.  All of the Loan Parties’ obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all
        other Obligations hereunder, and any resignation of the Administrative Agent or assignment by or replacement of a Lender.


ARTICLE IV
CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CREDIT EXTENSIONS


4.01        Conditions of Initial Credit Extension.  The obligation of each L/C Issuer and each Lender to make its initial Credit Extension hereunder is subject to satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with Section 10.01), or substantially concurrent satisfaction, of the following conditions precedent:

-76-







Without limiting the generality of the provisions of the last paragraph of Section
          9.03, for purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in this Section 4.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed
      to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender.


4.02        Conditions to All Credit Extensions.  The obligation of each Lender and each L/C Issuer to honor any Request for Credit Extension (other than a Committed Loan Notice requesting only a conversion of Loans to the other Type
        or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans and except as expressly provided in Section 2.14 with respect to the establishment of, and Credit Extensions under, any Incremental Revolving Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments, and not, for
        the avoidance of doubt, any Credit Extension under an existing Commitment, including, without limitation, a Credit Extension from a Lender which did not increase its Revolving Credit Commitment in the case of a pro-rata draw of all Revolving Credit
        Lenders under a Incremental Revolving Commitment), including on the Closing Date, is subject to the following conditions precedent:


(a)          The representations and warranties of
        each Borrower and each other Loan Party contained in Article V or any other Loan Document, or which are contained in any document furnished at any time under or in
        connection herewith or therewith, shall be true and correct in all material respects (except that any representation and warranty that is qualified as to “materiality” or “Material Adverse Effect” shall be true and correct in all respects) on and
        as of the date of such Credit Extension, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects (except that any representation and

            4.02, the representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.05(a) and (b)

ARTICLE V
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


The Borrowers represent and warrant to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that:


5.01        Existence, Qualification and Power.  Each Loan Party and the Material Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized or formed, legally and validly existing and, as applicable, in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
        incorporation or organization, (b) has all requisite power and authority and all requisite governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals to (i) own or lease its assets and carry on its business and (ii) in the case of such Loan
        Party, execute, deliver and perform its obligations



-77-







under the Loan Documents to which it is a party and consummate the Transactions, and (c) is duly qualified and is licensed and, as applicable, in good standing under the
      Laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification or license; except in each case referred to in clause (b)(i) or (c), to the extent that failure to do so would
 

 decree of any Governmental Authority or any arbitral award to which such Loan Party or its property is subject; or (c) violate, in any material respect, any applicable Law, except with respect to any conflict, breach,
        contravention or payment (but not creation of Liens) referred to in clause (b) to the extent that such conflict, breach, contravention or payment would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


5.03        Governmental Authorization; Other Consents.  On and after the Closing Date, except as already obtained, no approval, consent, exemption, authorization, or other action by, or notice to, or filing with, any Governmental
        Authority or any other Person will be necessary or required in connection with (a) the execution, delivery or performance by, or enforcement against, any Loan Party of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for the consummation of the
        Transactions or (b) the exercise by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of its rights under the Loan Documents, except for those approvals, consents, exemptions, authorizations, actions, notices or filings the failure of which to obtain or make
        would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  As of the Closing Date, all applicable waiting periods in connection with the Transactions have expired without any action having been taken by any Governmental Authority
        restraining, preventing or imposing materially adverse conditions upon the Transactions or the rights of any Loan Party or their respective Subsidiaries freely to transfer or otherwise dispose of, or to create any Lien on, any properties now owned
        or hereafter acquired by any of them.


5.04        Binding Effect.  This Agreement has been, and each other Loan Document, when delivered hereunder, will have been, duly executed and delivered by each Loan Party that is a party thereto.  This Agreement constitutes, and each
        other Loan Document when so de

re are no actions, activities, occurrences, conditions, or incidents that would reasonably be expected to form the basis of such an
        Environmental Claim;


(v)          neither Ashland nor any of its
        Subsidiaries is currently obligated to perform any action or otherwise incur any expense under any Environmental Law pursuant to any Environmental Permit, order, decree, judgment or agreement by which it is bound or has assumed by contract or
        agreement, and none of them is conducting or financing, in whole or in part, any investigation, response or other corrective action pursuant to any Environmental Law at any facility or location; and


(vi)         except as permitted pursuant to Section 7.01, no Lien has been recorded or, to the knowledge of Ashland, threatened, under any Environmental Law with respect to any property or other assets currently owned
        by Ashland or any of its Material Domestic Subsidiaries.


5.10        Insurance.  The properties of each Borrower and the Material Subsidiaries are insured with (i) financially sound and reputable insurance companies and (ii) insurance companies that are not Affiliates of Ashland (other than
        Ashmont Insurance Company, Inc., which is an Affiliate of Ashland, the Subsidiaries of Ashmont Insurance Company, Inc. and their respective successors and assigns), in such amounts, with such deductibles and covering such risks as are customarily
        carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and owning similar properties in localities where such Borrower or the applicable Material Subsidiary operates.


5.11        Taxes.  Each Borrower and each Subsidiary has filed all federal, state and other Tax returns and reports required to be filed, and have paid all federal, state and other Taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental

        the claim in question and for which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance with GAAP, except, where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.  There are
        no proposed Tax assessments or other Tax claims against either Borrower or any Subsidiary that would, if made, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Except as set forth on Schedule 5.11, none of Ashland, the Dutch Borrower or any Domestic Subsidiary is party to any tax sharing agreement, the primary subject of which is Tax, other than any tax
        sharing arrangements solely among the Loan Parties and the Subsidiaries.


5.12        ERISA Compliance.


(a)          Except as would not, either individually or in the
        aggregate, be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Plan is in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Federal or state Laws.  Each Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has
        received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or an application for such a letter is currently being processed by or will be timely filed according to the applicable determination letter cycle with the IRS with respect thereto and, to the
        knowledge of Ashland, nothing has occurred which would prevent, or cause the loss of, such qualification.

e, or, if applicable, accrued, in accordance with applicable generally accepted accounting principles;


(ii)          the fair market value of the assets
        of each funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the
        accrued benefit obligations, as of the Closing Date, with respect to all current and former participants in such Foreign Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to account for such obligations in accordance
        with applicable generally accepted accounting principles; and


(iii)        each Foreign Plan required to be
        registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities.




5.13        Equity Interests; Charter Documents.  All of the outstanding Equity Interests in each Borrower have been validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable.  The copy of the charter of each Borrower and each amendment
        thereto provided pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(iii) is a true and correct copy of such document as of the Closing Date, and is valid and in full force and effect as of the
        Closing Date.


5.14        Margin Regulations; Investment Company Act.

-81-







(b)          None of the Borrowers, any Person Controlling either
        Borrower or any Subsidiary is or is required to be registered as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940.


5.15        Disclosure.  (a)  No report, financial statement, certificate or other written information furnished by or on behalf of either Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the transactions
        contemplated hereby and the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder or under any other Loan Document (in each case as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to
        state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided
        that, with respect to financial estimates, projected or forecasted financial information and other forward-looking information, each Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be
        reasonable at the time of preparation, it being understood that (i) such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as to future events, are not to be viewed as facts, that actual results during the period or periods
        covered by such estimates, projections, forecasts and forward-looking information may differ significantly from the projected or forecasted results and that such differences may be material and that such estimates, projections, forecasts and
        forward-looking information are not a guarantee of financial performance and (ii) no representation or warranty is made with respect to information of a general economic or general industry nature; and (b) as of the Closing Date, the information
        included in the Beneficial Ownership Certification, to the extent provided, is true and correct in all respects.


5.16        Co

here Ashland or any of its Subsidiaries
        conducts business,  the rules and regulations thereunder and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines issued, administered or enforced by any governmental or regulatory agency (collectively, the “Anti-Money Laundering Laws”) and, as of the date hereof, no action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or governmental or regulatory agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving
        Ashland or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Anti-Money Laundering Laws is pending or, to the knowledge of Ashland, threatened.


5.25        Sanctions and Anti-Corruption.  Neither Ashland nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers or employees, nor, to the knowledge of Ashland, any of their respective directors, agents or Affiliates, is a
        Sanctioned Person, nor is Ashland or any of its Subsidiaries located, organized or resident in a country or territory that is a Sanctioned Country; and no Borrower will directly or, knowingly, indirectly use the proceeds of the Credit Extensions
        hereunder to fund or facilitate, or lend, contribute or otherwise make available such proceeds to any Subsidiary to fund or facilitate or to any joint venture partner or other Person that Ashland or any of its Subsidiaries knows will use such
        proceeds to fund or facilitate, (a) any activities of or business with any Person, or in any country or territory, that, at the time of such funding, is the subject or target of Sanctions or (b) any use of such proceeds in any other manner that
        will result in a violation by any Person (including any Person participating in the transaction, whether as Lender, Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer or otherwise) of Sanctions.  Ashland, its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and employees
        and, to the knowledge of Ashland, Ashland’s directors and agents are in compliance with Sanctions in all material respects.


Neither Ashland nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of Ashland, any of its directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates has, in the
      past five years, failed to comply with any provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or any applicable law or regulation implementing the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International
      Business Transactions, or committed an offence under the Bribery Act 2010 of the United Kingdom, or any other applicable Anti-Corruption Laws.  Ashland and its Subsidiaries have instituted, maintain and enforce proce-



-83-







dures designed to promote and ensure compliance with all applicable Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions.


In relation to any Lender that is subject to the regulations referred to below (each, a “Restricted









          Lender”), the covenants, representations and warranties contained in Section 5.25 and 6.16 that refer to Sanctions (each, a “Specified Provision”) shall only apply for the benefit of such Restricted Lender to the extent that such Specified Provision would not result in a violation of, conflict with or
      liability under Council Regulation (EC) No 2271/96, as amended (or any law implementing such regulation in any member state of the European Union or United Kingdom) (the “Mandatory
          Restrictions”). In the event of any consent or direction by Lenders in respect of any Specified Provision of which a Restricted Lender does not have the benefit due to a Mandatory Restriction, then, notwithstanding anything to the
      contrary in the definition of Required Lenders, for so long as such Restricted Lender shall be subject to a Mandatory Restriction, the Commitment and the Fronting Exposure of such Restricted Lender will be disregarded for the purpose of determining
      whether the requisite consent of the Lenders has been obtained or direction by the requisite Lenders has been made, it being agreed, however, that, unless, in connection with any such determination, the Administrative Agent shall have received
      written notice from any Lender stating that such Lender is a Restricted Lender with respect thereto, each Lender shall be presumed, in connection with such determination, not to be a Restricted Lender.

      with the SEC) may be delivered electronically and, if so delivered, shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date (i) on which Ashland posts such documents, or provides a link thereto on Ashland’s public website on the Internet, or (ii) on which

Ashland hereby acknowledges that (a) the Administrative Agent and/or the Arrangers will make available to the Lenders and the L/C Issuers materials
      and/or information provided by or on behalf of Ashland hereunder (collectively, “Borrower Materials”) by posting the Borrower Materials on DebtDomain, Intralinks or another
      similar electronic system (the “Platform”) and (b) certain of the Lenders (each, a “Public Lender”)









      may have personnel who do not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to Ashland or its Affiliates, or the respective securities of any of the foregoing, and who may be engaged in investment and other market-related activities
      with respect to such Persons’ securities.  Ashland hereby agrees that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to identify that portion of the Borrower



-86-







Materials that may be distributed to the Public Lenders and that (w) all such Borrower Materials shall be clearly and conspicuously marked “PUBLIC” which, at a minimum,
      shall mean that the word “PUBLIC” shall appear prominently on the first page thereof; (x) by marking Borrower Materials “PUBLIC,” Ashland shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders to
      treat such Borrower Materials as not containing any material non-public information (although it may be sensitive and proprietary) with respect to Ashland or its securities for purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws (provided, however, that to the extent such Borrower Materials constitute
      Information, they shall be treated as set forth in Section 10.07); (y) all Borrower Materials marked “PUBLIC” are permitted to be made available through a portion of the
      Platform designated “Public Side Information”; and (z) the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers shall be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials that are not marked “PUBLIC” as being suitable only for posting on a portion of the Platform not
      designated “Public Side Information.”

(a)          the occurrence of any Default;


(b)          any matter that has resulted or would
        reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, including (i) breach or non-performance of, or any default under, a Contractual Obligation of Ashland or any Subsidiary; (ii) any dispute, litigation, investigation, proceeding or
        suspension between Ashland or any Subsidiary and any Governmental Authority; or (iii) the commencement of, or any material development in, any litigation or proceeding affecting Ashland or any Subsidiary, including pursuant to any applicable
        Environmental Laws;


(c)          the occurrence of any ERISA Event

(d)          any material change in accounting
        policies or financial reporting practices by Ashland or any Subsidiary thereof, including any determination by Ashland referred to in Section 2.10(b); and

      take with respect thereto.  Each notice pursuant to Section 6.03(a) shall describe with particularity any and all provisions of this Agreement and any other Loan Document
      that have been breached.

      or 7.05; (b) take all reasonable action to maintain all rights, privileges, permits, licenses, approvals and franchises necessary or desirable in the normal conduct of its
      business, except to the extent that failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and (c) maintain, preserve or renew all of its registered and applied for IP Rights, the non-preservation of which would
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


6.06        Maintenance of Properties.


(a)          Maintain, preserve and protect all of its material
        properties and equipment necessary in the operation of its business in good working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted; and


(b)          make all necessary repairs 

o its business or property, except in such instances in which (a) such requirement of Law or order, writ, injunction or decree is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted; or (b) the failure
        to comply therewith would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


6.09        Books and Records.  (a) Maintain proper books of record and account, in which full, true and correct entries in material conformity with GAAP consistently applied shall be made of all financial transactions and matters
        involving the assets and business of Ashland or such Subsidiary, as the case may be; and (b) maintain such books of record and account in material conformity with all applicable requirements of any Governmental Authority having regulatory

        make copies thereof or abstracts therefrom, and to discuss its affairs, finances and accounts with its officers, and independent public accountants, at such reasonable times during normal business hours and reasonable frequency, upon reasonable
        advance notice to Ashland; provided, however, that, excluding any
        such visits and inspections during the continuation of an Event of Default, (x) only the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders may exercise rights under this Section 6.10,
        (y) the first such inspection in each calendar year shall be conducted at the sole expense of Ashland without charge to the Administrative Agent and (z) any additional such inspections in a calendar year after the



-88-







first such inspection in such calendar year shall be conducted at the sole expense of the Administrative Agent without charge to Ashland; provided, further, however, that when an Event of Default exists, the Administrative Agent or any
      Lender (or any of their respective representatives or independent contractors) may do any of the foregoing at the sole expense of Ashland at any time during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to Ashland.  The Administrative
      Agent and the Lenders shall give Ashland the opportunity to participate in any discussions with Ashland’s accountants.


6.11        Use of Proceeds.  Use the proceeds of the Credit Extensions (i) to finance, in part, the Refinancing and the other transactions related thereto, (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions,
        (iii) to provide Letters of Credit and (iv) for ongoing working capital and general corporate purposes not in contravention of any Law or of any Loan Document (including to finance acquisitions permitted under Section 7.03).  The Borrowers will not request any Credit Extensions, and no Borrower shall directly or, knowingly, indirectly use, and Ashland shall procure that its Subsidiaries and its and their
        respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall not directly or, knowingly, indirectly use, the proceeds of any Credit Extensions (a) in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment or giving of

        Sanctioned Country or (c) in any manner that would result in the violation of any Sanctions applicable to any party hereto.


6.12        Compliance with Environmental Laws.  Except where the failure to comply therewith would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, comply, and, to the extent permitted by Law and attainable using
        commercially reaso

onmental Reports.  If an Event of Default is continuing (as provided in Section 8.01(c)) relating to Section 5.09 or Section 6.12, or if the Administrative Agent at any time reasonably believes that there exist
        violations of Environmental Laws by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or that there exist any Environmental Liabilities or Environmental Claims, in each case which could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in
        a Material Adverse Effect, then the following procedure shall be implemented:


(a)          the Administrative Agent shall notify
        Ashland that it intends to seek an environmental audit and/or assessment report meeting the description in subsection (c) below, and shall consult with
        Ashland on the facts and circumstances giving rise to the intent;


(b)          Ashland shall have ten (10) Business
        Days to provide a response to and otherwise consult with the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders;


(c)          if, after the consultation described
        in subsections (a) and (b) above, the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders believe
        it necessary, Ashland shall, at the request of the Required Lenders, provide to the Lenders within 60 days after such request, at the expense of Ashland, an environmental audit and/or assessment report with respect to any such Event of De-



-89-







fault, violation, Environmental Liability, and/or Environmental Claim (“Environmental
          Audit”).  An Environmental Audit may include, where reasonably appropriate, soil, air, surface water and groundwater sampling and testing.  The Environmental Audit shall be prepared by an environmental consulting firm reasonably
      acceptable to the Administrative Agent.  The Environmental Audit will, as relevant, indicate the presence or absence of any such violation, and/or the presence, absence, Release or threat of Release of Hazardous Materials and shall include the
      estimated cost of any compliance, removal, remedial or other action required to correct any such Event of Default, or violation, and/or to address any such Environmental Liability and/or Environmental Claim;


(d)          without limiting the generality of
        the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent determines at any time that a material risk exists that any such audit and/or report will not be provided within the time referred to above, the Administrative Agent may retain an environmental consulting
        firm to prepare such audit and/or report at the expense of Ashland, and Ashland hereby grants and agrees to cause any Subsidiary that owns any real property or facility described in such request to grant at the time of such request to the
        Administrative Agent, the Lenders, such firm and any agents or representatives thereof an irrevocable non-exclusive license, subject to the rights of tenants or other Persons with interests in the applicable real property or facility, to enter onto
        their respective properties or facilities to undertake such an audit and/or assessment; and


(e)          without limiting any term or
        provision of Section 10.07, in implementing the above described procedures, the Administrative Agent and Required Lenders will undertake steps deemed reasonable by them
        under the circumstances to accommodate specific requests by the Loan Parties to maintain as confidential information concerning litigation or regulatory compliance strategy provided to them by the Loan Parties pursuant to this Section 6.13.


6.14        Designation as Senior Debt.  Designate all Obligations as “Designated Senior Indebtedness” (or similar term) under, and defined in, any subordinated indebtedness of the Borrowers.


6.15        Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries.  So long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, at the option of Ashland, designate any Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a
        Subsidiary; provided that (i) in the case of designating a Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, on a Pro Forma Basis, Ashland shall be in compliance
        with Section 7.11(a) for the most recently ended Measurement Period for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 6.01, (ii) the designation of a Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall constitute an Investment by Ashland therein at the date of designation in an amount equal to the net book value
        of Ashland’s Investment in such Subsidiary and, at the time of such designation, the aggregate amount of Investments made as a result of designations of Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.15 shall be subject to compliance with 

ed Subsidiary if it was previously designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary.  Upon the effectiveness of the designation of a Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, such Unrestricted Subsidiary shall for all purposes be deemed not to be a
        “Subsidiary” under and pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, unless and until such time, if ever, as it is re-designated to be a Subsidiary as herein provided.  The re-designation of any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Subsidiary
        shall constitute the incurrence at the time of designation of any Investment, Indebtedness or Liens of such Subsidiary existing at such time; provided that,
        by way of clarification and not limitation, such designation shall not be construed to be an acquisition by Ashland or the Subsidiary that is the parent of such Unrestricted Subsidiary for the purposes of Section 7.03.

(b)          Ashland will maintain in effect and enforce policies and
        procedures designed to ensure compliance by Ashland, its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions.


(c)          No Borrower will directly or indirectly knowingly cause
        or permit any of the funds of any Loan Party that are used to repay the Credit Extensions to be derived from any unlawful activity with the result that the making of the Credit Extensions would be in violation of any Anti-Terrorism Law.


(d)          The covenants contained in this Section 6.16 shall, solely as they relate to the Dutch Borrower and its Subsidiaries, apply only to the extent that such covenants would not result in a violation of Council Regulation (EC) No
        2271/96, as amended (or any implementing law or regulation in any member state of the European Union or the United Kingdom).


6.17        Tax residency.


(a)          The Dutch Borrower is not considered to be a resident of
        any jurisdiction other than The Netherlands for the purposes of any double taxation convention concluded by the Netherlands, for the purposes of the Tax Arrangement for the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Belastingregeling voor het Koninkrijk) or for purposes of the Tax Arrangement for the Country of the Netherlands (Belastingregeling









          voor het land Nederland) and the Dutch Borrower will not change its residency for tax purposes (unless with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent).  The Dutch Borrower does not attribute the Loans, or any other elements in
        relation to this Agreement, to a permanent establishment or permanent representative outside the Netherlands and the Dutch Borrower will not attribute the Loans, or any other elements in relation to this Agreement, to a permanent establishment or
        permanent representative outside the Netherlands (unless with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent).

      L/C Issuer) arising under the Loan Documents and amounts payable under Article III, ratably among them in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Second payable to them;


Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations
      constituting accrued and unpaid Letter of Credit Fees and interest on the Loans, L/C Borrowings and other Obligations arising under the Loan Documents, ratably among the Lenders and the L/C Issuers in proportion to the respective amounts described in
      this clause Third payable to them;

-105-







L/C Issuers, the Hedge Banks, the Foreign Line of Credit Banks, the Guaranteed Letter of Credit Banks and the Cash Management Banks in proportion to the
      respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held by them; and


Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations
      have been indefeasibly paid in full, to Ashland or as otherwise required by Law;


Subject to Section 2.03(c), amounts used to Cash Collateralize the
      aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause Fourth above shall be applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur.  If any
      amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above and, if no Obligations remain
      outstanding, delivered to Ashland.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, Obligations arising under Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements, Guaranteed Foreign Line of Credit Agreements, Guaranteed
      Letter of Credit Agreements and Guaranteed Hedge Agreements shall be excluded from the application described above if the Administrative Agent has not received written notice of such agreements prior to the time of application of the proceeds
      described above, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank, Foreign Line of Credit Bank, Guaranteed Letter of Credit Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be.  Each
      Cash Management Bank, Foreign Line of Credit Bank, Guaranteed Letter of Credit Bank or Hedge Bank not a party to this Agreement that has given the notice contemplated by the preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged and
      accepted the appointment of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of Article IX hereof for itself and its Affiliates as if a “Lender” party hereto.


ARTICLE IX
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT


9.01        Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders and each L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints Scotiabank to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the
        Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The
        provisions of this Article IX (other than Section 9.06) are solely for the benefit of the
        Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers, and neither the Borrowers nor any other Loan Party shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions (other than the rights of the Borrowers set forth in Sections 9.06 and 9.10).


9.02        Rights as a Lender.  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
        Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person
        and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with Ashland or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person
        were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.


9.03        Exculpatory Provisions.  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
        Administrative Agent:



-106-







(a)          shall not be subject to any fiduciary
        or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;


(b)          shall not have any duty to take any
        discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the
        Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that
        the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law;


(c)          shall not, except as expressly set
        forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrowers or any of their respective Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the
        Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity;


(d)          shall not be liable for any action
        taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under
        the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own
        gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by a Borrower, a Lender or an L/C Issuer;
        and


(e)          shall not be responsible for or have
        any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or
        thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability,
        effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article
            IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.


9.04        Reliance by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or
        other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also
        may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of
        a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such L/C Issuer unless
        the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be
        counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.



-107-







9.05        Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the
        Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article IX shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent and shall apply to their respective activities in
        connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.


9.06        Resignation of Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and Ashland.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required
        Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States, and in each case such successor shall require the consent of
        Ashland at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default under Section 8.01(f) (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  If no such
        successor shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on
        behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers, after consultation with Ashland, appoint a successor Administrative Agent from among the Revolving Credit Lenders meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify Ashland and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in
        accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative
        Agent on behalf of the Lender or the L/C Issuers under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (b) all
        payments, communications and determinations provided, to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each applicable Lender and each applicable L/C Issuer directly, until such time as the Required Lenders
        appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section.  Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers,
        privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged
        therefrom as provided above in this Section).  The fees payable by Ashland to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between Ashland and such successor, and the retiring
        Administrative Agent shall cease to be entitled to all such fees upon the effectiveness of its resignation as Administrative Agent.  After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions
        of this Article IX and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such
        retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.


Any resignation by Scotiabank as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender,
      if applicable.  Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer and Swing Line
      Lender, (ii) the retiring L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (iii) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in
      substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such
      Letters of Credit.



-108-







9.07        Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.  Each Lender and each L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related
        Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender and each L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
        reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
        under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.


9.08        No Other Duties, Etc.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent or the Co-Managers listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under
        this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except (i) in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or an L/C Issuer hereunder and (ii) in the case of the Arrangers, as specified in Sections 2.09(b)(i), 4.01(a) and (b), 6.02, 10.04 and 10.16.


9.09        Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of
        whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on either Borrower) shall be
        entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:


(a)          to file and prove a claim for the
        whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations (other than Obligations under Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements, Guaranteed Foreign Line of Credit Agreements,
        Guaranteed Letter of Credit Agreements and Guaranteed Hedge Agreements) that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Administrative
        Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the L/C
        Issuers and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(i) and (j), 2.09 and 10.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and


(b)          to collect and receive any monies or
        other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same in accordance with this Agreement;


and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and
      each L/C Issuer to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, if the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the L/C Issuers, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the
      reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections
          2.09 and 10.04.


Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or
      any L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or any L/C Issuer to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or any L/C
      Issuer or in any such proceeding.



-109-







9.10        Guaranty.  Each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential Cash Management Bank, a potential Hedge Bank, a potential Foreign Line of Credit Bank and a potential Guaranteed Line of Credit Bank) and each of
        the L/C Issuers irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent:


(a)          to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the
        Guaranty, (i) upon termination of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than (A) contingent indemnification obligations and (B) obligations and liabilities under Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements, Guaranteed
        Foreign Line of Credit Agreements, Guaranteed Hedge Agreements or Guaranteed Letter of Credit Agreements) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit (other than Letters of Credit as to which other arrangements satisfactory to the
        Administrative Agent and the applicable L/C Issuers shall have been made) or (ii) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing in accordance with Section 10.01; and


(b)          solely in the case of Ashland Chemco, to release Ashland
        Chemco from its obligations under the Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary of Ashland Global (upon a voluntary liquidation or otherwise);


Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent’s authority to release or
      subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section 9.10.  In
      each case as specified in this Section 9.10, the Administrative Agent will, at Ashland’s expense and upon receipt of any certifications reasonably requested by the
      Administrative Agent in connection therewith, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in
      accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 9.10.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall release from the Lien of any Loan
      Document, without the consent or other action of the Lenders, property of the Loan Parties Disposed in a transaction permitted by the Loan Documents (other than in connection with any Disposition to another Loan Party).


9.11        Withholding.  To the extent required by applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equal to any applicable withholding Tax.  If the IRS or any Governmental Authority
        asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from any amount paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed, or because
        such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent (to the
        extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting or expanding the obligation of the Borrowers to do so) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or
        otherwise, including any penalties, additions to Tax or interest thereon, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses and any out-of-pocket expenses, in each case, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally imposed or
        asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the
        Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Article IX.  The agreements in this Article IX shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any
        assignment of rights by, or the replacement of a Lender, the termination of the Loans and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under this Agreement.  Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative
        Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds



-110-







paid for the account of such Lender.  For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 9.11,
      the term “Lender” includes any L/C Issuer.


9.12        Certain ERISA Matters.


(a) Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person
      became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of either Borrower or any other Loan Party, that at least
      one of the following is and will be true:


(i) such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans with respect to such
      Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments or this Agreement,


(ii) the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as PTE 84-14 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by independent
      qualified professional asset managers), PTE 95-60 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts),
      PTE 91-38 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds) or PTE 96-23 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect to such Lender’s entrance
      into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement,


(iii) (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B) such
      Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf of such Lender to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, (C) the entrance into,
      participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84-14 and (D) to the best knowledge of such
      Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement,
      or


(iv) such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, and such
      Lender.


(b) In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has provided
      another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants,
      from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of either Borrower or any other
      Loan Party, that the Administrative Agent is not a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments
      and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto).



-111-







9.13        Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements, Guaranteed Foreign Line of Credit Agreements, Guaranteed Letter of Credit Agreements and Guaranteed Hedge Agreements.  Except to the extent specifically provided for in Section 10.01, no Cash Management Bank, Foreign Line of Credit Bank, Guaranteed Letter of Credit Bank or Hedge Bank that obtains the benefits of Section 8.03, the Guaranty by virtue of the provisions hereof or of the Guaranty shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any
        other Loan Document other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article









            IX to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Obligations arising under Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements,
        Guaranteed Foreign Line of Credit Agreements, Guaranteed Letter of Credit Agreements and Guaranteed Hedge Agreements unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such agreements prior to the time of application of the proceeds
        described above, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank, Foreign Line of Credit Bank, Guaranteed Letter of Credit Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be.


ARTICLE X
MISCELLANEOUS


10.01      Amendments, Etc.  No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by a Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing
        signed by the Required Lenders and Ashland or the applicable Loan Party, as the case may be, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose
        for which given; provided, however, that no such amendment, waiver
        or consent shall:


(a)          waive any condition set forth in Section 4.01 (other than Section 4.01(b)(i) or (c) and except as expressly set forth in Section 4.01), or, in the case of the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.02, without the written consent of each Lender;


(b)          extend or increase the Commitment or

        Event of Default or mandatory prepayment shall not constitute an extension or increase of any Commitment of any Lender);


(c)          postpone any date fixed by this
        Agreement or any other Loan Document for (i) any payment (excluding mandatory prepayments) of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under such other Loan Document without the written consent of
        each Lender entitled to such payment or (ii) any scheduled reduction of any Facility hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each affected Lender;


(d)          reduce the principal of, or the rate
        of interest specified herein on, any Loan or L/C Borrowing, or (subject to clause (v) of the third proviso to this Section 10.01) any fees or other amounts payable

        Letter of Credit Fees at the Default Rate or (ii) to amend any financial covenant hereunder (or any defined term used therein) even if the effect of such



-112-







amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or L/C Borrowing or to reduce any fee payable hereunder;


(e)          change Section 2.06(c), 2.13 or 8.03 in a manner
        that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender;

        required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (it being understood that, with the consent of the Required Lenders or pursuant
        to Section 2.14, additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the determination of the Required Lenders on substantially the same basis
        as the Term A Loans and the Revolving Credit Commitments on the date hereof); or


(g)          impose any greater restriction on the
        ability of any Lender under a Facility to assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the written consent of each Lender directly adversely affected thereby;


provided that no amendment, waiver or consent shall release all or substantially

      Defaulting Lender) (it being understood that the foregoing shall not negate the authorizations provided by the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.10); and provided,
      further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by Majority in Interest of the Revolving Credit Lenders in addition to the
      Lenders required above, waive or modify any condition precedent to the funding of Revolving Credit Loans set forth in Section 4.02 (it being understood and agreed that any
      amendment or waiver of, or any consent with respect to, any provision of this Agreement (other than any waiver or amendment expressly relating to Section 4.02) or any other
      Loan Document, including any amendment of an affirmative or negative covenant set forth herein or in any other Loan Document or any waiver of a Default or an Event of Default, shall not be deemed to be a waiver or modification of any condition
      precedent to funding of Revolving Credit Loans set forth in Section 4.02), (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the L/C Issuers in
      addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the L/C Issuers under this Agreement or any Issuer Document relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by it; (iii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
      writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (iv) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
      writing and signed by the Swing Line Lender in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Swing Line Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (v) any fee letter entered into in connection with the
      Facility may only be amended, and the rights or privileges thereunder may only be waived, in a writing executed by each of the parties thereto; and (vi) no amendment,
        modification, termination or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents (including the definition of “Cash Management Bank”, “Foreign Line of Credit Bank”, “Foreign Line of Credit Agreement”, “Guaranteed Letter of Credit Bank”, “Hedge Bank”, “Guaranteed Cash Management Agreement”, “Guaranteed Foreign Line of Credit Agreement”, “Guaranteed Letter of Credit Agreement”, “Swap Contract”, “Guaranteed Hedge Agreement”, “Obligations” (as such terms (or terms with similar concepts) are defined in this Agreement or any applicable Loan Document)) shall alter the
        ratable treatment of Obligations arising under the Loan Documents, on the one hand, and Obligations arising under Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements, Guaranteed Foreign Line of Credit Agreements, Guaranteed Letter of Credit Agreements or
      Guaranteed Hedge Agreements, on the other hand, as provided in Section 8.03, in each case in a manner adverse to any such Cash Management Bank, Foreign



-113-







Line of Credit Bank, Guaranteed Letter of Credit Bank, or Hedge Bank that is
      different than the affect of any such amendment, modification, termination or waiver on the other Lenders, without the written consent of such Cash Management
      Bank, Foreign Line of Credit Bank, Guaranteed Letter of Credit Bank, or Hedge Bank, as applicable.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting
      Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of
      the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (x) (i) the Commitment or any Loan of such Lender may not be increased or extended (or reinstated, to the extent terminated pursuant to Section 8.02), (ii) no date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any payment (excluding mandatory prepayments) of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to such Lender may be postponed
      and/or (iii) neither the principal of, nor the rate of interest specified herein on, any Loan or L/C Borrowing, or (subject to clause (v) of the third proviso to this Section 10.01) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan
      Document to such Lender may be reduced, in each case without the consent of such Lender (it being understood that a waiver of any condition precedent set forth in Section 4.01
      or 4.02 or the waiver of any Default, Event of Default or mandatory prepayment shall not constitute an extension or increase of any Commitment of any Lender) and (y) any
      waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.


If any Lender does not consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, consent or release with respect to any Loan Document that requires the consent of each
      Lender and that has been approved by the Required Lenders, Ashland  may replace such non-consenting Lender by an assignment of such Lender’s Loans and Commitments at par in accordance with Section 10.13; provided that such amendment, waiver, consent or release can be effected as a result of the assignment contemplated by
      such Section (together with all other such assignments required by Ashland to be made pursuant to this paragraph).


Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any Loan Document may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified pursuant to an agreement or agreements in
      writing entered into by Ashland and the Administrative Agent (without the consent of any Lender) solely to cure a defect or error.


10.02      Notices; Effectiveness; Electronic Communications.

        pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender or any L/C Issuer pursuant
        to Article II if such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as applicable, has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by
        electronic communication.  The Administrative Agent or Ashland may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.


Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the
      sender’s receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the “return receipt requested” function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement); provided that if such notice or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the n

      notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor.


(c)          The Platform.  THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”  THE AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY
        DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS.  NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS
        OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM.  In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the “Agent Parties”) have any liability to either Borrower, any Lender, any L/C Issuer or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether
        in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of either Borrower’s or the Administrative Agent’s transmission of Borrower Materials through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined
        by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided,
        however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to either Borrower, any Lender, any L/C Issuer or any other Person for indirect, special,
        incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages).


(d)          Change of Address, Etc.  Each of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent may change its address, telecopier number, telephone number or email address for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other
        parties hereto.  Each other Lender, each L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender may change its address, telecopier number, telephone number or email address for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to Ashland and the Administrative
        Agent.  In addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record (i) an effective address, contact name, telephone number, telecopier number and electronic mail
        address to which notices and other communications may be sent and (ii) accurate wire



-115-







instructions for such Lender.  Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected
      the “Private Side Information” or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lender’s compliance procedures and applicable Law, including
      United States Federal and state securities Laws, to make reference to Borrower Materials that are not made available through the “Public Side Information” portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information with respect to
      Ashland or its securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws.


(e)          Reliance by Administrative Agent, L/C Issuers and Lenders.  The Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including telephonic Committed Loan Notices and Swing
        Line Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of either Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the
        terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof.  All telephonic notices to and other telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties
        hereto hereby consents to such recording.


10.03      No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies; Enforcement.  No failure by any Lender, any L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder
        or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
        remedy, power or privilege.  The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan Document, are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.


Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under
      the other Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in
      accordance with Section 8.02 for the benefit of all the Lenders and the L/C Issuers; provided,
      however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit
      (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (b) any L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as L/C Issuer or
      Swing Line Lender, as the case may be) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (c) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 10.08 (subject
      to the terms of Section 2.13), or (d) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding
      relative to any Loan Party under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided, further,
      that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 2.13, any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders.


10.04      Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.


(a)          Costs and Expenses.  Ashland shall pay (i) all reasonable and invoiced out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Arrangers and Administrative Agent and their respective Affiliates (including the reasonable fees, charges and
        disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent), in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery



-116-

      transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable and invoiced out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any L/C Issuer in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any
      demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all reasonable and invoiced out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent,
      any Lender or any L/C Issuer) in connection with the enforcement, during an Event of Default, or protection of its rights (A) in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section 10.04, or (B) in connection with Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such reasonable and invoiced out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout,
      restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.


(b)          Indemnification by Ashland.  Ashland shall indemnify the Arrangers, the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Lender and each L/C Issuer, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such
        Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the
        fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for any Indemnitee, which shall be limited to one counsel to all Indemnitees (exclusive of one local counsel to all Indemnitees in each relevant jurisdiction) and, in the case of an actual or perceived
        conflict of interest where the Indemnitee affected by such conflict informs Ashland of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel, another counsel for such affected Indemnitee), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any
        Indemnitee by any third party or by Ashland or any other Loan Party arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or
        thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof)
        and its Related Parties only, the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by any L/C Issuer to honor a demand for
        payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence, Release, or threat of Release of Hazardous Materials
        at, on, under or from any property or facility owned or operated by Ashland or any of its Subsidiaries, or any other Environmental Liability related in any way to Ashland or any of its Subsidiaries or (iv) any actual or prospective claim,
        litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by either Borrower or any other Loan Party or any of the Borrowers’ or such Loan
        Party’s respective directors, shareholders or creditors, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not,
        as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross
        negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or such Indemnitee’s Subsidiaries or the officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives of such Indemnitee or its Subsidiaries, (y) result from a claim brought by
        either Borrower or any other Loan Party against an Indemnitee for material breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee’s obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if either Borrower or any such Loan Party has obtained a final and
        nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or (z) resulted from any proceeding that does not involve an act or omission by Ashland or any of its Affiliates and that is brought by an
        Indemnitee against any other Indemnitee other than any proceeding by or against any Indemnitee in its capacity or in fulfilling its role as the Administrative Agent or an Arranger.


(c)          Reimbursement by Lenders.  To the extent that Ashland for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to any Arranger,



-117-







the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), any L/C Issuer or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Arranger, the
      Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), such L/C Issuer or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such
      unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or
      asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or any L/C Issuer in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or L/C Issuer in connection
      with such capacity.  The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.12(d).


(d)          Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no party hereto shall assert, and each party hereto hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee or any Loan Party (or any of its
        Related Parties), on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with or as a result of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
        agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof;
          provided that nothing in this sentence shall limit the obligations of Ashland set forth in Section 10.04(b) in respect of any such damages owing by any
        Indemnitee to a third party.  No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any
        information or other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the
        transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent
        jurisdiction.


(e)          Payments.  All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten Business Days after demand therefor.


(f)          Survival.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, any L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and
        the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.


10.05      Payments Set Aside.  To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of either Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises
        its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
        Administrative Agent, such L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the
        obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and (b) each Lender and each L/C Issuer severally agrees to
        pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a
        rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.  The obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of
        this Agreement.

10.06      Successors and Assigns.


(a)          Successors and Assigns Generally.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that neither the
        Borrowers nor any other Loan Parties may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its
        rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.06(b), (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the
        provisions of Section 10.06(d), or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of Section 10.06(f) (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other
        than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section 10.06 and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or
        claim under or by reason of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any assignment of any Revolving Credit Loans will be ratable among any outstanding Borrowings of Revolving Credit Loans, including as between the Obligations of Ashland and the
        Dutch Borrower.


(b)          Assignments by Lenders.  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment(s) and the Loans
        (including for purposes of this Section 10.06(b), participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing Line Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:


(i)          Minimum Amounts.


(A)          in the case of an assignment of the
        entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment under any Facility and the Loans at the time owing to it under such Facility or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount
        need be assigned; and


(B)          in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section 10.06, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for
        this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and
        Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if a “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000, in the case of any assignment in
        respect of the Revolving Credit Facility or $1,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of the Term A Facility, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Ashland otherwise
        consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be
        treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met;


(ii)          Proportionate Amounts.  Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under any Facility with respect to the
        Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not apply to the



-119-







Swing Line Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of the Swing Line Loans; provided that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Facilities on a non pro rata basis;


(iii)          Required Consents.  No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B)
        of this Section and, in addition:


(A)          the consent of Ashland  (such consent
        not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that Ashland will be deemed to have consented to any such assignment if it does not respond within ten
        Business Days after receipt of notice of such assignment) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment, (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved
        Fund or (3) such assignment is made by an Arranger during the primary syndication of the Facilities;


(B)          the consent of the Administrative
        Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of (1) any Term A Commitment, Revolving Credit Commitment or Revolving Credit Loans if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender
        with a Commitment in respect of the applicable Facility, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender or (2) any Term A Loan to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; and


(C)          the consent of the Swing Line Lender
        and each L/C Issuer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that the Swing Line Lender and each L/C Issuer will be deemed to have
        consented to any such assignment if it does not respond within ten Business Days after receipt of notice of such assignment) shall be required for any assignment in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility.


(iv)          Assignment and Assumption.  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the
        amount of $3,500; and provided, further, that the Administrative
        Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment.  The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.


(v)          No Assignment to Ashland.  No such assignment shall be made to Ashland or any of Ashland’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.06(h).


(vi)          No Assignment to Natural Persons or Defaulting Lenders.  No such assignment shall be made (A) to a natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the
        primary benefit of, a natural person) or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Affiliates, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (A) or (B).


(vii)          Certain Additional Payments.  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to
        the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment,
        purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding,



-120-







with the consent of Ashland and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting
      Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest
      accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
      that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a
      Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.


(viii)      No Assignment to the Public.  If the assignment relates to Commitments and the Loans provided to the Dutch Borrower, no such assignment shall be made to a Person that forms part of the “Public” as
        interpreted under CRR by the relevant authority or authorities.


Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c)
      of this Section 10.06, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the
      extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption,
      be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall
      continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender shall constitute a waiver or release
      of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.  Upon request, the applicable Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender
      of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 10.06(d).


(c)          Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register
        for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal and interest amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose
        name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information
        regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender.  The Register shall be available for inspection by any Loan Party and any Lender (with respect to such Lender’s interest only), at any reasonable time
        and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.


(d)          Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, a Defaulting Lender or a Borrower
        or any of Ashland’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all
        or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender’s participations in L/C Obligations and/or



-121-







Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under
      this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers shall
      continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender
      shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that
      such agreement or instrument may, as may be agreed between such Lender and such Participant, provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first
      proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant.  Subject to subsection (e) of this
      Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04
      and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section
          3.01(e) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered solely to the participating Lender)) to the same extent
      as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 10.06(b); provided that such Participant complies with the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 10.13
      as if it were an assignee under Section 10.06(b).  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08
      as though it were a Lender; provided such Participant complies with Section 2.13
      as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Ashland, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal and
      interest amounts of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other Obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information
      relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, or its other obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, or other obligation is in registered form
      under Section 5f.103-(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations or, if different, under Sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code in connection with any Tax audit or other Tax proceeding of a Borrower.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be
      conclusive, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.


(e)          Limitations upon Participant Rights.  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent such entitlement to
        receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the date such Participant acquired the applicable participation.


(f)          Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including
        any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no such
        pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.


(g)          Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender after Assignment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if Scotiabank assigns all of its Revolving Credit Commitment and Revolving Credit Loans pursuant
        to Section 10.06(b), Scotiabank may, upon 30 days’ notice to Ashland and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender.  In the event of any such resignation
        as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, Ashland shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by Ashland to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Scotiabank as L/C Issuer and/or



-122-







Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, and no such appointment shall be effective until the Lender so appointed shall have accepted such appointment in writing.  If
      Scotiabank resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C
      Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). 









      If Scotiabank resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right
      to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c).  Upon the appointment of a successor
      L/C Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, and (b) the successor L/C Issuer
      shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to such retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of such retiring L/C
      Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit.


(h)          Any Lender may, so long as no Default or Event of
        Default has occurred and is continuing, at any time, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations with respect to Term A Loans to Ashland or any Subsidiary through (x) Dutch auctions or other offers to purchase open to all Lenders on a pro
        rata basis, in each case, in accordance with procedures reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent or (y) open market purchases on a non-pro rata basis; provided









        that:


(i)          (x) if the assignee is a Subsidiary,
        upon such assignment, transfer or contribution, the applicable assignee shall automatically be deemed to have transferred the principal amount of such Term A Loans, plus
        all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to Ashland or (y) if the assignee is Ashland (including through transfers set forth in clause (x)), (a) the principal amount of such Term A Loans, along with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, so
        contributed, assigned or transferred to Ashland shall be deemed automatically cancelled and extinguished on the date of such contribution, assignment or transfer, (b) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Term A Loans of the remaining
        Lenders shall reflect such cancellation and extinguishing of the Term A Loans then held by Ashland and (c) Ashland shall promptly provide notice to the Administrative Agent of such contribution, assignment or transfer of such Term A Loans, and the
        Administrative Agent, upon receipt of such notice, shall reflect the cancellation of the applicable Term A Loans in the Register;


(ii)          each Person that purchases any Term
        A Loans pursuant to clause (x) of this subsection (h) shall represent and warrant to the selling Term A Lender that it does not possess material non-public information with respect to Ashland and the Subsidiaries that either (1) has not been
        disclosed to the Term A Lenders generally (other than Term A Lenders that have elected not to receive such information) or (2) if not disclosed to the Term A Lenders, would reasonably be expected to have a material effect on, or otherwise be
        material to (A) a Term A Lender’s decision to participate in any such assignment or (B) the market price of such Term A Loans, or shall make a statement that such representation cannot be made, in each case, with respect to any Term A Lender,
        except to the extent that such Term A Lender has entered into a customary “big boy” letter with Ashland; and


(iii)          purchases of Term A Loans pursuant
        to this subsection (h) may not be funded with the proceeds of Revolving Credit Loans.


10.07     Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality.  Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below),



-123-







except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the
      confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential, and the Administrative Agent, the applicable Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, shall be responsible for compliance by such Persons
      with such obligations), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required
      by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; provided that the Person that discloses any Information pursuant to this clause
      (c) shall notify Ashland in advance of such disclosure (if permitted by applicable Law or legal process) or shall provide Ashland with prompt written notice of such disclosure, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any
      remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions
      substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its
      advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to a Borrower and its obligations, insurers and/or risk protection providers, (g) with the written consent of Ashland or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other
      than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than Ashland. In addition, the
      Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent or
      any of the Lenders in connection with the administration or servicing of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Commitments.


For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received
      from any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof relating to any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof or their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer on a
      nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof; provided that, in the case of information received from any Loan Party
      or any Subsidiary thereof after the Closing Date, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to
      have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.


Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information
      concerning Ashland or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law,
      including United States Federal and state securities Laws.


10.08      Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, each L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest
        extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such
        Lender, such L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrowers against any and all of the obligations of the Borrowers now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or
        such L/C Issuer, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or such L/C Issuer shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrowers



-124-







may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or such L/C Issuer different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on
      such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any
        Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.15 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds
        and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such
        Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.  The rights of each Lender, each L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
      that such Lender, such L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have.  Each Lender and each L/C Issuer agrees to notify Ashland and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.


10.09      Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest
        permitted by applicable Law (the “Maximum Rate”).  If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess
        interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrowers.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the
        Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof and (c)
        amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.


10.10      Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken
        together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral
        or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken
        together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or other electronic imaging means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
        counterpart of this Agreement.


10.11      Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith
        shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.  Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any
        Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any
        other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.


10.12      Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and
        the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provi-



-125-







sions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.  The invalidity of a
      provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section









          10.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or
      the Swing Line Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.


10.13      Replacement of Lenders.  If (w) any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, (x) either Borrower is required to pay any additional amount
        to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, (y) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (z) any other circumstance
        exists hereunder that gives Ashland the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then Ashland may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
        recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06; provided that the consent of the assigning Lender shall not be required in connection with any such assignment and delegation), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related
        Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:


(a)          Ashland shall have paid to the
        Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.06(b);


(b)          such Lender shall have received
        payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.01, Section 3.04, or Section









            3.05);


(c)          in the case of any such assignment
        resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section









            3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and


(d)          such assignment does not conflict
        with applicable Laws.
 

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
      circumstances entitling Ashland to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.


10.14      Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc. (a) GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE
        OF NEW YORK.


(b)          SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.  EACH BORROWER IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY, TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN NEW YORK COUNTY AND OF THE
        UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND ANY APPELLATE COURT FROM ANY THEREOF, IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR FOR RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF
        ANY JUDGMENT, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE HEARD AND DE-



-126-







TERMINED IN SUCH NEW YOR

D HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
        OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
        AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.


10.16      No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility.  In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan
        Document), Ashland acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates’ understanding, that:  (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders are
        arm’s-length commercial transactions between Ashland and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders, on the other hand, (B) Ashland has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax
        advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate and (C) Ashland is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan



-127-







Documents; (ii) (A) the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders each is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by
      the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for Ashland or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) neither the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers nor any Lender has any obligation
      to Ashland or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Lenders and their
      respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of Ashland and its Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers nor any Lender has any obligation to disclose any
      of such interests to any Ashland or its Affiliates.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, Ashland hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders with respect to any breach or
      alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.


10.17      Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents.  The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption or in any amendment or other modification hereof
        (including waivers and consents) shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use
        of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and
        Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.


10.18      USA PATRIOT Act.  Each Lender that is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA
        PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of each Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent,
        as applicable, to identify each Loan Party in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act.  The Borrowers shall, promptly following a request by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all documentation and other information that the Administrative
        Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act.


10.19      Currency Indemnity for Judgments..  If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court in any jurisdiction with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, it becomes necessary to convert into a particular
        currency (the “Judgment Currency”) any amount due under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document in any currency other than the Judgment Currency (the “Currency Due”), then conversion shall be that at which in accordance with the normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such
        other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  In the event that there is a change in such exchange rate prevailing between the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which the judgment is given and the
        date of receipt by the applicable Lender or L/C Issuer of the amount due, the applicable Loan Party shall, on the date of receipt by such Lender or L/C Issuer, pay such additional amounts, if any, or be entitled to receive reimbursement of such
        amount, if any, as may be necessary to ensure that the amount received by such Lender or L/C Issuer on such date is the amount in the Judgment Currency which when converted at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of receipt by such Lender or L/C Issuer is the amount then due under this Agreement or such other Loan Document in the Currency Due. If the amount of the Currency Due which the
        applicable Lender or L/C Issuer  is so able to purchase is less than the amount of the Currency Due originally due to it, the applicable Loan Party shall, as a separate obligation



-128-







and notwithstanding any such judgement, indemnify and save such Lender or L/C Issuer harmless from and against all loss or damage arising as a result of such deficiency.


10.20      Acknowledgment and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party
        hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and
        consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:


(a)          the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers
        by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and the
          effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:


(i)          a reduc

ansfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regimes if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a
        state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such
        Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regimes if the Supported QFC
        and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the par-



-129-







ties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.


(b)          As used in this Section 10.21, the following terms have the following meanings:


“BHC Act Affiliate” of a party means an “affiliate” (as
      such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.
