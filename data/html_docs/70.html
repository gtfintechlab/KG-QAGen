liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund or
maintain LIBOR Loans) that such Lender may incur or sustain (i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender) a
Borrowing or continuation of a LIBOR Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing, (ii) if any
repayment, prepayment or conversion of any LIBOR Loan occurs on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period
applicable thereto (including as a consequence of any assignment made pursuant to <b>Section 2.17(a)</b> or any acceleration
of the maturity of the Loans pursuant to <b>Section 8.2</b>), (iii) if any prepayment of any LIBOR Loan is not made on any
date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the Borrower or (iv) as a consequence of any other failure by the Borrower
to make any payments with respect to any LIBOR Loan when due hereunder. Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under
this <b>Section 2.16</b> shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded its relevant LIBOR Loan through the purchase
of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such LIBOR Loan, having a
maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that each Lender may fund its
LIBOR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts
payable under this <b>Section 2.16</b>. A certificate (which shall be in reasonable detail) showing the bases for the
determinations set forth in this <b>Section 2.16</b> by any Lender as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this <b>Section
2.16 </b>shall be submitted by such Lender to the Borrower either directly or through the Administrative Agent.
Determinations set forth in any such certificate made in good faith for purposes of this <b>Section 2.16</b> of any such
losses, expenses or liabilities shall be conclusive absent manifest error.</p>

The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for all drawings under a Letter of Credit (a “<u>Reimbursement
Obligation</u>”) shall be governed by the Application related to such Letter of Credit and this Agreement, except that reimbursement
shall be paid by no later than 12:00 Noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date which each drawing is to be paid if the
Borrower has been informed of such drawing by the L/C Issuer on or before 11:30 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date
when such drawing is to be paid or, if notice of such drawing is given to the Borrower after 11:30 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina
time) on the date when such drawing is to be paid, by the end of such day, in all instances in immediately available funds at
such office as the Administrative Agent may designate in writing to the Borrower, and the Administrative Agent shall thereafter
cause to be distributed to the L/C Issuer such amount(s) in like funds. If the Borrower does not make any such reimbursement payment
on the date due and the Lenders fund their participations in the manner set forth in <b>Section 2.21(d) </b>below, then all payments
thereafter received by the Administrative Agent in discharge of any of the relevant Reimbursement Obligations shall be distributed
in accordance with <b>Section 2.21(d)</b> below. In addition, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and
each Lender, the Borrower agrees that, notwithstanding any provision of any Application, its obligations under this <b>Section
2.21(c) </b>and each Application shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the relevant Application, under all circumstances whatsoever, and irrespective of any claim
or defense that the Borrower may otherwise have against the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender, including (i)
any lack of validity or enforceability of any Credit Document; (ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from
all or any of the provisions of any Credit Document; (iii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense, or other right of the
Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary of a Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom a beneficiary may be acting),
the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, another Credit
Document, the transactions related to the Credit Documents or any unrelated transaction; (iv) any statement or any other document
presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein
being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (v) payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit against presentation to the
L/C Issuer of a draft or certificate that does not comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit, or (vi) any other act or omission
to act or delay of any kind by the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, any Lender or any other Person or any other event or
circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this <b>Section 2.21(c)</b>, constitute a legal or equitable discharge
of the Borrower’s obligations hereunder or under an Application. None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the L/C
Issuer shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of
Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding
sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication
under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation
of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the L/C Issuer; <u>provided</u> that the foregoing
shall not be construed to excuse the L/C Issuer from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed
to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower and each other Credit Party to the extent
permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the L/C Issuer’s failure to exercise care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto
expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the L/C Issuer (as determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment), the L/C Issuer shall be deemed to have exercised care
in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that,
with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit,
the L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents
if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.</p>

and (ii) from the date two Business Days after the date such payment is due from such Lender to the date such payment is made
by such Lender, the Base Rate in effect for each such day. Each such Lender shall, after making its appropriate payment, be
entitled to receive its Applicable Percentage of each payment received in respect of the relevant Reimbursement Obligation
and of interest paid thereon, with the L/C Issuer retaining its Applicable Percentage thereof as a Lender hereunder. The
several obligations of the Lenders to the L/C Issuer under this <b>Section 2.21</b> shall be absolute, irrevocable and
unconditional under any and all circumstances and shall not be subject to any set off, counterclaim or defense to payment
which any Lender may have or has had against the Borrower, the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or any

issued prior to such reduction or termination), and each payment by a Lender under this <b>Section 2.21 </b>shall be made

Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable in its sole and absolute discretion, including at prices and on terms
that might be less favorable than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions (including a public
offering made pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act), and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees

price that might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations, even

separate action or actions may be brought against each Guarantor whether or not any action is brought against the Borrower or
any other Guarantor and whether or not the Borrower or any other Guarantor is joined in any such action. Each Guarantor
agrees that to the extent all or part of any payment of the Guaranteed Obligations made by any Person is subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid by or on behalf of any Guaranteed
Party to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any Debtor Relief Laws (the amount of any such payment, a
“<u>Reclaimed Amount</u>”), then, to the extent of such Reclaimed Amount, this Guaranty shall continue in full
force and effect or be revived and reinstated, as the case may be, as to the Guaranteed Obligations intended to be satisfied
as if such payment had not been received; and each Guarantor acknowledges that the term “Guaranteed Obligations”
includes all Reclaimed Amounts that may arise from time to time.</font></p>
