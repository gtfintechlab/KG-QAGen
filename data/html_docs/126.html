thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the higher of (A) the interest rate applicable at the time to the

any Note to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant governmental authority in accordance
with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by such Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to
