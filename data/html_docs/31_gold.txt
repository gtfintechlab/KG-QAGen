      The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount and Class of each Revolving Loan made hereunder, the Agreed Currency and Type thereof and the Interest Period with
respect thereto, (ii) the amount of each Foreign Currency Swing Loan made hereunder and the Appropriate Foreign Currency with respect thereto, (iii) the amount of each Euro Swing Loan made hereunder, (iv) the amount of each U.S. Swing
Loan made hereunder, (v) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from any Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (vi) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from any
Borrower and each Lenders share thereof.  (c)       Absent manifest error, the
entries in the accounts maintained pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided that the failure of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms. In the event of any conflict between
the accounts maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts of any Lender, the accounts of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.

364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement


(d)     Any Revolving Lender may request that its Loans be
evidenced by a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit E (a Note). In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Revolving Lender such Note payable to such Revolving Lender. Thereafter,
the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after any assignment pursuant to Section 13.3) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the payee named therein or any assignee pursuant to
Section 13.3, except to the extent that any such Revolving Lender or assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in clauses (a) and
(b) above.  2.19     Telephonic Notices.   Each Borrower hereby
authorizes the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to convert or continue Revolving Advances based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Administrative Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be an Authorized Officer, it
being understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Conversion/Continuation Notices to be given telephonically by an Authorized Officer. The applicable Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent
or the applicable Lender a written confirmation (signed by an Authorized Officer) of each telephonic notice, if such confirmation is requested by the Administrative Agent or such Lender. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect
from the action taken by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender in accordance with the telephonic notice of the applicable Borrower, the records of the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall govern absent manifest error. 
2.20     Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis.   Interest accrued on each Base Rate
Advance shall be payable by the applicable Borrower on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which such Base Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, and at
maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal amount of any Base Rate Advance converted into a Eurocurrency Advance on a day other than a Payment Date shall be payable by the applicable Borrower on the date of conversion.
Interest accrued on each Eurocurrency Advance shall be payable by the applicable Borrower on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which such Eurocurrency Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at
maturity. Interest accrued on each Eurocurrency Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable by the applicable Borrower on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period. Interest accrued on
each Foreign Currency Swing Loan, on each Euro Swing Loan and on each U.S. Swing Loan shall be paid by the applicable Borrower on the Maturity Date therefor and on any date on which such Foreign Currency Swing Loan, such Euro Swing Loan or such U.S.
Swing Loan is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise. Interest and commitment fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year, except for interest on Base Rate Loans calculated by reference to the
prime rate of Bank of America and Foreign Currency Swing Loans and Revolving Loans denominated in Pounds Sterling, as applicable, which shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365-day year or when appropriate, a
366-day year. Interest shall be payable by the applicable Borrower for the day a Loan is made but not for the day of any

364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on a Loan shall become due on a day which is not a
Business Day, such payment shall be made by the applicable Borrower on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.
 2.21     Notification of Revolving Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment
Reductions.   Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each applicable Lender of the contents of each Total Commitment reduction notice, Revolving Advance Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice and
repayment or prepayment notice received by it hereunder. The Administrative Agent will notify each applicable Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Eurocurrency Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each
Lender prompt notice of each change in the Base Rate.  2.22     Lending Installations.
  Each Lender may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers in accordance with Article XIV, or the Administrative Agent, may by written notice to the Borrowers and the Lenders, designate replacement or
additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made available by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued
hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation.  2.23
    Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.   (a)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender on (in the case of a Base Rate Advance) or prior to (in the case of
a Eurocurrency Advance) the proposed date of any Revolving Advance that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Revolving Advance, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made
such share available on such date in accordance with Sections 2.1 and 2.2, as applicable, and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made
its share of the applicable Revolving Advance available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day
Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender,
the Compensation Rate and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the Base Rate. If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative
Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Revolving Advance to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute
such Lenders Loan included in such Revolving Advance. Any payment by such Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
 (b)     Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the applicable Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the 
 









 
39
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.
In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in Same Day Funds with interest thereon,
for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Compensation Rate. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or such Borrower with respect to
any amount owing under this clause (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  2.24
    Participations in Swing Loans.   (a)  Each Multi-Currency Revolving Lender agrees that it shall at all times have a participation in, and acknowledges that it is irrevocably and unconditionally
obligated, upon receipt of notice that the Administrative Agent has received a Swing Funding Notice for any Euro Swing Loan or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, to fund (or to cause an Affiliate to fund) its participation in, such outstanding Euro Swing
Loan or Foreign Currency Swing Loan in an amount equal to its Multi-Currency Pro Rata Share (or such greater share as may be determined pursuant to Section 2.29(a)(iv)) of the amount of such Euro Swing Loan or Foreign Currency Swing Loan. Each
Revolving Lender agrees that it shall at all times have a participation in, and acknowledges that it is irrevocably and unconditionally, upon receipt of notice that the Administrative Agent has received a Swing Funding Notice for any U.S. Swing
Loan, required to fund (or to cause an Affiliate to fund) its participation in, such outstanding U.S. Swing Loan in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share (or such greater share as may be determined pursuant to Section 2.29(a)(iv)) of the amount
of such U.S. Swing Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate Total Outstandings held by any Lender (whether directly or by participation) shall not exceed such Lenders Multi-Currency Revolving Commitment or Dollar Revolving
Commitment, as the case may be.  (b)     The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
applicable Revolving Lender of its receipt of a Swing Funding Notice. Promptly (and in any event within one Business Day in the case of U.S. Swing Loans and three Business Days in the case of Foreign Currency Swing Loans or Euro Swing Loans) after
receipt of such Notice, each applicable Revolving Lender shall (or shall cause an Affiliate to) make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of each applicable Swing Lender an amount in the applicable Agreed Currency and in Same Day
Funds equal to its applicable share of all outstanding Swing Loans of such Swing Lender (it being understood that no Revolving Lender which is an Affiliate of a Swing Lender shall be obligated to make any amount available to such Swing Lender unless
otherwise required by such Swing Lender). If any Revolving Lender so notified fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Swing Lender the full amount of such Revolving Lenders participations in all
Swing Loans of such Swing Lender by the date which is one Business Day (or, in the case of Foreign Currency Swing Loans or Euro Swing Loans, three Business Days) after its receipt of such notice from the Administrative Agent, then interest shall
accrue on such Revolving Lenders obligations to fund such participations, from such date to the date such Revolving Lender pays such obligations in full, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to each relevant Loan as in
effect from time to time during such period.

(c)     From and after the date on which the Administrative Agent
has received a Swing Funding Notice for any Swing Loan, all funds received by a Swing Lender in payment of any Swing Loan made by such Swing Lender, interest accrued thereon after the first (or, in the case of a Foreign Currency Swing Loan or Euro
Swing Loan, third) Business Day following delivery of such notice and other amounts payable in respect thereof shall be delivered by such Swing Lender to the Administrative Agent, in the same funds as those received by such Swing Lender, to be
distributed to all applicable Revolving Lenders in accordance with their applicable shares (i.e., giving effect to the funding of participations pursuant to this Section 2.24), except that the applicable share of such funds of any applicable
Revolving Lender that has not funded its participations as provided herein shall be retained by such Swing Lender.  (d)
    If the Administrative Agent or any Swing Lender is required at any time to return to any Borrower, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator or custodian or any official in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, any portion of
any payment made by such Borrower to the Administrative Agent or such Swing Lender in respect of any Swing Loan or any interest thereon, each applicable Revolving Lender shall, on demand of the Administrative Agent, forthwith return to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Swing Lender its applicable share of the amount so returned by the Administrative Agent or such Swing Lender plus interest thereon from the date such demand is made to the date such amount is returned by
such Revolving Lender to the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the rate specified by such Swing Lender as its cost of funds for such period.  (e)     The Required Lenders, the Swing Lenders and the Administrative Agent may agree on any other reasonable method (such as making assignments of Swing Loans) for sharing the risks of Swing
Loans ratably among all applicable Revolving Lenders as provided herein so long as such method does not materially disadvantage any Lender.  (f)     Each applicable Revolving Lenders obligation to purchase participation interests in Swing Loans pursuant to this Section 2.24 shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not
be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including (a) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may have against any other Lender, any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Person
for any reason whatsoever, (b) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, an Event of Default or a Material Adverse Effect, (c) any breach of this Agreement by any Borrower or any other Lender, (d) any inability of any Borrower to
satisfy the conditions precedent to borrowing set forth in this Agreement on the date upon which any participation interest in any Swing Loan is to be purchased or (e) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing.  (g)     Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (f)
above, no Revolving Lender shall be required to purchase a participation interest in any Swing Loan if, prior to the making of such Swing Loan, the applicable Swing Lender received written notice from the applicable Borrower, the Administrative
Agent or the Required Lenders specifying that one or more of the conditions precedent to the making of such Swing Loan were not satisfied and, in fact, such conditions precedent to the making of such Swing Loan were not satisfied at the time of the
making of such Swing Loan; provided that the obligation of such Revolving Lender to purchase such participation interest shall be reinstated on the date on which all conditions precedent to the making of such Swing Loan have been satisfied (or
waived by the Required Lenders or all Revolving Lenders, as applicable).

2.25     [Intentionally Omitted]. 
2.26     Judgment Currency.   If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is
necessary to convert a sum due from any Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the specified currency) into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so,
that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agents main New York office on the
Business Day preceding that on which final, nonappealable judgment is given. The obligations of the applicable Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency
other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due
to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, such Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such
Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the
specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 12.2, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agrees
to remit such excess to such Borrower.  2.27     Increase in Commitments. 
(a)     Provided there exists no Default or Event of Default, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which
shall promptly notify such of the Revolving Lenders as the Borrowers may specify), the Borrowers may, from time to time, elect to increase the Total Commitment to an amount (after giving effect to all such increases) that does not exceed
U.S.$5,000,000,000; provided that (i) each increase shall be in a minimum amount of U.S.$25,000,000 and (ii) the Borrowers may make a maximum of five such elections. At the time of sending such notice, the Borrowers (in consultation
with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each applicable Revolving Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the applicable
Revolving Lenders).  (b)     Each applicable Revolving Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent
within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, the amount of such increase and whether such increase is of its Dollar Revolving Commitment or Multi-Currency Revolving Commitment. Any Revolving Lender not
responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Revolving Commitment. 
 









 
42
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement


(c)     The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers and
each applicable Revolving Lender of the applicable Revolving Lenders responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Borrowers may also invite Eligible Assignees to become Lenders.  (d)
    If the Total Commitment is increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall determine the effective date (the Increase Effective Date) and the final allocation of such
increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Revolving Lenders (including any new Revolving Lenders) of the final allocation of such increase and such Increase Effective Date. On or before such Increase Effective
Date, each Eligible Assignee that becomes a new Revolving Lender shall execute a joinder agreement to this Agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent is authorized and directed to
amend and distribute to the Revolving Lenders (including any new Revolving Lenders) a revised Schedule 1 that gives effect to each increase in the Total Commitment and the allocation thereof among the Revolving Lenders (including any new Revolving
Lenders).  (e)     If on the Increase Effective Date, there is an unpaid principal amount of
Revolving Loans, the applicable Borrowers shall, on such date or on such date or dates thereafter as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify (in consultation with Visa Inc. and having regard to the avoidance of amounts payable pursuant to
Section 3.5, in each case so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), borrow Revolving Loans from the Revolving Lenders and/or prepay any Revolving Loans outstanding on each Increase Effective Date for the sole purpose of
insuring that the Revolving Loans (including, without limitation, the Types thereof and Interest Periods with respect thereto) shall be held by the Revolving Lenders pro rata according to their revised applicable shares. 
2.28     Replacement of Lenders.   If any Borrower is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant to
the provisions of Section 3.6, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then such Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign
and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Sections 13.1, 13.2 and 13.3), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to
Sections 3.1 and 3.4) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:
   (a)     Such Borrower shall
have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 13.3.1(d);  (b)
    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
(including any amounts under Section 3.5) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the applicable Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
 









 
43
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement


(c)     in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim
for compensation under Section 3.4 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.1, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
(d)     such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and 
(e)     in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable
assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such
assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling such Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
Each party hereto agrees that an assignment required pursuant to this Section 2.28 may, if not executed by the Lender required to make such
assignment within five Business Days after such Lender is requested to execute such assignment, be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by Visa Inc. (as the attorney-in-fact and on behalf of such Lender) and the assignee and
acknowledged by the Administrative Agent.  2.29   Defaulting Lenders. 
(a)      Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law: 
  (i)     Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to
approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and Section 8.3. 
  (ii)     Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest,
fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting
Lender pursuant to Section 12.1 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;
second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Swing Lenders hereunder; third, as the Borrowers may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Loan or participation therein in
respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fourth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, to be held in a deposit
account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans or participations therein under this Agreement; fifth, to the payment of any amounts owing to any Lender or
any Swing Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or any Swing Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement;

 









 
44
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



sixth, so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to any Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by such Borrower against such
Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and seventh, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if
(x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in
Section 4.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders as provided herein prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all
Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Swing Loans are held by the Lenders as required herein without giving effect to Section 2.29(a)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are
applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
  (iii)     Commitment Fees.   No Defaulting Lender shall be
entitled to receive any commitment fee payable under Section 2.11 for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been
paid to that Defaulting Lender).    (iv)     Reallocation of Unfunded
Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure.   All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders unfunded participation obligations in Swing Loans shall be reallocated among the applicable Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis
(calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Multi-Currency Revolving Commitment or Dollar Revolving Commitment, as the case may be) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 were satisfied at
the time the applicable Swing Loan was made (and, unless the Borrowers shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions were satisfied at such
time) and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Total Outstandings held by any Non-Defaulting Lender (whether directly or by participation) to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders Multi-Currency Revolving Commitment or Dollar
Revolving Commitment, as the case may be. No reallocation hereunder shall be deemed to increase the Multi-Currency Revolving Commitment or Dollar Revolving Commitment, as the case may be, of any Non-Defaulting Lender or decrease the Multi-Currency
Revolving Commitment or Dollar Revolving Commitment, as the case may be, of any Defaulting Lender or constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting
Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation. 
  (v)     Repayment of Swing Loans.   If the reallocation described
in clause (a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the applicable Borrower shall, within two Business Days following written notice and request by the Administrative Agent and without prejudice to any right or remedy
available to it hereunder or under applicable law, prepay Swing Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Lenders Fronting Exposure. 
 









 
45
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement


(b)     Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrowers, the
Administrative Agent and the Swing Lenders agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any
conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans
and funded and unfunded participations in Swing Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the applicable Lenders (without giving effect to Section 2.29(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no
adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly
agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. 
ARTICLE III - YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES  3.1     Taxes.  (a)     Payments
Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes.   (i)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for
any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Administrative Agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the Administrative Agent or a
Borrower, then the Administrative Agent or such Borrower shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below. 
   (ii)     If any Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the
Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the
Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any
required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.1) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
withholding or deduction been made.     (iii)     If any Borrower or
the Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such
deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) such 
 









 
46
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such
Laws and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.1) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.
 (b)     Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers.   Without limiting the provisions
of subsection (a) above, each applicable Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other
Taxes.  (c)     Tax Indemnifications. 
  (i)     Each applicable Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify each Recipient,
and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.1) payable
or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment by such Borrower to such Recipient, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to applicable Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each applicable Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof after demand
therefor in accordance with Section 3.7(a), for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(ii) below. 
  (ii)     Each Lender shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make
payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, (x) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the applicable Borrower has not already indemnified the
Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of such Borrower to do so), (y) the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to
comply with the provisions of Section 13.2.1 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender that are payable
or paid by the Administrative Agent or a Borrower in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and
apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this subclause (ii).

(d)     Evidence of Payments.   Upon request by a
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by such Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.1, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to such Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such
payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be.  (e)     Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation.   (i)  Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made
under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
law or the taxing authorities of a jurisdiction pursuant to such applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In
addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will enable the
Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution
and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation either (A) set forth in Section 3.1(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below or (B) required by applicable law other than the Code or the taxing authorities of the
jurisdiction pursuant to such applicable law to comply with the requirements for exemption or reduction of withholding tax in that jurisdiction) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or
submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
(ii)     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
(A)     any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative
Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W 9 certifying that
such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;  (B)     any
Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender
becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the

reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 
(I)     in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to
which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the
interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the
business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;  (II)
      executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;  (III)
    in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I-1 to the effect that such
Non-U.S. Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of any Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or a controlled foreign
corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or 
(IV)     to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of
IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I-2 or Exhibit I-3, IRS Form W-9 and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;
provided that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Non-U.S. Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially
in the form of Exhibit I-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;  (C)
    any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on
which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a
basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine
the withholding or deduction required to be made; and

(D)     if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document
would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable),
such Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable
law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to
comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D),
FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  (iii)
    Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.1 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly
notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.  (f)
    Treatment of Certain Refunds.   Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation
to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If any Recipient determines in good faith that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower
or with respect to which any Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.1, it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such
Borrower under this Section 3.1 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that each Borrower, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant
Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required
to pay any amount to such Borrower pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to
such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available
its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.  (g)     Survival.   Each partys obligations under this Section 3.1 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of
rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.

364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement


3.2     Illegality.   If any Lender determines in
good faith that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Installation to make, maintain or fund Loans the interest rate on which is determined by
reference to any Currency Reference Rate (whether denominated in Dollars or another Agreed Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon any Currency Reference Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on
the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any other Agreed Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, (i) any
obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Loans, shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts
the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Daily Floating One Month Rate, the interest rate on the Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such
illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Daily Floating One Month Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination
no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the applicable Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Loans
of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Daily Floating One Month Rate), on the earlier of the last
day of the Interest Period or the Maturity Date, as applicable, therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Loans. Upon any such
prepayment or conversion, the applicable Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 
3.3     Inability to Determine Rates.   If the Required Lenders or an applicable Swing Lender,
as the case may be, determines (which determination shall be made in good faith) that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Loan or an applicable Swing Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, as applicable, that
(a) deposits (whether in Dollars or another Agreed Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period or day, as applicable, of such Eurocurrency
Loan or applicable Swing Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining any applicable Currency Reference Rate for any requested Interest Period or day, as applicable, with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Loan or
applicable Swing Loan, (whether denominated in Dollars or another Agreed Currency) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan or (c) the applicable Currency Reference Rate for any requested Interest Period or day, as
applicable, with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Loan or applicable Swing Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Loan or applicable Swing Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so
notify the Borrowers and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans or applicable Swing Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended and (y) in the event of a
determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Daily Floating One Month Rate, the utilization of the Daily Floating One Month Rate in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent
(upon the instruction of the Required Lenders or an applicable Swing 
 









 
51
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



Lender) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, any Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans or applicable Swing
Loans, as applicable, in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 
3.4     Increased Costs. 
(a)     Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: 
  (i)     impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory
loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except (A) any reserve requirement reflected in a Currency Reference Rate and
(B) the requirements of the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank reflected in the Mandatory Cost Rate, other than as set forth below); or 
  (ii)     subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes,
(B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other
liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or    (iii)     result in the
failure of the Mandatory Cost Rate, as calculated hereunder, to represent the cost to any Lender of complying with the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank in relation to its
making, funding or maintaining Loans; or    (iv)     impose on any Lender
or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or participation therein;  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on
which is determined by reference to any Currency Reference Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other
amount) then, upon request of such Lender and in accordance with Section 3.7, the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered.  (b)     Capital and Liquidity Requirements. If any Lender determines in good faith
that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Installation of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Swing Loans held by, such Lender, to a level below
that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of 
 









 
52
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time upon request by such Lender and in accordance with
Section 3.7, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
3.5     Compensation for Losses. 
Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time in accordance with Section 3.7(a), the
applicable Borrower shall promptly (and in accordance with Section 3.7) compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any actual loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 
(a)     any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan by such Borrower other than a Base Rate
Loan or a Swing Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration or otherwise); 
(b)     any failure by such Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to
prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan or a Swing Loan on the date or in the amount notified by such Borrower;  (c)     any failure by such Borrower to make payment of any Loan (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Agreed Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different
currency; or  (d)     any assignment of a Eurocurrency Loan on a day other than the last day of the
Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by such Borrower pursuant to Section 2.28;  excluding any loss of anticipated
profits but including any actual foreign exchange losses and any actual loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds
were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. The applicable Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. 
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by any Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.5, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded
each Eurocurrency Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Base Rate used in determining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a
comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Loan was, when funded by such Lender, funded at such rate. 
3.6     Mitigation of Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. 
(a)     Designation of a Different Lending Installation. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.4, or requires any Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.1, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to
Section 3.2, then at the request of the Borrowers such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different 
 









 
53
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



Lending Installation for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such
Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 3.1 or 3.4, as the case may be, in the future or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.2, as applicable and
(ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.  (b)     Replacement of Lenders. If any
Lender requests compensation under Section 3.4, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.1 and, in
each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different Lending Installation in accordance with Section 3.6(a), the Borrowers may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 2.28. 
3.7     Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation. 
(a)     Certificates for Reimbursement. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any indemnified amounts,
additional amounts, or compensation pursuant to Sections 3.1(c)(i), 3.4 or 3.5, it shall promptly deliver a certificate (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) to the Borrowers or applicable Borrower setting forth, in reasonable detail, the
indemnified amount or amounts, the additional amount or amounts, or the compensation to be paid to it hereunder and the basis and calculation thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The Borrowers or applicable Borrower shall
pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 20 days after receipt thereof. 
(b)     Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to
the provisions of Section 3.4 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation, provided that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to Section 3.4 for any increased costs
incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrowers or applicable Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders intention to claim
compensation therefor if such increased costs or reductions would not have been imposed absent such failure or delay on the part of the Lender to notify the applicable Borrower within the 180-day period; provided, further, that if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof; and provided, further, that no Lender shall claim any
compensation pursuant to Section 3.4 unless such Lender is generally seeking similar compensation from similarly situated borrowers under agreements relating to similar credit transactions that include provisions similar to Section 3.4 and
the compensation claimed pursuant to Section 3.4 is not in a disproportionate amount to the compensation sought from such similarly situated borrowers.  3.8     Survival. All obligations of the Borrowers under this Article III shall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and any resignation of
the Administrative Agent.

execution, delivery and performance by each Borrower of the Loan Documents, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, are within such Borrowers corporate or other applicable organizational powers and have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate or other applicable organizational action. The Loan Documents to which each Borrower is a party constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of such Borrower enforceable against such Borrower in accordance
with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by general principles 

ve a Material Adverse Effect. No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing,

Change.   Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.7 hereto and except with respect to any loss relating to or in connection with Section 9.01 of Visa Internationals By-Laws incurred during such period due to the failure of a

contested in good faith by appropriate proceeding and for which adequate reserves have been established by such Borrower or its applicable Subsidiary (to the extent required by GAAP) or (b) where failure to do so would, individually or in the

Litigation.   Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.7 hereto, there is no pending or threatened (in writing) action, suit, investigation, litigation or proceeding affecting any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court,
governmental agency or arbitrator that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent or to any Lender in connection with the Loan Documents, taken as a whole, is correct in all material respects and does not, taken as a whole, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not materially misleading in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made. 
5.11     Regulation U.   No Borrower is engaged in the business of extending credit for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U) and no proceeds of any Loan will be used to purchase or carry any margin stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin
stock in violation of the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.  5.12    
[OFAC].   None of any Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof nor, to the knowledge of any Borrower, any director or officer of any Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof is subject at such time to any U.S. sanctions administered by the
Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC); and no Borrower will knowingly use the proceeds of the Loans for the purpose of financing the activities of any Person currently subject to any U.S. sanctions

5.15     Plan Assets; Prohibited Transactions.

Title I of ERISA or any plan (within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code), and neither the execution of this Agreement nor the making of Loans hereunder gives rise to a prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code.  5.16     Environmental Matters.   Neither any
Borrower nor any Material Subsidiary has any liability under applicable Environmental Laws that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has

r of the minimum funding standards under the Pension Funding Rules has been applied for or obtained. The excess, if any, of the
present value of all accrued benefits under each Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plan), as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made, over the value of the assets of
such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Plan to which any Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate contributes is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA). Each Plan is and has been in all material respects operated and administered in accordance with its provisions and applicable law. No Unfunded Liabilities under ERISA exist with respect to any Plan, which such Unfunded Liabilities would

364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



Borrower from the Multi-Currency Revolving Lenders or a Swing Lender, in an Agreed Currency, such Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, to indemnify such Lenders
or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally borrowed by such Borrower from any Multi-Currency Revolving Lender or a Swing Lender, as the case
may be, in an Agreed Currency, then Administrative Agent may apply such excess to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations, in such order as the Administrative Agent may elect. 
(b)     From and after the Conversion Date, Loans shall be denominated only in Dollars. 
(c)     On the Conversion Date, each Revolving Lender (each a Selling Revolving Lender) shall sell,

shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of the assignments or participations purchased under this Section 8.2(c) and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such assignment or participation. Each Purchasing
Revolving Lender that purchases an assignment pursuant to this Section 8.2(c) shall be deemed to have complied with Section 13.3 and shall have all of the rights and obligations of an assignee hereunder (without the necessity of complying
with Section 13.3.1(d)) with respect to the assigned Revolving Loans or participation interests.

only the Borrowers and the Euro Swing Lender or the Appropriate Foreign Currency Swing Lender, as applicable;  (c)
    postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the
written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement


(d)     reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified
herein on, any Loan, or (subject to subclause (iii) of the second proviso to this Section 8.3) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected
thereby; provided, however, that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to amend Section 2.15 or waive any obligation of any Borrower to pay interest as set forth in Section 2.15; 
(e)     change Section 12.2 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby
without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;  (f)     change the definition
of Dollar Pro Rata Share, Multi-Currency Pro Rata Share or Pro Rata Share without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; 
(g)     change Section 1.6 or the definition of Agreed Currency without the written consent of
each Multi-Currency Revolving Lender;  (h)     change Section 8.2 without the written consent
of each Revolving Lender;  (i)     release Visa Inc. from liability under the Guarantee without the
written consent of each Revolving Lender; or  (j)     change any provision of this Section or

consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender,  and, provided, further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or
consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the affected Swing Lender in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of such Swing Lender under this Agreement, (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (iii) the Fee Letters may be amended, or rights
or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto and (iv) Schedule 1 may be amended by the Administrative Agent as provided in the last sentence of Section 13.3.1 or to otherwise give effect to amendments
or modifications effected pursuant hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by
its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or
extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender disproportionately adversely relative to
other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.  8.4     Preservation
of Rights.   No delay or omission of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise any right under any Loan Document shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Event of Default or an acquiescence therein, and
the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of an Event of Default or the inability of any Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any

Survival of Representations.   All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the
execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their
behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default at the time of any Revolving Advance or Swing Loan, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any

9.5     Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement.   The respective obligations of the
Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the Administrative Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to perform any of its obligations
hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors
and assigns; provided that the parties hereto expressly agree that each Arranger shall enjoy the benefits of the provisions of Sections 9.6, 9.9 and 10.7 to the extent specifically set forth therein and shall have the right to enforce such

have conflicting interests that cannot reasonably be represented by one counsel, in which case such expenses shall include the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of no more than such number of counsels as are necessary to represent such
conflicting interests), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by any Borrower arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan

negligence of the Indemnitee; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, (y) result from a claim brought by any Borrower against such Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such
Indemnitees obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if such Borrower has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or (z) result from a claim
brought by the Administrative Agent, an Arranger or a Lender (or any of their Related Parties) against the Administrative Agent, an Arranger or any other Lender (or any of their Related Parties) if such claim does not arise out of any act or

indefeasibly pay any amount required under clause (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Arrangers, the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each
Lender severally agrees to pay to the Arrangers, the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or
indemnity payment is sought based on the percentage that the aggregate Commitments of such Lender hereunder is of the aggregate Commitments of all Lenders, or, if all the Commitments have been terminated or have expired, the percentage that the
aggregate principal amount of the Obligations owed (including by way of funded participations) to such Lender hereunder is of the aggregate principal amount of the Obligations owed (including by way of funded participations) to all the Lenders
hereunder) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Arrangers in their capacity as such, the
Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Arrangers or the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in connection with such capacity. The obligations
of the Lenders under this clause (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.16(i).  (d)
    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of the parties hereto shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any other party hereto, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or
punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in clause (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it

agreements in this Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of this Agreement and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of the Obligations. 
9.7     Non-reliance.   Each Lender hereby represents that it is not relying on or looking to
any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U) for the repayment of the Loans provided for herein. 
9.8     Severability of Provisions.   If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the
parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.
The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not

invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.8, if and to the extent that the enforceability of
any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent or the
Swing Lenders, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited. 
9.9     Nonliability of Lenders.   The relationship between each Borrower on the one hand and
the Lenders and the Administrative Agent on the other hand shall be solely that of borrower and lender. None of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibility to any Borrower. None of the
Administrative Agent, the Arrangers nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to any Borrower to review or inform any Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of any Borrowers business or operations. Each Borrower agrees that the

relationship established by the Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith, unless it is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such losses resulted from the gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the party from which recovery is sought.  9.10

applicable, to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to clause (b) or (c) above (other than to a bank examiner having jurisdiction over it), they will, to the extent they may lawfully do so, prior to any disclosure,
notify the applicable Borrower in writing and provide the applicable Borrower with copies of any such written request or demand so that the applicable Borrower may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive in writing compliance
with the provisions of this Agreement to the extent necessary. The breach by the Administrative Agent or any Lender under this Section shall not be used by any Borrower as a defense to payment of, or the basis for set-off against or the failure
to pay, any sums due hereunder.  9.11     No Advisory or Fiduciary
Responsibility.   In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), each Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that: (i)(A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders are arms-length commercial transactions between each Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one

ARTICLE X - THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 
10.1     Appointment and Authority.   Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of
America to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent
by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and no Borrower shall have any
rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not
intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between contracting parties.  10.2     Rights as a Lender.   The
Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or
Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits
from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with any Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent
hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.  10.3     Exculpatory
Provisions.   The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:  (a)     shall not be subject to any
fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 
(b)     shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as
shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to
liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally; and 
 









 
74
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement


(c)     shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the
other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Borrower or any of its respective Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the
Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be
necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 8.1 and 8.3) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The
Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by a Borrower or a Lender. 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement,
warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith,
(iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or
genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly
required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.  10.4     Reliance by Administrative
Agent.   The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic
message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed in good faith by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement
made to it orally or by telephone and believed in good faith by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by
its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to
the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in
accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  10.5     Delegation of
Duties.   The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent with
reasonable care; provided that the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrowers prior written notice of the delegation of any of its material duties to any such agent or sub-agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and
all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent

 









 
75
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative
Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent
acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.  10.6    
Resignation of Administrative Agent.  (a)       The Administrative Agent may at any
time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrowers. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrowers at all times other than during the existence of an
Event of Default (which consent of the Borrowers shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States.
If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the
Required Lenders) (the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above.
Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.  (b)       If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrowers and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, with the consent of the Borrowers at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default (which consent
of the Borrowers shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be
agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Removal Effective Date), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. 
(c)       With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as
applicable) (1) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the
retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring (or removed) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 3.1(g) and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent as of the
Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already
discharged

therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Borrowers and such successor. After the retiring or removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.6 shall continue in effect for
the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as
Administrative Agent.  10.7     Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other
Lenders.   Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and
based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any
document furnished hereunder or thereunder.  10.8     No Other Duties, Etc.  
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Arrangers, Syndication Agent, Documentation Agents or other agents listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender. 
10.9     Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.   In case of the pendency of any
receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding of any Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and
payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on any Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise 
(a)       to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and
unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.11 and 9.6) allowed
in such judicial proceeding; and  (b)       to collect and receive any monies or other
property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to
make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.11 and 9.6.

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to
authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect
of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.  ARTICLE XI - GUARANTEE

(i)     any action taken by the Administrative Agent or any Lender that is authorized by this
Section 11.2 or otherwise in this Article XI or by any other provision of any Loan Document or any omission to take any such action; or  (j)     any other circumstance whatsoever (other than payment in full) that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor. 
11.2.3 To the fullest extent permitted by law, Visa Inc. expressly waives, for the benefit of the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders, (a) all diligence, promptness, presentment, demand for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protest, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or
nature whatsoever, (b) any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Borrower under any Loan Document or other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or
against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any

364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



of the Guaranteed Obligations, (c) all notices of acceptance of this Article XI or of the existence, creation, incurring or assumption of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations,
(d) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal and (e) any defenses or benefits that
may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties.  11.3
    Reinstatement.   The obligations of Visa Inc. under this Article XI shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Borrower in respect of the
Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise. 
11.4     Subrogation.   Visa Inc. hereby agrees that, until the final payment in full of all
Guaranteed Obligations and the expiration or termination of the Commitments under this Agreement, it shall not exercise any right or remedy arising by reason of any performance by it of its guarantee in Section 11.1, whether by subrogation,
reimbursement, contribution or otherwise, against the other Borrowers or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations. 
11.5     Remedies.   Visa Inc. agrees that, as between Visa Inc. and the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders, the obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Documents may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Article VII (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable
in the circumstances provided in said Article VII) for purposes of Section 11.1, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against
any Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such obligations of any other Borrower shall forthwith become due and payable by Visa Inc. for purposes of said
Section 11.1.  11.6     Payments.   All payments by Visa Inc. under this
Article XI shall be made without deduction, set-off or counterclaim at the place specified in Section 2.16.  11.7
    Solvency.   Visa Inc. represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that, as of the Closing Date, it is solvent.  ARTICLE XII - SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS  12.1
    Setoff.   In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the Lenders under applicable law, if any Borrower becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Event of Default under Section 7.2 occurs
and is continuing, any and all deposits (including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender to or
for the credit or account of such Borrower may be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due; provided that this Section 12.1 shall not
apply to amounts attributable or in any way 
 









 
81
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



related to the clearing and settlement of Visa card products or travelers checks or any other transaction for which any Borrower performs clearing or settlement services; and provided
further, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (a) all amounts so set off shall be paid over by such Defaulting Lender immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.29 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and (b) the
Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the
applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. 
12.2     Ratable Payments.   Without limiting the provisions of Section 2.16(g), if any
Revolving Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Revolving Loans (other than payments received pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.4 or 3.5 or as otherwise provided herein) or its participation in Swing Loans in a
greater proportion than that received by any other Revolving Lender, such Revolving Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of the Revolving Loans (or such participations in Swing Loans) held by the other Revolving Lenders so that
after such purchase each Revolving Lender will hold its pro rata share of all Revolving Loans (and all participations in Swing Loans), as contemplated by this Agreement.  ARTICLE XIII - BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS  13.1
    Successors and Assigns.   The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that,
except as otherwise permitted herein, no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (a) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.3, (b) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.2 or
(c) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of Section 13.3.3 (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in Section 13.2 and, to the extent expressly contemplated
hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
13.2     Participations. 
    13.2.1     Permitted Participants; Effect.   Any
Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender or any Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or
Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lenders participations in
Swing 
 









 
82
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



Loans) owing to it); provided that (a) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (b) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (c) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under
this Agreement and (d) except in the case of any such participation sold to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, each such participation shall be in an amount of not less than U.S.$10,000,000, or
shall be in an amount of such Lenders entire remaining Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 9.6(c) without regard to the existence
of any participation.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide
that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not,
without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 8.3 that affects such Participant. Subject to Section 13.2.2, each Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.4 and 3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 13.3 (it being understood that the documentation required under
Section 3.1(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 13.3; provided that such Participant
(A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.6 and 2.28 as if it were an assignee under Section 13.3 and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.1 or 3.4 or 3.5, with respect to any
participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant
acquired the applicable participation or unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with Visa Inc.s prior written consent. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers request and expense, to use
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrowers to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.6 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.1 as
though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 12.2 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the
Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the
Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants
interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other
obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent 
 









 
83
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding
any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
    13.2.2 Limitation upon Participant Rights.   A Participant that would be a
Non-U.S. Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.1 unless the Borrowers are notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply
with Section 3.6 as though it were a Lender.  13.3     Assignments. 
    13.3.1 Permitted Assignments.   Any Lender may at any time assign to one
or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this Section 13.3.1, participations in Swing Loans) at the
time owing to it); provided that:      (a)
      except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a
Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment assigned (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the
Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the
Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than U.S.$10,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Visa Inc. otherwise consents (each such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);      (b)
      each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned,
except that this clause (b) shall not apply to a Swing Lenders rights and obligations in respect of Swing Loans without the consent of Visa Inc. which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall not be required if an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;      (c)
      (i) any assignment of a Dollar Revolving Commitment or a Multi-Currency Revolving Commitment must be approved by the Administrative Agent, each Swing Lender and, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Visa Inc. (provided that such approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender or an Eligible Affiliate or Approved Fund (whether or not the proposed
assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee) and (ii) any assignment by a Swing Lender of any Commitment to make Swing Loans must be approved by Visa Inc. unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (provided
that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); 
 









 
84
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement


(d)     the parties to each assignment shall
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee (payable by the assignor Lender or the assignee Lender) in the amount of U.S.$3,500, unless waived by the Administrative
Agent in its sole discretion, and the Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire; and 
(e)     in connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender
hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount
sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, the
applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed
by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and unfunded participations in Swing Loans.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of
such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 13.3.2, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee
thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent
of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.4, 3.5 and 9.6 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment;
provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a
Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the applicable Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
Section 13.3.1 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance 
 









 
85
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



with Section 13.2. The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized and directed to amend Schedule 1 from time to time to reflect any assignment or transfer pursuant to this Section 13.3.1
or Section 2.28, and the addition of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.27 and to deliver such amended Schedule 1 to the Borrowers and each Lender. 
13.3.2 Register.   The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary
agent of the Borrowers (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at its applicable Lending Installation within the United States a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic
form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and the Lenders at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Loans (including principal and interest) are registered
obligations and the right, title, and interest of any Lender or its assigns in and to such Loans shall be transferable only upon notation of such transfer in the Register. This Section 13.3.2 shall be construed so that the Loans (including
principal and interest) are at all times maintained in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. 
13.3.3 Certain Pledges.   Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or
assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
13.3.4 Electronic Execution of Assignments.   The words execution, signed,
signature, and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or
enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National
Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act or any other similar state Laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. 
13.3.5 Resignation as Swing Lender after Total Assignment.   Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, if at any time any Swing Lender assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to Section 13.3.1 (other than its Commitment to make Swing Loans and Swing Loans outstanding under such Commitment), such Swing Lender
may, upon 30 days notice to the Borrowers, resign as a Swing Lender. In the event of any such resignation as a Swing Lender, the Borrowers shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor Swing Lender hereunder (subject to the

 









 
86
 
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement



consent of such proposed successor Swing Lender); provided, however, that no failure by the Borrowers to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of the retiring Swing
Lender as a Swing Lender. If any Swing Lender resigns as a Swing Lender, it shall retain all the rights of a Swing Lender provided for hereunder with respect to its Swing Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation,
including the right to require the Lenders to fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Loans pursuant to Section 2.24. Upon the appointment of a successor Swing Lender, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Swing Lender.  13.4     Tax Treatment.
  If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to any Eligible Assignee which is organized under the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Revolving Lender shall cause such
Eligible Assignee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 3.1.  ARTICLE

 (b) Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication
(including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to service of process on any Lender or notices to any Lender pursuant to
Article II if such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent or any Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept
notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.

Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other
communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the senders receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the return receipt requested function, as available, return e-mail or other
written acknowledgement); provided that if such notice or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next

or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) have any liability to any Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) arising out of any Borrowers or the Administrative Agents transmission of Borrower Materials through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability arising
therefrom to any Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages). 
14.2     Change of Address.   Each of the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Swing
Lenders may change its address, facsimile or telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto (or, in the case of any Borrower, by notice to the Administrative Agent). Each other Lender may change
its address, facsimile or telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Swing Lenders. In addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to

instructions for such Lender. Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the Private Side Information or similar designation on the
content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lenders compliance procedures and applicable law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws, to
make reference to Borrower Materials that are not made available through the Public Side Information portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information with respect to any Borrower or its securities for purposes
of United States Federal or state securities Laws.

Level I Status exists at any date if, on such date, the Applicable Borrowers Moodys Rating is Aa3 or better
and the Applicable Borrowers S&P Rating is AA- or better.  Level II Status exists at any date if,
on such date, (i) the Applicable Borrower has not qualified for Level I Status and (ii) the Applicable Borrowers Moodys Rating is A1 or better and the Applicable Borrowers S&P Rating is A+ or better. 
Level III Status exists at any date if, on such date, (i) the Applicable Borrower has not qualified for Level I
Status or Level II Status and (ii) the Applicable Borrowers Moodys Rating is A2 or better and the Applicable Borrowers S&P Rating is A or better. 
Level IV Status exists at any date if, on such date, (i) the Applicable Borrower has not qualified for Level I

The Applicable Margin and Commitment Fee Rate shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing table based on the Applicable Borrowers Status as determined from its then-current Moodys and S&P
Ratings. The credit rating in effect on any date for the purposes of this Schedule is that in effect at the close of business on such date. In the event there is a numerical difference between the Moodys Rating and the S&P Rating of
(i) one Level, the then-applicable Status shall be whichever results in the numerically higher (with Level I Status being highest) Level, or (ii) two or more Levels, the then-applicable Status shall be one Level below the higher of such
Levels. If at any time the Applicable Borrower has no Moodys Rating or no S&P Rating, Level V Status shall exist.

Schedule 3


SCHEDULE 4  CALCULATION OF MANDATORY COST RATE FOR  EUROCURRENCY LOANS, STERLING SWING LOANS AND EURO SWING LOANS
  


1.
 The Mandatory Cost Rate (to the extent applicable) is an addition to the interest rate to compensate Lenders for the cost of compliance with:
  


 
A
 the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its
functions); or   


 
B
 the requirements of the European Central Bank.   


2.
 On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible thereafter) or on the Borrowing Date of a Swing Loan, as applicable, the Administrative Agent
shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the Additional Cost Rate) for each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below. The Mandatory Cost Rate will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as a weighted
average of the Lenders Additional Cost Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the relevant Loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum. The Administrative Agent will, at the request of
any Borrower, deliver to such Borrower a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of any Mandatory Cost Rate.   


3.
 The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Lending Installation in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to
the Administrative Agent. This percentage will be certified by such Lender in its notice to the Administrative Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of such Lenders participation in all Loans made from
such Lending Installation) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of Loans made from that Lending Installation. 
 


4.
 The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Lending Installation in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as follows:
  


 
A
 in relation to any Loan in Sterling:   









 
AB+C(B-D)+E x 0.01
 
 per cent per annum


 
   100 -
(A+C)        
 
  


 
B
 in relation to any Loan in any currency other than Sterling: 
 









 
          E x 0.01          
  
 per cent per annum


 
  
300                
  

 









 
1
 
Schedule 4


Where:   


 
A
 is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Lender is from time to time required to maintain
as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.   


 
B
 is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Margin, the Mandatory Cost Rate and any interest charged on overdue amounts pursuant to
Section 2.15) payable for the relevant Interest Period or day, as applicable, of such Loan.   


 
C
 is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the
Bank of England.   


 
D
 is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the Administrative Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.
  


 
E
 is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the Administrative Agent as being the average of the most
recent rates of charge supplied by the Reference Banks to the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in pounds per £1,000,000. 
 


5.
 For the purposes of this Schedule:   


 
A
 Eligible Liabilities and Special Deposits have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the
Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England;   


 
B
 Fees Rules means the rules on periodic fees contained in the Financial Services Authority Fees Manual or such other law or regulation as
