The terms and conditions of any Incremental Term Commitments and the Incremental Term Loans to be made thereunder shall be, except as otherwise permitted by this Section 2.05, identical to those of the Initial Term Commitments and the Initial Term Loans; provided that (i) the interest margins, upfront fees and original issue discount, if any, with respect to Incremental Term Loans shall be as determined by the Company and the applicable Incremental Term Lenders, (ii) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Incremental Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Terms Loans and (iii) no Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date shall be earlier than the Maturity Date applicable to any Term Loans; provided further that to the extent the terms of any Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Term Commitments differ from the terms applicable to those of the Initial Term Commitments and Initial Term Loans (except as permitted by clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above), the terms of such Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Term Commitments shall be permitted if reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.(c)      The Incremental Commitments shall be effected pursuant to one or more Incremental Facility Agreements executed and delivered by the Borrowers, each Incremental Lender providing such Incremental Commitments and the Administrative Agent; provided that no Incremental Commitments shall become effective unless (i) on the date of effectiveness thereof, both immediately prior to and immediately after giving effect to such Incremental Commitments (and assuming that the full amount of such Incremental Commitments shall have been funded as Loans on such date), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (ii) on the date of effectiveness thereof and after giving effect to the making of Loans and issuance of Letters of Credit thereunder to be made on such date, the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Loan Documents shall be true and correct (A) in the case of the representations and warranties qualified as to materiality, in all respects and (B) otherwise, in all material respects, in each case on and as of such date, except in the case of any such representation and warranty that expressly relates to a prior date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be so true and correct on and as of such prior date, (iii) the Incremental Commitments and the Loans thereunder shall be unsecured, and shall rank pari passu in right of payment and have the same borrower or borrowers and guarantees as the Initial Term Loans and the existing Revolving Loans, (iv) the Borrowers shall make any payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16 in connection with such Incremental Commitments and the related transactions under this Section and (v) the Borrowers shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent such legal opinions, board resolutions, secretary’s certificates, officer’s certificates and other documents as shall reasonably be requested by the Administrative Agent in connection with any such transaction.  Each Incremental Facility Agreement may, without the consent of any Lender, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan 37Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to give effect to the provisions of this Section.(d)      Upon the effectiveness of an Incremental Commitment of any Incremental Lender, (i) such Incremental Lender shall be deemed to be a “Lender” (and a “Lender” in respect of Commitments and Loans of the applicable Class) hereunder, and henceforth shall be entitled to all the rights of, and benefits accruing to, Lenders (or Lenders in respect of Commitments and Loans of the applicable Class) hereunder and shall be bound by all agreements, acknowledgements and other obligations of Lenders (or Lenders in respect of Commitments and Loans of the applicable Class) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and (ii) in the case of any Incremental Revolving Commitment, (A) such Incremental Revolving Commitment shall constitute (or, in the event such Incremental Lender already has a Revolving Commitment, shall increase) the Revolving Commitment of such Incremental Lender and (B) the Aggregate Revolving Commitment shall be increased by t

Incremental Revolving Commitment, in each case, subject to further increase or reduction from time to time as set forth in the definition of the term “Revolving Commitment”.  For the avoidance of doubt, upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Revolving Commitment, the Revolving Credit Exposure of the Incremental Revolving Lender holding such Commitment, and the Applicable Percentage of all the Revolving Lenders, shall automatically be adjusted to give effect thereto.(e)      On the date of effectiveness of any Incremental Revolving Commitments, (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding (the “Existing Revolving Loans”) immediately prior to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Commitments shall be deemed to be repaid, (ii) each Incremental Revolving Lender in respect of such Incremental Revolving Commitments that shall have had a Revolving Commitment immediately prior to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Commitments shall pay to the Administrative Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the positive difference (if any) between (A) the product of (1) such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Commitments) multiplied by (2) the aggregate amount of the Resulting Revolving Borrowings (as hereinafter defined) and (B) the product of (1) such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Commitments) multiplied by (2) the aggregate amount of the Existing Revolving Loans, (iii) each Incremental Revolving Lender in respect of such Incremental Revolving Commitments that shall not have had a Revolving Commitment immediately prior to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Commitments shall pay to Administrative Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the product of (1) such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Commitments) multiplied by (2) the aggregate amount of the Resulting Revolving Borrowings, (iv) after the Administrative Agent receives the funds specified in clauses (ii) and (iii) above, the Administrative Agent shall pay to each Revolving Lender that did not pay any funds under clause (i) or (ii) above the portion of such funds that is equal to the positive difference (if any) 38between (A) the product of (1) such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Commitments) multiplied by (2) the aggregate amount of the Existing Revolving Loans, and (B) the product of (1) such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Commitments) multiplied by (2) the aggregate amount of the Resulting Revolving Borrowings, (v) after the effectiveness of such  Incremental Revolving Commitments, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have made new Revolving Borrowings (the “Resulting Revolving Borrowings”) in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate amount of the Existing Revolving Loans and of the Types and for the Interest Periods specified in a Borrowing Request delivered to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.03 (and the Borrowers shall deliver such Borrowing Request (or Borrowing Requests)), (vi) each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to hold its Applicable Percentage of each Resulting Revolving Borrowing (calculated after giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Commitments) and (vii) the applicable Borrower shall pay each Revolving Lender any and all accrued but unpaid interest on its Loans comprising the Existing Revolving Loans.  The deemed payments of the Existing Revolving Loans made pursuant to clause (i) above in respect of each Eurodollar Loan shall be subject to compensation by the applicable Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.16 if the date of the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Commitments occurs other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto.(f)      Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the applicable Incremental Facility Agreement, each Lender holding an Incremental Term Commitment shall make a loan to the Company in an amount equal to such Incremental Term Commitment on the date specified in such Incremental Facility Agreement.(g)      The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders promptly upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of any notice from the Company referred to in Section 2.05(a) and of the effectiveness of any Incremental Commitments, in each case advising the Lenders of the details thereof and, in the case of effectiveness of any Incremental Revolving Commitments, of the Applicable Percentages of the Revolving Lenders after giving effect thereto and of the assignments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.05(e).SECTION 2.06.      Funding of Borrowings.  (a)  Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders.  The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly remitting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of such Borrower (or, in the case of ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.07(f), to the applicable Issuing Bank) specified by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request or Competitive Bid Request.39(b)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume, but shall not be required to assume, that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance on such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans.  If the applicable Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by the applicable Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the applicable Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.SECTION 2.07.      Letters of Credit.  (a)   General.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, any Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit denominated in US Dollars or any Alternative Currency for its own account, and in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period.  In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of any letter of credit application furnished to any Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance of any Letter of Credit and the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.(b)      Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions.  To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall hand deliver or fax to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the currency in which such Letter of Credit is to be denominated (which shall be US Dollars or an Alternative Currency), the name and 40address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to enable the applicable Issuing Bank to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit.  If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank’s standard form in connection with any such request.  A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon each issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit the Company shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, (i) the LC Exposure will not exceed $50,000,000, (ii) the sum of the Aggregate Revolving Exposure plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans will not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitment, and (iii) each Revolving Lender’s Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed such Lender’s Revolving Commitment.  Each Issuing Bank agrees that it shall not permit any issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of a Letter of Credit to occur unless it shall have given to the Administrative Agent written notice thereof required under paragraph (1) of this Section. (c)      Expiration Date.  Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date with respect to the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans; provided that any Letter of Credit may contain customary automatic renewal provisions agreed upon by the applicable Borrower and the applicable Issuing Bank pursuant to which the expiration date of such Letter of Credit shall automatically be extended for a period of up to 12 months (but not to a date later than the date set forth in clause (ii) above), subject to a right on the part of such Issuing Bank to prevent any such renewal from occurring by giving notice to the beneficiary in advance of any such renewal. (d)      Participations.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or any Revolving Lender, the Issuing Bank that is the issuer thereof hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the applicable Borrower for any reason.  Any such payment by the Revolving Lenders shall be made (i) if the currency of the applicable LC Disbursement or reimbursement payment shall be in US Dollars, then in US Dollars and (ii) if the currency of the applicable LC Disbursement or reimbursement payment shall be an Alternative Currency, then in US Dollars and in an 41amount thereof calculated by the Administrative Agent based on current exchange rates on the applicable LC Participation Calculation Date, sufficient to enable the Administrative Agent to purchase an amount of such Alternative Currency equal to the amount of such LC Disbursement.  Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or any reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments or any fluctuation in currency values, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  Each Revolving Lender further acknowledges and agrees that, in issuing, amending, renewing or extending any Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank shall be entitled to rely, and shall not incur any liability for relying, upon the representation and warranty of the Company deemed made pursuant to Section 4.03 and, in the case of a Letter of Credit to be issued, amended, renewed or extended for the account of a Designated Subsidiary, upon the representations and warranties made by the Designated Subsidiary in the Designation Agreement for such Designated Subsidiary, unless, at least one Business Day prior to the time such Letter of Credit is issued, amended, renewed or extended, the Majority in Interest of the Revolving Lenders shall have notified the applicable Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in writing that, as a result of one or more events or circumstances described in such notice, one or more of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.03(a) or 4.03(b) would not be satisfied if such Letter of Credit were then issued, amended, renewed or extended (it being understood and agreed that, in the event any Issuing Bank shall have received such notice, it shall have no obligation to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit until and unless it shall be satisfied that the events and circumstances described in such notice shall have been cured or otherwise shall have ceased to exist).(e)      Disbursements.  The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit.  The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Company by telephone (confirmed by hand delivery or facsimile), of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve any Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.(f)      Reimbursement.  If an Issuing Bank shall make an LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than (i) if such Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Business Day, then 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Business Day or (ii) otherwise, 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that such Borrower receives such notice; provided that, if the amount of such LC Disbursement is 42denominated in US Dollars and is not less than $1,000,000, such Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing and, to the extent so financed, such Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing.  If the applicable Borrower fails to make any such reimbursement payment in respect of any LC Disbursement by the time specified above, (A) if such payment relates to a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, automatically and with no further action required, the obligation of such Borrower to reimburse the applicable LC Disbursement shall be permanently converted into an obligation to reimburse the US Dollar Equivalent, calculated using the LC Exchange Rates on the applicable LC Participation Calculation Date, of such LC Disbursement, and (B) in the case of any such payment, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of such failure, the payment then due from such Borrower in respect of the applicable LC Disbursement and such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof.  Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent in US Dollars its Applicable Percentage of the amount then due from the applicable Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders pursuant to this paragraph), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the applicable Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for an LC Disbursement (other than the funding of an ABR Revolving Borrowing as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Revolving Loan and shall not relieve such Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.  If the applicable Borrower’s reimbursement of, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Alternative Currency would subject the Administrative Agent, the applicable Issuing Bank or any Revolving Lender to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such reimbursement were made or required to be made in US Dollars, such Borrower shall pay the amount of any such tax requested by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Revolving Lender.(g)      Obligations Absolute.  Each Borrower’s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section is absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision thereof or hereof, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter 43of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, such Borrower’s obligations hereunder.  None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit, any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any other act, failure, to act or other event or circumstance; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to any Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused b

ssuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.(h)      Interim Interest.  If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, Section 2.13(d) shall apply.  Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Revolving Lender to the extent of such payment, and shall be payable on demand or, if no demand has been made, on the date on which the applicable Borrower reimburses the applicable LC Disbursement in full.(i)      Cash Collateralization.  If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that any Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Majority in Interest of the Revolving Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure 44representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrowers shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that (i) amounts payable in respect of any Letter of Credit or LC Disbursement shall be payable in the currency of such Letter of Credit or LC Disbursement, except that LC Disbursements in an Alternative Currency in respect of which the applicable Borrower’s reimbursement obligations have been converted to obligations in US Dollars as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section and interest accrued thereon shall be payable in US Dollars and (ii) the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to any Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII.  The Borrowers also shall deposit cash collateral in accordance with this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.20.  Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement.  The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.  Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrowers’ risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement.  If a Borrower provides an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to such Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. (j)      Designation of Additional Issuing Banks.  The Company may, at any time and from time to time, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), designate as additional Issuing Banks one or more Revolving Lenders that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below.  The acceptance by a Revolving Lender of an appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement, which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, executed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and such designated Revolving Lender and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Revolving Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and (ii) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to include such Revolving Lender in its capacity as an issuer of Letters of Credit hereunder.45(k)      Termination of an Issuing Bank.  The Company may terminate the appointment of any Issuing Bank as an “Issuing Bank” hereunder by providing a written notice thereof to such Issuing Bank, with a copy to the Administrative Agent.  Any such termination shall become effective upon the earlier of (i) such Issuing Bank acknowledging receipt of such notice and (ii) the 10th Business Day following the date of the delivery thereof; provided that no such termination shall become effective until and unless the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank (or its Affiliates) shall have been reduced to zero.  At the time any such termination shall become effective, the Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the terminated Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b).  Notwithstanding the effectiveness of any such termination, the terminated Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such termination, but shall not issue any additional Letters of Credit.(l)      Issuing Bank Reports to the Administrative Agent.  Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall, in addition to its notification obligations set forth elsewhere in this Section, report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) monthly activity (or other periodic activity for such period or recurrent periods as shall be requested by the Administrative Agent) in respect of Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, including all issuances, extensions, amendments and renewals, all expirations and cancelations and all disbursements and reimbursements, which written report shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent on the last Business Day of each such month (or each such other period or recurrent periods as determined above), (ii) reasonably prior to the time that such Issuing Bank issues, amends, renews or extends any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, and the stated amount of the Letters of Credit issued, amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (and whether the amounts thereof shall have changed), (iii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement, the date and amount of such LC Disbursement, (iv) on any Business Day on which any Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such failure and the amount of such LC Disbursement and (v) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank.(m)      LC Exposure Determination.  For all purposes of this Agreement, the amount of a Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof shall be deemed to be the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at the time of determination.SECTION 2.08.      Interest Elections.  (a)  Each Revolving Borrowing and Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing 46Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section.  The applicable Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall thereafter be considered a separate Borrowing.  This Section shall not apply to Competitive Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.(b)      To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election pursuant to a written Interest Election Request by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.  Each such written Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be delivered promptly by hand delivery or facsimile to the Administrative Agent in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the applicable Borrower.(c)      Each written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:(i)    the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);(ii)     the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.47(d)      Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the applicable Class of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.(e)      If a Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of a Majority in Interest of Lenders of any Class, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing of such Class may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing of such Class shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.SECTION 2.09.      Termination and Reduction of Commitments; Extension of the Maturity Date.  (a)  Unless previously terminated, the Initial Term Commitments shall automatically terminate on the Effective Date immediately after the funding of the Initial Term Loans and (ii) the Revolving Commitments shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date for Revolving Loans. In the event the Effective Date shall not have occurred on or prior to the date of this Agreement, each Term Lender’s Initial Term Commitment and each Revolving Lender’s Revolving Commitment shall in each case automatically expire, and no Lender shall have any further obligation to make any Term Loans or Revolving Loans.(b)      The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments of any Class; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments of such Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the sum of the Aggregate Revolving Exposure plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans would exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitment.(c)      The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce any Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the applicable Class of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of other indebtedness, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to 48the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent.  Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class.(d)      The Company may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Revolving Lenders) not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days prior to any anniversary of the Effective Date, but not more than twice during the term of this Agreement, request that the Revolving Lenders extend the Maturity Date with respect to the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans for an additional period of one year.  Each Revolving Lender shall, by notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent given not later than the 20th day after the date of the Administrative Agent’s receipt of the Company’s notice, advise the Company whether or not it agrees to the requested extension (each Revolving Lender agreeing to a requested extension being called a “Consenting Lender” and each Revolving Lender declining to agree to a requested extension being called a “Declining Lender”).  Any Revolving Lender that has not so advised the Company and the Administrative Agent by such day shall be deemed to have declined to agree to such extension and shall be a Declining Lender.  If Revolving Lenders constituting a Majority in Interest of the Revolving Lenders shall have agreed to such a Maturity Date extension request, then the Maturity Date shall, as to the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans of the Consenting Lenders, be extended to the first anniversary of such Maturity Date theretofore in effect (such Maturity Date being called the “Existing Maturity Date”).  The decision of any Revolving Lender to agree or withhold agreement to any extension request shall be at the sole discretion of such Revolving Lender.  The Commitment of any Declining Lender shall terminate on the Existing Maturity Date.  The principal amount of any outstanding Loans made by Declining Lenders, together with any accrued interest thereon and any accrued fees and other amounts payable to or for the account of such Declining Lenders hereunder, shall be due and payable on the Ex

 make such other prepayments of the Revolving Loans as shall be required in order that, after giving effect to the termination of the Revolving Commitments of, and all payments to, Declining Lenders pursuant to this sentence, the sum of the Aggregate Revolving Exposure plus the aggregate principal amount of all Competitive Loans shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Company shall have the right, pursuant to Sections 2.19 and 9.04, at any time prior to the Existing Maturity Date, to replace a Declining Lender with a Lender or other financial institution that will agree to such a Maturity Date extension request, and any such replacement Lender shall for all purposes constitute a Consenting Lender.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no extension of the Maturity Date with respect to the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans of Consenting Lenders pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective unless (i) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents consistent with those delivered with respect to the Company under Section 4.01 and 4.02 as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, giving effect to such extension, and (ii) on the anniversary of the Effective Date that immediately 49follows the date on which the Company delivers the applicable Maturity Date extension request, the conditions set forth in Section 4.03(a) and (b) shall be satisfied, but with the date set forth in Section 3.04(b) being deemed to be the date of the last audited financial statements delivered to the Lenders pursuant to Section 5.01(a) prior to the delivery of such Maturity Date extension request, and with all references in Section 4.03(a) and (b) to a Borrowing being deemed to be references to such extension) and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer.  In connection with an extension of a Maturity Date under this Section 2.09, the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into amendments (which need not be executed by any party other than the Administrative Agent and the Company) to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as the Administrative Agent deems necessary or appropriate in its judgment in order to give effect to such extension of the Maturity Date in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.09.SECTION 2.10.      Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.  (a)  Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan made to such Borrower on the Maturity Date therefor, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders the then unpaid principal amount of each Competitive Loan made to such Borrower on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan and (iii) to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of each Term Lender holding Initial Term Loans the amount of each Initial Term Loan of such Lender made to such Borrower as provided for below in this Section 2.10.(b)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.(c)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Borrower, Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period, if any, applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.(d)      The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.(e)      Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note.  In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and 50deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).(f)      [Reserved].(g)      The Company shall repay Incremental Term Loans in such amounts and on such date or dates as shall be specified therefor in the Incremental Facility Agreement establishing the Incremental Term Commitments of such Incremental Term Loans (as such amounts may be adjusted as provided for in such Incremental Facility Agreement).(h)      To the extent not previously repaid or prepaid, (i) all unpaid aggregate principal amounts of any outstanding Initial Term Loan shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date for the Initial Term Loans and (ii) all unpaid aggregate principal amounts of any outstanding Incremental Term Loans shall 

tion, to the remaining scheduled repayments in direct order of maturity thereof).  Any prepayment of an Incremental Term Loan shall be applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled repayments of Incremental Term Loans to be made pursuant to this Section as shall be specified therefor in the Incremental Facility Agreement establishing the related Incremental Term Commitments.SECTION 2.11.      Prepayment of Loans.  (a)  Each Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section; provided that no Borrower shall have the right to prepay any Competitive Loan without the prior consent of the Lender thereof.(b)      [Reserved].(c)      In the event and on each occasion that the sum of the Aggregate Revolving Exposure plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans exceeds the Aggregate Revolving Commitment then, upon notice to such effect from the Administrative Agent, on the last day of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Borrowing, and on each other date on which any ABR Borrowing shall be outstanding, the Borrowers shall prepay Loans (other than Term Loans) in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount necessary to eliminate such excess (after giving effect to any other prepayment of Loans (other than Term Loans) on such day) and (ii) the amount of the applicable Borrowings.  If at any time the sum of the Aggregate Revolving 51Exposure plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans exceeds 105% of the Aggregate Revolving Commitment, then, upon notice to such effect from the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall, not later than the next Business Day, prepay one or more Borrowings (other than Term Borrowings) in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.(d)      In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds are received by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in respect of any Specified Asset Sale, the Company shall, within three Business Days after receipt of such Net Proceeds, prepay Term Borrowings in an amount equal to such Net Proceeds.(e)      The applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment.  Each such written notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, subject to clause (f) below, the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment; provided that, if a notice of prepayment of Revolving Loans and/or Term Loans is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09.  Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02.  Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.  Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.(f)      In the event of any prepayment of Term Borrowings made at a time when Term Borrowings of more than one Class remain outstanding, the Company shall select Term Borrowings to be prepaid so that the aggregate amount of such prepayment is allocated among the Term Borrowings pro rata based on the aggregate principal amounts of outstanding Borrowings of each such Class; provided that the amounts so allocable to Incremental Term Loans may be applied to other Term Borrowings if so provided in the applicable Incremental Facility Agreement.SECTION 2.12.      Fees.  (a)  The Company agrees to pay or cause to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate therefor multiplied by the daily unused amount of the Revolving Commitment of such Revolving Lender, during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Revolving Commitment shall 52have terminated.  Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year (commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date), on any date prior to the Maturity Date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate and on the Maturity Date for any Revolving Loans and the related Revolving Commitments.  All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  For purposes of computing commitment fees, a Revolving Commitment of a Revolving Lender shall be deemed to be used on any day to the extent of the outstanding principal amount of such Lender’s Revolving Loans on such date and the LC Exposure of such Lender on such date (and any Competitive Loans shall be disregarded for such purpose).(b)      Each Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter, upon termination of the Revolving Commitments, thereafter on demand and upon the date on which such Revolving Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the daily amount of such Lender’s LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender’s Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate or rates per annum separately agreed upon between such Issuing Bank and the Company on the average 

June, September and December of each year shall be payable in arrears on such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.  If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount of each Lenders LC Exposure shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.  Any other fees payable to an Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand.  All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). 53(c)      Each Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between such Borrower and the Administrative Agent.  The Company also agrees to pay to each of the other parties thereto, for their own respective accounts, fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letters.(d)      All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to any Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, if applicable, to the Lenders.  Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.SECTION 2.13.      Interest.  (a)  The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing of any Class shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, from the applicable borrowing date or conversion date, as the case may be, at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for ABR Loans of such Class.(b)      The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing of any Class shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Loan or a Eurodollar Term Loan, the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate for Eurodollar Loans of such Class, or (ii) in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Loan, the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period in ef

nt of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current 54Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.(f)      All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(g)      If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Company or for any other reason, the Company or the Lenders determine that (i) the Total Net Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Company as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of such ratio would have resulted in higher interest or fees for any period, the Borrowers shall be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and with any such demand by the Administrative Agent being excused), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, under any other provisions of this Agreement. The Borrowers’ obligations under this Section 2.13(g) shall survive the termination of the Commitments and acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Article VII and the repayment of all other obligations hereunder after an acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Article VII.  Except in any case where a demand is excused as provided above, any additional interest or fees under this Section 2.13(g) shall not be due and payable until a demand is made for such payment by the Administrative Agent, and none of such additional amounts shall be deemed overdue or accrue default interest under Section 2.13(d), in each case at any time prior to the date that is five Business Days following such demand.SECTION 2.14.      Alternate Rate of Interest.  If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing of any Class:(a)    the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period with respect to any Class; or(b)    the Administrative Agent is advised by a Majority in Interest of the Lenders of such Class (or, in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Loan, the Lender that is required to make such Loan) that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the 55LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders by telephone, facsimile or electronic communication as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders of such Class that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing of such Class to, or continuation of any Borrowing of such Class as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, and such Borrowing shall be continued as an ABR Borrowing, (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing, (iii) in the case of clause (a) above, the Alternate Base Rate shall be determined without regard to clause (c) of the definition thereof and (iv) any request by any Borrower for a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing shall be ineffective; provided that (A) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice do not affect all the Lenders, then requests by any Borrower for Eurodollar Competitive Borrowings may be made to Lenders that are not affected thereby and (B) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowing, then the other Types of Borrowing shall be permitted.SECTION 2.15.      Increased Costs. (a)  If any Change in Law shall:(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement (including any compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank;(ii)    impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans or Fixed Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; or(iii)    subject the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to any Taxes on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Excluded Taxes and (C) Other Connection Taxes on gross or net income, profits or revenue (including value-added or similar Taxes)); and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Person of making, continuing, converting into or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any Loan) or to increase the cost to such Person of participating in, issuing, or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such 56additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for 

t or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for US Dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.SECTION 2.17.      Taxes.  (a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, unless such deduction is required by any law.  If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made.(b)      In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.(c)      The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, as the case may be, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on 58account of any obligation of the Loan Parties hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate in reasonable detail as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(d)      Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  The indemnity under this paragraph shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent.  Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.(e)      As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.(f)      Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax with respect to payments made under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.17(f)(i)(1) or 2.17(f)(i)(2)) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.59(i)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:(1)     any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding Tax;(2)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:(A)  in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;(B)  executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;(C)  in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of E

Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.(h)      For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from and after the date hereof, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to treat) (i) the Revolving Loans as not qualifying as “grandfathered obligations” within the meaning of 61Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i) and (ii) the Term Loans as qualifying as “grandfathered obligations” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).(i)      From and after the date hereof, the Loan Parties shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, and hold it harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including Taxes and the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any of the foregoing, arising in connection with the Administrative Agent’s treating, for purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, the Term Loans as qualifying as “grandfathered obligations” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).(j)      For purposes of this Section, the term “Lender” includes any Issuing Bank and the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.SECTION 2.18.      Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.  (a)  Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set‑off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at an account designated by the Administrative Agent, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Banks as expressly provided herein, and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments hereunder shall be made in US Dollars.(b)      (i) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest, fees and indemnities then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (x) first, towards payment of interest, fees and indemnities then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (y) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.(ii)    For purposes of determining the available Revolving Commitments of the Lenders at any time (other than for purposes of determining the 62commitment fee), each outstanding Competitive Borrowing shall be deemed to have utilized the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders (including those Lenders which shall not have made Loans as part of such Competitive Borrowing) pro rata in accordance with such respective Revolving Commitments.(c)      If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set‑off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participation in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall provide notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment obtained by a Lender pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.(d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume, but shall not be required to assume, that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.63(e)      If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it hereunder or for the account of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations hereunder until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.SECTION 2.19.      Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a)  If any Lender or Issuing Bank requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender or Issuing Bank shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender or such Issuing Bank to any unreimbursed c

 and expenses incurred by any Lender or Issuing Bank in connection with any such designation or assignment.(b)      If (i) any Lender or any Issuing Bank requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (iv) any Lender is a Declining Lender or (v) any Lender has failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver or termination under Section 9.02 that requires the consent of all the Lenders (or all the affected Lenders or all the Lenders of the affected Class) and with respect to which the Required Lenders (or, in circumstances where Section 9.02 does not require the consent of the Required Lenders, a Majority in Interest of the Lenders of the affected Class) shall have granted their consent, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement or, in the case of any such assignment or delegation resulting from a failure to provide a consent, all its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement as a Lender of each relevant Class, in each case other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by such Lender and other than, in the case of any Issuing Bank, its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to then outstanding Letters of Credit that have been issued by it, to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, if a Lender or Issuing Bank accepts such assignment and delegation); provided that (A) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and, if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, each Issuing 64Bank, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and any participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, any accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts), (C) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (D) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from the failure to provide a consent, the assignee shall have given such consent and, as a result of such assignment and delegation and any contemporaneous assignments and delegations and consents, the applicable amendment, waiver or termination can be effected.  A Lender or Issuing Bank shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver or consent by such Lender or Issuing Bank or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  Each party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto.SECTION 2.20.      Defaulting Lenders.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Revolving Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Revolving Lender is a Defaulting Lender:(a)      commitment fees shall cease to accrue on the amount of the unused Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a);(b)      the Revolving Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders or any other requisite Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); provided that any amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or all Lenders affected thereby shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02, require the consent of such Defaulting Lender; (c)      if any LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then:(i)    if no Event of Default shall have existed at the time such Lender became a Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages, but only to the extent the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Credit Exposures 65plus such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Commitments; and(ii)     if clause (i) shall not be applicable as a result of the existence of an Event of Default, or if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Banks the portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.07(i) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;(iii) if the Borrowers cash collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such portion of such Defaulting Lender’s cash collateralized LC Exposure for so long as such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is cash collateralized;(iv) if any portion of the LC Exposure of the Defaulting Lender is reallocated pursuant to this clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Sections 2.12(a) and 2.12(b) shall be adjusted to give effect to such reallocation;(v)    if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC 

 event that (x) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Lender Parent shall have occurred following the date hereof and for so long as such Bankruptcy Event shall continue or (y) any Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Revolving Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, unless such Issuing Bank shall have entered into arrangements with the Company or such Revolving Lender satisfactory to such Issuing Bank to defease any risk to it in respect of such Revolving Lender hereunder; it being understood and agreed that any Revolving Lender that is a Subsidiary of such Lender Parent or otherwise the Revolving Lender to which the Issuing Bank is referring in clause (y) hereof shall not, solely as a result of the determination made in clause (x) or (y) hereof, be deemed a Defaulting Lender.In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company and each Issuing Bank each agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Revolving Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure of the Revolving Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Commitment and on such date such Revolving Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Revolving Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Revolving Lender to hold such Revolving Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.SECTION 2.21.      Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any extension of credit or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Adjusted LIBO Rate (or, in the case of a Competitive Loan, the LIBO Rate), or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such extension of credit or continue Eurodollar Loans or to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (x) each applicable Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Loans of such Lender to ABR Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid  such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate component of the 67Alternate Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Adjusted LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Alternate Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Adjusted LIBO Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, each applicable Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.ARTICLE III     Representations and WarrantiesThe Company represents and warrants to the Lenders on the date hereof and on each other date on which representations and warranties are made or deemed made hereunder that:SECTION 3.01.      Organization; Powers.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) none of the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Co-Documentation Agents and the Lead Arrangers shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing (and it is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with respect to the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and the Co-Documentation Agents is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law, and that such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties), (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could expose the Administrative Agent to liability or be contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not 88be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company or a Lender (in which case the Administrative Agent shall deliver such written notice to the Lenders or the other Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.

In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Bank or any other Person, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuing Bank or such other Person unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank or such other Person prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, 89and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company.

If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a Lender under this Agreement with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor.  After the Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub‑agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.Each Lender and Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or Issuing Bank and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender and Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or Issuing Bank and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.It is agreed that the Syndication Agent and Co-Documentation Agents shall, in their capacities as such, have no duties or responsibilities under this Agreement.ARTICLE IX      MiscellaneousSECTION 9.01.      Notices.

(a)  No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under any other Loan Document are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Company or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.(d)      Any Lender, without notice to or the consent of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other Governmental Authority or any of its Affiliates, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or 98assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.(e)      By executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption, the assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows:  (i) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and that its Commitments and the

All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is 99extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under any Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid or any LC Exposure is outstanding or any Commitments have not expired or terminated.  The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or the termination of the Letters of Credit, or the termination of the Commitments or of this Agreement or any provision hereof.SECTION 9.06.      Counterparts; Integration.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement,  the other Loan Documents, the Commitment Letter, the Fee Letters and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  Once this Agreement becomes effective pursuant to Section 4.02, it shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Administrative Agent, shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.SECTION 9.07.      Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.SECTION 9.08.      Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Company or any other Borrower against any of and all the obligations of any Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured.  The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.  Each Lender and Issuing Bank agrees to notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such 100setoff and application; provided that the failure to give notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.SECTION 9.09.      Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.  (a)  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.(b)      Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any other Loan Document or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court.  Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.  Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against any Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.(c)      Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section.  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.(d)      Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01.  Each Designated Subsidiary hereby agrees that service of process in any action or proceeding brought in any New Yor

In addition, each Issuing Bank and each Lender may disclose the existence of this 102Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar services providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Issuing Banks and the Lenders.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.SECTION 9.13.      USA PATRIOT Act.  Each Lender hereby notifies the Company and each other Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, each Lender is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of the Loan Parties and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Loan Parties in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act.

SECTION 9.14.      Release of Guarantees.  A Guarantor (other than the Company) shall automatically be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents upon the consummation of any transaction permitted by this Agreement as a result of which such Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary.  In connection with any release pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to any Loan Party, at such Loan Party’s expense, all documents that such Loan Party shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or release.  Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.SECTION 9.15.      Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the “Charges”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.SECTION 9.16.      Non-Public Information.  (a)   Each Lender acknowledges that all information furnished to it pursuant to this Agreement from the Company or on its behalf and relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their 103respective businesses may include material non-public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries or its or their securities, and confirms that it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and that it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with the procedures and applicable law, including federal and state securities laws.(b)      All such information, including requests for waivers and amendments, furnished by the Company or the Administrative Agent pursuant to, or in the course of administering, this Agreement will be syndicate-level information, which may contain material non-public information about the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their securities.  Accordingly, each Lender represents to the Company and the Administrative Agent that it has identified in its Administrative Questionnaire a credit contact who may receive information that may contain material non-public information in accordance with its compliance procedures and applicable law, including federal and state securities laws.SECTION 9.17.      No Fiduciary Duty.  The Company agrees that in connection with all aspects of the Transactions and any communications in connection therewith, the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Lenders and their Affiliates, on the other hand, will have a business relationship that does not create, by implication or otherwise, any fiduciary duty on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or their Affiliates, and no such duty will be deemed to have arisen in connection with any such Transactions or communications.  Each of the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Co-Documentation Agents, the Lead Arrangers, the Issuing Banks, the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged, for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and its Affiliates, and none of the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Co-Documentation Agents, the Lead Arrangers, the Issuing Banks, the Lenders and their respective Affiliates has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Company or any of its Affiliates.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company hereby waives and releases any claims that it or any of its Affiliates may have against the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Co-Documentation Agents, the Lead Arrangers, the Issuing Banks, the Lenders and their respective Affiliates with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.SECTION 9.18.      Designated Subsidiaries.   (a) The Company may at any time, and from time to time, upon not less than 15 Business Days’ notice in the case of any Subsidiary so designated after the Effective Date, notify the Administrative Agent that the Company intends to designate a Subsidiary as a “Designated Subsidiary” for purposes of this Agreement. On or after the date that is 15 Business Days after such notice, upon delivery to the Administrative Agent and each Lender of a Designation Agreement duly executed by the Company and the respective Subsidiary and substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto, such Subsidiary shall thereupon become a 104“Designated Subsidiary” for all purposes of this Agreement, and, upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.04 and after such Designation Agreement is accepted by the Administrative Agent, such Subsidiary shall thereupon become a Designated Subsidiary for all purposes of this Agreement and, as such, shall have all of the rights and obligations of a Borrower hereunder (except with respect to Term Loans which may only be borrowed by the Company). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender of the Company’s notice of such pending designation by the Company and the identity of the respective Subsidiary. Following the giving of any notice pursuant to this Section 9.18(a), if the designation of such Designated Subsidiary obligates the Administrative Agent or any Lender to comply with “know your customer” or similar identification procedures in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Company shall, promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in order for the Administrative Agent or such Lender to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all necessary “know your customer” or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations.If the Company shall designate as a Designated Subsidiary hereunder any Subsidiary not organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, any Lender may, with notice to the Administrative Agent and the Company, fulfill its Revolving Commitment by causing a branch or an Affiliate of such Lender to act as the Lender in respect of such Designated Subsidiary; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect in any manner the obligation of any Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.As soon as practicable after receiving notice from the Company or the Administrative Agent of the Company’s intent to designate a Subsidiary as a Designated Subsidiary, and in any event no later than ten Business Days after the delivery of such notice, for a Designated Subsidiary that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, any Lender that may not legally lend to, establish credit for the account of and/or do any business whatsoever with such Designated Subsidiary directly or through an Affiliate of such Lender as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph or for which the making of a Revolving Loan to such Designated Subsidiary is against such Lender’s internal policies (a “Protesting Lender”) shall so notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing. With respect to each Protesting Lender, the Company shall, effective on or before the date that such Designated Subsidiary shall have the right to borrow hereunder, either (A) notify the Administrative Agent and such Protesting Lender that the Revolving Commitments of such Protesting Lender shall be terminated; provided that such Protesting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Revolving Loans and Letter of Credit reimbursement obligations, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from the Company or (B) cancel its request to designate such Subsidiary as a “Designated Subsidiary” hereunder.105(b)      Upon the request of the Company and the  payment  and performance in full of all of the indebtedness, liabilities and obligations under this Agreement of any Designated Subsidiary, then, so long as at the time no Borrowing Request is outstanding, such Subsidiary’s status as a “Designated Subsidiary” shall terminate upon notice to such effect from the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders (which notice the Administrative Agent shall give promptly, and only upon its receipt of a request therefor from the Company). Thereafter, the Revolving Lenders shall be under no further obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder to such Designated Subsidiary.(c)      Each Designated Subsidiary hereby appoints the Company as its non-exclusive representative and agent for all purposes under the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, requests for Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit, designation of interest rates, delivery or receipt of notices and other communications, requests for waivers, amendments or other accommodations, actions under the Loan Documents (including in respect of compliance with covenants), and all other dealings with the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks or any Revolving Lender, and each Designated Subsidiary releases the Company from any restrictions on representing several Persons and self-dealing under any applicable law (the Company, acting on behalf of any Designated Subsidiary pursuant to such agency, the “Borrower Agent”).  The Company hereby accepts such appointment as non-exclusive representative and agent of each Designated Subsidiary.  In addition:(i)    the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Revolving Lenders shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, any notice or other communication (including any Borrowing Request or any Interest Election Request) delivered on behalf of a Designated Subsidiary by the Borrower Agent;(ii)    the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Revolving Lenders may give any notice to or make any other communication with any Designated Subsidiary hereunder to or with the Borrower Agent;(iii)    the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Revolving Lenders shall have the right, in its discretion, to deal exclusively with the Borrower Agent for any or all purposes under the Loan Documents; and(iv)    each Designated Subsidiary agrees that any notice, election, communication, representation, agreement or undertaking made on its behalf by the Borrower Agent shall be binding upon and enforceable against it.SECTION 9.19.      Waiver of Break Funding Payments.  Each Lender (to the extent such Lender was a Lender under the Existing Credit Agreement immediately prior to the Effective Date) hereby consents to waive any rights to receive 106any fees payable under Section 2.16 of the Existing Credit Agreement which are incurred solely as a result of any prepayment of any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan issued under the Existing Credit Agreement made on the date hereof.SECTION 9.20.      Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among the parties hereto or to any other Loan Document, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender that is an EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conve

 that is an EEA Financial Institution; and(b)      the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable, (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability, (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.[Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank]IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.CONVERGYS CORPORATION       By: /s/ David R.

Very truly yours,CONVERGYS CORPORATIONBy:    Name:    Title:    [BORROWER]By:    Name:    Title:   [Signature Page to Borrowing Request]EXHIBIT C TOTHE CREDIT AGREEMENTGUARANTEE AND CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) dated as of January 11, 2017, among CONVERGYS CORPORATION, an Ohio corporation (the “Company”), each of the SUBSIDIARIES of the Company that is listed on Schedule I hereto or that becomes a party hereto after the date hereof and CITIBANK, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”) for the Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below).Reference is made to the Credit Agreement dated as of January 11, 2017, (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”), among the Borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the “Lenders”) and Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent.  Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein (including Annex I hereto) shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Credit Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, “Guarantors” means, collectively, the Company (except that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not Guarantee or be a Guarantor with respect to any obligations for which it is the primary obligor) and the Subsidiaries of the Company listed on Schedule I hereto or that becomes a party hereto after the date hereof (except that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any such Subsidiary that is a Borrower shall not Guarantee or be a Guarantor with respect to any obligations for which it is the primary obligor).The Lenders and Issuing Banks have agreed to extend credit to the Borrowers pursuant to, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified in, the Credit Agreement.  The Company will derive substantial benefit from the extension of Credit to the Designa

ligations described in the preceding clauses (a) through (d) being collectively called the “Obligations”). Each Guarantor further agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon the Guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any Excluded Swap Guarantor, the term “Obligations” shall not include Excluded Swap Obligations of such Excluded Swap Guarantor.SECTION 2.  Obligations Not Waived.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to the Borrowers or any other Guarantor of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of the Guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy against the Borrowers or any other Guarantor under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise, (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations or (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, the Credit Agreement, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any Guarantee or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement.SECTION 3.  Guarantee of Payment.  Each Guarantor further agrees that the Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to any of the security held for payment of the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent, 3any Lender or any Issuing Bank in favor of the Borrowers, any Guarantor or any other Person.SECTION 4.  No Discharge or Diminishment of Guarantee.  The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, by any law or regulation of any jurisdiction or any other event affecting any term of the Obligations, by any waiver or modification of any provision of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act, omission or delay that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations) or which would impair or eliminate any right of any Guarantor to subrogation.SECTION 5.  Defenses of Borrowers Waived.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Guarantors waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Borrower or any Guarantor or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Borrower or any Guarantor or any other circumstances that might constitute a defense of any Borrower or any Guarantor, other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations.  The Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks may, at their election, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Borrower or any other Guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any Borrower or any Guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent that all the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash.  Pursuant to applicable law, each of the Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any Borrower or any other Guarantor.SECTION 6.  Agreement to Pay.  In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Borrower or any Guarantor to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand 4by the Administrative Agent, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent, for distribution to the applicable Credit Parties, in cash, the amount of such unpaid Obligations.  SECTION 7.  Indemnity and Subrogation.  In addition to all such rights of indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law (but subject to Section 9), the Company agrees that in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor under this Agreement, the Company shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and, until such indemnification obligation shall have been satisfied, such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment.SECTION 8.  Contribution and Subrogation.  Each Guarantor other than the Company (a “Contributing Guarantor”) agrees (subject to Section 9) that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor other than the Company under this Agreement, and such other Guarantor (the “Claiming Guarantor”) shall not have been fully ind

 Excluded Swap Obligations shall indemnify such Claiming Guarantor.SECTION 9.  Subordination.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all rights of the Guarantors under Sections 7 and 8 and all other rights of indemnity, reimbursement, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the other Obligations.  In addition, any indebtedness of the Borrowers or any Guarantor now or hereafter held by any other Guarantor is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations.  If any amount shall erroneously be paid to any Guarantor on account of (a) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (b) any such indebtedness of the Borrowers or any Guarantor, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Credit Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the 5Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.  No failure on the part of any Borrower or any Guarantor to make the payments required by Section 6, 7 or 8 (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Guarantor shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.Section 10.  Information.  Each of the Guarantors assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Borrower’s financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Banks will have any duty to advise any of the Guarantors of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.Section 11.  Representations and Warranties.  Each of the Guarantors represents and warrants as to itself that all representations and warranties relating to it contained in the Credit Agreement are true and correct.Section 12.  Termination.  This Agreement, including the Guarantees, (a) shall, subject to clause (b) below, terminate when all the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash and the Lenders and Issuing Banks have no further commitment to extend credit under the Credit Agreement and (b) shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Credit Party or any Guarantor upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, any Guarantor or otherwise.  Section 13.  Binding Effect; Several Agreement; Assignments.  All covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the parties hereto that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  This Agreement shall become effective (i) as to the Company or any Subsidiary listed on Schedule I hereto as of Effective Date as the case may be, when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of the Company or a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such other Guarantor, as the case may be, shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent, and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon the Company, such other Guarantor and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Company, such other Guarantor, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, and their respective successors and assigns, except that neither the Company nor any such other Guarantor shall have the right to assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any such attempted assignment shall be null and void) and (ii) as to any Guarantor that becomes a party hereto after the Effective Date, 6when a counterpart of a Supplement referred to in Section 22 executed on behalf of such Guarantor shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent, and a counterpart of such Supplement shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Guarantor and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Guarantor, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, and their respective successors and assigns, except that such Guarantor shall not have the right to assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any such attempted assignment shall be null and void). This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Guarantor and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Guarantor without the approval of the Company or any other Guarantor and without affecting the obligations of the Company or any other Guarantor hereunder.SECTION 14.  Waivers; Amendment.  (a) No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent, any other Credit Party or any Guarantor in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, any other Credit Party or any Guarantor hereunder under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Company or any other Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  No notice or demand on the Company or any other Guarantor in any case shall entitle the Company or such Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.(b)      Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to a written agreement entered into among the Company, the Guarantor or Guarantors with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification relates and the Administrative Agent, with the prior written consent of the Required Lenders (except as otherwise provided in the Credit Agreement).SECTION 15.  Governing Law.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.SECTION 16.  Notices.  All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement.  All communications and notices hereunder to each Guarantor (other than the Company) shall be given to it in care of the Company as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement.7SECTION 17.  Survival of Agreement; Severability.  (a) All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Company and each other Guarantor herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and each Guarantor, shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making by the Lenders of the Loans or the issuance by an Issuing Bank of any Letter of Credit regardless of any investigation made by any of them or on their behalf, and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Letter of Credit or any principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any other fee or amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid and as long as the Commitments have not been terminated.(b)      In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction).  The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.SECTION 18.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract, and shall become effective as provided in Section 13.
