All accounting terms not specifically or completely defined herein shall be construed in conformity with, and all financial data (including financial ratios and other financial calculations) required to be submitted pursuant to this Agreement shall be prepared in conformity with, GAAP applied on a consistent basis, as in effect from time to time, applied in a manner consistent with that used in preparing the Audited Financial Statements, except as otherwise specifically prescribed herein.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining compliance with any covenant (including the computation of any financial covenant) contained herein, Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be carried at 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, and the effects of FASB ASC 825 and FASB ASC 470-20 on financial liabilities shall be disregarded.25(b) Pro Forma Calculations.  Any calculation or ratio set forth herein that is to be calculated after giving effect to, or on a pro forma basis with respect to, a specified transaction or event shall be calculated as if such transaction or event occurred as of the first day of the applicable period of measurement (and in the case of any Indebtedness, shall be deemed to be outstanding in the full principal amount originally incurred for the entirety of such measurement period) and all income statement items (whether positive or negative) with respect to such specified transaction or event shall be included or excluded, as applicable.(c) Changes in GAAP.  If at any time any change in GAAP (other than the adoption of IFRS) would affect the computation of any financial ratio or requirement set forth in any Loan Document, and either the Borrower or the Lender shall so request, the Lender and the Borrower shall negotiate in good faith to amend such ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP; provided that, until so amended, (i) such ratio or requirement shall continue to be computed in accordance with GAAP prior to such change therein and (ii) the Borrower shall provide to the Lender financial statements and other documents required under this Agreement or as reasonably requested hereunder setting forth a reconciliation between calculations of such ratio or requirement made before and after giving effect to such change in GAAP.  Without limiting the foregoing, (i) leases (including leases entered into or renewed after the Closing Date) shall be classified and accounted for (and the interest component thereof calculated) on a basis consistent with that reflected in the audited financial statements for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2018 for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding any change in GAAP relating thereto (unless the parties hereto shall enter into a mutually acceptable amendment addressing such changes, as provided for above) and (ii) the Borrower shall provide to the Lender financial statements and other documents required under this Agreement or as reasonably requested hereunder setting forth a reconciliation between classification and accounting of such leases made before and after giving effect to such change in GAAP.(d) Adoption of IFRS.  If at any time (x) the Borrower adopts IFRS with the agreement of its independent public accountants and (y) the SEC requires or permits United States reporting companies to utilize IFRS in lieu of GAAP for reporting purposes, the Borrower shall promptly notify the Lender in writing that it has elected to so use IFRS in lieu of GAAP and, upon any such notice, references herein to GAAP shall thereafter be construed to mean IFRS as in effect from time to time; provided that, to the extent that such election would affect any financial ratio set forth in this Agreement or requirement, (i) the Borrower shall provide to the Lender financial statements and other documents required under this Agreement or as reasonably requested hereunder setting forth a reconciliation between calculations of such ratio or requirement made before and after giving effect to such election and (ii) if the Borrower or the Lender shall so request, the Lender and the Borrower shall negotiate in good faith to amend such ratio to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such election; provided that, until so amended, such ratio or requirement shall continue to be computed in accordance with GAAP prior to such election.261.04  Rounding.Any financial ratios required to be maintained by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a rounding-up if there is no nearest number).1.05  UCC Terms.Terms defined in the UCC in effect on the Closing Date and not otherwise defined herein shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, have the meanings provided by those definitions.  Subject to the foregoing, the term “UCC” refers, as of any date of determination, to the UCC then in effect.1.06  Times of Day; Rates.Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to times of day shall be references to Eastern time (daylight or standard, as applicable).The Lender does not warrant, nor accept responsibility, nor shall the Lender have any liability with respect to the administration, submission or any other matter related to the rates in the definition of “Eurodollar Rate” or with respect to any rate that is an alternative or replacement for or successor to any of such rate (including, without limitation, any Benchmark Replacement) or the effect of any of the foregoing, or of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes.1.07  Covenant Compliance Generally.For purposes of determining compliance under Sections 7.01, 7.02, 7.03, 7.05 and 7.06, any amount in a currency other than Dollars will be converted to Dollars in a manner consistent with that used in calculating Net Income in the most recent annual financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries delivered pursuant to Section 6.01(a).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining compliance with Sections 7.01, 7.02 and 7.03, with respect to any amount of Indebtedness or investment in a currency other than Dollars, no breach of any basket contained in such sections shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of changes in rates of exchange occurring after the time such Indebtedness or investment is incurred; provided that for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.07 shall otherwise apply to such Sections, including with respect to determining whether any Indebtedness or investment may be incurred at any time under such Sections.1.08  Divisions. For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in connection with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or 27liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been organized on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Capital Stock at such time.ARTICLE IICOMMITMENT AND CREDIT EXTENSION2.01  Term Borrowing.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Lender agrees to make a single loan to the Borrower, in Dollars, on the Closing Date in an amount not to exceed the Term Facility.  Term Loans repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.  Term Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein; provided, however, any Term Borrowing made on the Closing Date shall be made as a Base Rate Loan unless the Borrower delivers a Funding Indemnity Letter not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such Term Borrowing.2.02  Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans.(a)  Notice of Borrowing.  Each Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made upon the Borrower’s irrevocable notice to the Lender, which may be given by (A) telephone or (B) a Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Lender of a Loan Notice.  Each such notice must be received by the Lender not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans, and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans.  Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be, unless otherwise agreed by Lender, in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, in connection with any conversion or continuation of a Term Loan, if less, the entire principal thereof then outstanding).  Each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be, unless otherwise agreed by Lender, in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the entire principal thereof then outstanding).  Each Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (A) whether the Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Loans, as the case may be, (B) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (C) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (D) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Loans are to be converted, and (E) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto.  If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans.  Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans.  If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month.28(b)  Advances.  Following receipt of a Loan Notice, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01), the Lender shall make the requested funds available to the Borrower either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Lender by the Borrower.(c)  Eurodollar Rate Loans.  Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan.  During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the Lender, and the Lender may demand that any or all of the outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans be converted immediately to Base Rate Loans.(d)  Interest Periods.  After giving effect to all Term Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than five (5) Interest Periods in effect in respect of the Term Facility.2.03  Optional Prepayments.The Borrower may, upon notice to the Lender pursuant to delivery to the Lender of a Notice of Loan Prepayment, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Term Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty subject to Section 3.05; provided that, unless otherwise agreed by the Lender (A) such notice must be received by Lender not later than 11:00 a.m. (1) three (3) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (B) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (C) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding.  Each such notice shall specify the date, and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans.  If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.  Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05.  Each prepayment of the outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be applied to the principal repayment installments thereof as directed by the Borrower.2.04  Termination Term Commitment.The Term Commitment shall be automatically and permanently reduced to zero on the date of the Term Borrowing.292.05  Repayment of LoansSubject to adjustment as a result of the application of prepayments in accordance with the order of priority set forth in Section 2.03 solely to the extent of any such amounts applied to the prepayment of Term Loans, the Term Loans shall be due and payable, and the Borrower shall repay to the Lender quarterly on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December occurring until the Maturity Date, commencing with the first such payment date on March 31, 2020, an amount equal to 1.250% of the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans made by the Lender under Section 2.01, unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 8.02; provided, however, that (i) the final principal repayment installment of the Term Loans shall be repaid on the Maturity Date and in any event shall be in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans outstanding on such date and (ii) (A) if any principal repayment installment to be made by the Borrower (other than principal repayment installments on Eurodollar Rate Loans) shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, such principal repayment installment shall be due on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be and (B) if any principal repayment installment to be made by the Borrower on a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, such principal repayment installment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such principal repayment installment into another calendar month, in which event such principal repayment installment shall be due on the immediately preceding Business Day.2.06  Interest and Default Rate(a)  Interest.  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.06(b), (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin; and (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.  To the extent that any calculation of interest or any fee required to be paid under this Agreement shall be based on (or result in) a rate that is less than zero, such rate shall be deemed zero for purposes of this Agreement.(b)  Default Rate.(i)   If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.(ii)  If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Lender such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.30(iii)  Upon the request of the Lender, while any Event of Default exists (including a payment default), all outstanding Obligations may accrue at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.(iv)  Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.(c)  Interest Payments.  Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein.  Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.2.07  Fees.The Borrower shall pay to the Lender such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in the Fee Letter in the amounts and at the times so specified.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.2.08  Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Margin.(a)  Computation of Interest and Fees.  All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365 day year).  Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.09, bear interest for one (1) day.  Each determination by the Lender of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.(b)  Financial Statement Adjustments or Restatements.  If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or for any other reason, the Borrower or the Lender determines that (i) the Average Total Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Average Total Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Lender promptly on demand by the Lender (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Lender), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period.  This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Lender under any provision of this Agreement to payment of any Obligations hereunder at the Default Rate or under Article VIII.  31The Borrower’s obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Term Commitment and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.2.09  Payments Generally.All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Lender at the Lender’s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  All payments received by the Lender after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  Subject to Section 2.05 and as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.ARTICLE IIITAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY3.01  Taxes.If any payments to the Lender under this Agreement are made from outside the United States, the Borrower will not deduct any foreign taxes from any payments it makes to the Lender.  If any such taxes are imposed on any payments made by the Borrower (including payments under this paragraph), the Borrower will pay the taxes and will also pay to the Lender, at the time interest is paid, any additional amount which the Lender specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield the Lender would have received if such taxes had not been imposed.  As soon as practicable after any payment of taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, as provided in this Section 3.01, the Borrower will deliver to the Lender the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Lender.The Borrower will confirm that it has paid the taxes by giving the Lender official tax receipts (or notarized copies) within thirty (30) days after the due date.3.02  Illegality.If Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for Lender or the Lender’s Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or to make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit Extension or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by Lender to the Borrower, (a) any obligation of Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge 32interest with respect to any such Credit Extension or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until Lender notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower shall, upon demand from Lender, prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Lender shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Borrower is advised in writing by Lender that it is no longer illegal for Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.3.03  Changed Circumstances.(a)  Circumstances Affecting Eurodollar Rate and Availability.  Subject to clauses (c) through (g) below, if in connection with any request for, or a conversion or continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a Base Rate Loan, as applicable, as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, for any reason (A) in the case of any Loan as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, the Lender shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the foreign exchange and interbank markets generally, deposits in eurodollars, in the applicable amounts, are not being published by the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, a United Kingdom company, or offered to the Lender for such Interest Period, (B) the Lender shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for the ascertaining of the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or any Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate or (C) the Lender shall reasonably determine that the Eurodollar Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lender of making or maintaining such Loans during such Interest Period, then the Lender shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower.Thereafter, until the Lender notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, the obligation of the Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, and the right of the Borrower to convert any Loan to or continue any Loan as a Eurodollar 33Rate Loan or a Base Rate Loan, as applicable, as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate shall be suspended, and the Borrower shall either:(i)  repay in full (or cause to be repaid in full) the then outstanding principal amount of each such Loan, together with accrued interest thereon (subject to Section 10.09), with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loan, on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or(ii)  in the case of any Eurodollar Rate Loan denominated in Dollars or any Base Rate Loan, as applicable, as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, convert the then outstanding principal amount of such Loan to a Base Rate Loan, as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate as of the last day of such Interest Period.(b)  Laws Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability.  If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, or any change in, any applicable Law or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Lender (or the Lender’s Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any of the Lender (or the Lender’s Office) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any Eurodollar Rate Loan or any Base Rate Loan, as applicable, as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, the Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower.  Thereafter, until the Lender notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or any Base Rate Loan, as applicable, as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate and the right of the Borrower to convert any Loan to a Eurodollar Rate Loan or continue any Loan as a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a Base Rate Loan, as applicable, as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, shall be suspended and thereafter the Borrower may select only Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate hereunder, (ii) all Base Rate Loans shall cease to be determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, and (iii) if the Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain a Eurodollar Rate Loan to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto as a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loan shall immediately be converted to a Base Rate Loan, as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate for the remainder of such Interest Period.(c)  Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, the Lender and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace LIBOR with respect to any applicable currency with one or more Benchmark Replacements, as applicable (it being understood that all Loans denominated in a given currency for which LIBOR is being replaced shall be subject to the same Benchmark Replacement). No replacement of LIBOR with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.  34(d)  Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Lender will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.(e)  Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Lender will promptly notify the Borrower of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date and Benchmark Transition Start Date, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes and (iv) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period.  Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Lender pursuant to this Section, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section.(f)  Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans subject to such Benchmark Unavailability Period to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, in the case of a request for borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Loans denominated in Dollars, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans.

The Lender’s books and records showing the amount of the Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon each Guarantor, and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations.  This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Guarantors, or any of them, under this Guaranty, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing.9.02  Rights of Lender.Each Guarantor consents and agrees that the Guaranteed Parties may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof:  (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Lender in its sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Obligations.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or 76failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Guarantor.9.03  Certain Waivers.Each Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Borrower or any other guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Guaranteed Party) of the liability of the Borrower or any other Loan Party; (b) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor’s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Borrower or any other Loan Party; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting any Guarantor’s liability hereunder; (d) any right to proceed against the Borrower or any other Loan Party, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the power of any Guaranteed Party whatsoever; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by any Guaranteed Party; and (f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable Law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties.

If any amounts are paid to a Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Guaranteed Parties to reduce the amount of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.9.06  Termination; Reinstatement.This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until the Facility Termination Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, 77as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or a Guarantor is made, or any of the Guaranteed Parties exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any of the Guaranteed Parties in their discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Guaranteed Parties are in possession of or have released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction.  The obligations of each Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty.9.07  Stay of Acceleration.If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against a Guarantor or the Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by each Guarantor, jointly and severally, immediately upon demand by the Guaranteed Parties.9.08  Condition of Borrower.Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrower and any other guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrower and any such other guarantor as such Guarantor requires, and that none of the Guaranteed Parties has any duty, and such Guarantor is not relying on the Guaranteed Parties at any time, to disclose to it any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrower or any other guarantor (each Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Guaranteed Parties to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).9.09  Appointment of Borrower.Each of the Loan Parties hereby appoints the Borrower to act as its agent for all purposes of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and all other documents and electronic platforms entered into in connection herewith and agrees that (a) the Borrower may execute such documents and provided such authorizations on behalf of such Loan Parties as the Borrower deems appropriate in its sole discretion and each Loan Party shall be obligated by all of the terms of any such document and/or authorization executed on its behalf, (b) any notice or communication delivered by the Lender to the Borrower shall be deemed delivered to each Loan Party and (c) the Lender may accept, and be permitted to rely on, any document, authorization, instrument or agreement executed by the Borrower on behalf of each of the Loan Parties.9.10  Right of Contribution.The Guarantors agree among themselves that, in connection with payments made hereunder, each Guarantor shall have contribution rights against the other Guarantors as permitted under applicable Law.789.11  Keepwell.Each Loan Party that is a Qualified ECP Guarantor at the time the Guaranty or the grant of a Lien under the Loan Documents, in each case, by any Specified Loan Party becomes effective with respect to any Swap Obligation, hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support to each Specified Loan Party with respect to such Swap Obligation as may be needed by such Specified Loan Party from time to time to honor all of its obligations under the Loan Documents in respect of such Swap Obligation (but, in each case, only up to the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering such Qualified ECP Guarantor’s obligations and undertakings under this Article IX voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).  The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full.
