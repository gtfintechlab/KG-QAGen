(a) Funding by Lenders. Each Lender shall make the Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by (x) 12:00 noon, New York City time, in the case of Eurodollar Loans or (y) 1:00 p.m., New York City time, in the case of ABR Loans, in each case to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative
Agents Office most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the
Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City or London, as applicable, or otherwise in accordance with the Borrowers instructions, in each case as set forth in the applicable Borrowing Request. 
(b) Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed
date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the
Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made
available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with
banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lenders
Loan included in such Borrowing.  Section 2.08. Interest Elections. 
(a) Elections by the Borrower for Borrowings. Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing
Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in
the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be
allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. 
(b) Notice of Elections. To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such
election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such
telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by
the Borrower. 
  26 


(c) Content of Interest Election Requests. Each telephonic and written Interest Election
Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:  (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest
Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses
(iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);  (ii) the effective date of the election
made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;  (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is
to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and  (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period. 
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be
deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.  (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request,
the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing. 
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or
continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period therefor. 
Section 2.09. Termination and Reduction of Commitments.

provided that each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. 
  27 


(c) Notice of Voluntary Termination or Reduction. The Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the
effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;
provided that a notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the
Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made
ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.  Section 2.10. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of

shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the Commitments, the amount of each Loan made hereunder and the Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or
to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the applicable Lenders and each such Lenders share thereof. 
(d) Effect of Entries. The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be
prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect
the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  (e) Promissory Notes. Any Lender
may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its
registered assigns), in substantially the form of Exhibit E (with such changes thereto as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent). Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including
after assignment pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be applied

liabilities or capital attributable thereto;  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient
of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or, in the case of clause (iii) above, any Loan) (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such other
Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such other Recipient, as
the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that
any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this
Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such
Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such
reduction suffered. 
  31 


(c) Certificates from Lenders. A certificate of a Lender setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis for the claim and the computation of the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower
and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
(d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute
a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the
date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to
such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
Section 2.16. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on
the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to
borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the
assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the
loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest
which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the
last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on
such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in Dollars of the affected Eurodollar Loan of a comparable amount and period from other banks in
the Eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the claim and the computation of any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
Section 2.17. Taxes. 
(a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be
made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from
any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance
with 
  32 



applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made
(including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
(b) Payment of Other Taxes. Each Loan Party shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law,
or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.  (c) Evidence of Payments. As soon as
practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(d) Indemnification by Loan Parties. The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment
to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for the claim and the computation of the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf
of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (e) Indemnification by Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the
Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the applicable Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such
Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of such Loan Party to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant
Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any
other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).  (f) Status of Lenders. (i) Any
Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In
addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower 
  33 



or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.17(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be
required if in the applicable Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such
Lender.  (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that any Loan Party is a U.S. Person, 
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on
which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S.
Federal backup withholding tax;  (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:  (1) in the
case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or
W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments
under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; 
(2) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI; 
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of
the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the
Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed copies of
IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or  (4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not
the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS 
  34 



Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-2 or Exhibit D-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each
beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;  (C)
any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender
becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from
or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or
deduction required to be made; and  (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S.
Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed
by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent to comply with their
obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA
shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it
previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
(g) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a
refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent
of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay 
  35 



to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such
indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant
to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund
had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 (h) Survival. Each partys obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative
Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
(i) For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from and after the effective date of the Amendment, the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to treat) this Agreement as not qualifying as a grandfathered obligation within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).  Section 2.18. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. 
(a) Payments. Each Loan Party shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of
amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in
the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative
Agents Office, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other
Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any
payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All amounts owing under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) are payable in Dollars. 
(b) Application of Insufficient Payments. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent
to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with
the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
 (c) Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain
payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the 
  36 



aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face
value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their
respective Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of
such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a
Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall
apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of
set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
(d) Presumptions of Payment. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which
any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and
may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the
amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective
Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.  (e)
Certain Deductions by Administrative Agent. If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 10.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any
contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid,
and/or (ii) hold such amounts in a segregated account over which the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive control as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case
of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.  Section 2.19.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  (a) Designation of Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests
compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use
reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such
designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise
be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
  37 


(b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if
the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at
its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests,
rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17) and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which Eligible Assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts
such assignment); provided that (i) the Administrative Agent shall have consented to such Eligible Assignee to the extent consent would be required under the terms of Section 10.04(b) in connection with an assignment to such Eligible
Assignee (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it
hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation
under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as
a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
Section 2.20. Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a
Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:  (a) fees shall cease to
accrue on the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a); and  (b) the Commitment and Loans of such Defaulting
Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.02), except that (i) the
Commitment(s) of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended, or the maturity of any of its Loans may not be extended, the rate of interest on any of its Loans may not be reduced and the principal amount of any of its Loans may not be
forgiven, in each case without the consent of such Defaulting Lender and (ii) any amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of all the Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than
the other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.  In the event that the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower each agree in writing that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date
specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, such Lender shall cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf
of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to a Lender will constitute a
waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that such Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.

instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to it, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. None
of the reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder (as modified or
supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

Section 7.01 would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section 7.01, then, notwithstanding any

ARTICLE 9 
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such
actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. 
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except
those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing,
(b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to
exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as
Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the
Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until
written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made
in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms
or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere
herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the
proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may
consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel,
accountants or experts. 
  59 


The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by
or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The
exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of
the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a
successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the
Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any
such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the
retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between
the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent. 
Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that the extensions of credit made hereunder are commercial loans and not investments in a business
enterprise or securities. Each Lender further represents that it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary course of its business and has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement as a Lender, and to make, acquire or hold Loans hereunder. Each Lender shall, independently
and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information (which may contain material, non-public information within the meaning of the United States securities laws concerning the Borrower
and its Affiliates) as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder and in
deciding whether or to the extent to which it will continue as a lender or assign or otherwise transfer its rights, interests and obligations hereunder. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary the Arrangers and the Syndication Agents and the Documentation Agents named on the cover page
of this Agreement shall not have any duties or liabilities under this Agreement, except in their capacity, if any, as Lenders.

the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be

  61 



effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.  (b)
Amendments. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Loan Parties and the
Required Lenders or by the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall: 
(i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender; 
(ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder,
without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby;  (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal
amount of any Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender
affected thereby;  (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments
required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby;  (v) change any of the provisions of this
Section or the definition of Required Lenders or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder,
without the written consent of each Lender; or  (vi) except as permitted pursuant to Section 10.17, release all or
substantially all of the value of the Guarantees made by the Guarantors in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations without the written consent of each Lender; 
provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and in no event shall any such agreement amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 2.20 without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent). 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the Company only, amend, modify or
supplement this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency so long as, in each case, the Lenders shall have received at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice
thereof and the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five (5) Business Days of the date of such notice to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that the Required Lenders object to such amendment. 
  62 


Section 10.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. 
(a) Costs and Expenses. The Borrower shall pay(i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the
Lead Arranger and their respective Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arranger, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein,
the preparation and administration of this Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not the Transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this
Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans. 
(b) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Arranger and each Lender, and each
Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the
fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the syndication, execution or delivery of this Agreement or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the
proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee
is a party thereto and whether or not any such claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding is brought by the Borrower, its Affiliates or any other Person; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the
extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (i) the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of
such Indemnitee, (ii) any material breach of the obligations of such Indemnitee under this Agreement or (iii) any dispute among Indemnitees that does not involve an act or omission by the Borrower (other than claims against the
Administrative Agent or the Arrangers in their capacity as such). This paragraph (b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent claims, losses or damages arising from any non-Tax claim. 
(c) Indemnification by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative
Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lenders Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment
is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as
such.  (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Loan Parties shall not, and the
Borrower will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, assert, 
  63 



and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of,
in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. 
(e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor. 
Section 10.04. Successors and Assigns. 
(a) Assignments Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) no Loan Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment
or transfer by any Loan Party without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
(b) Assignments by Lenders. 
(i) Assignments Generally. Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one
or more Persons (other than an Ineligible Person) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld) of:  (A) the Borrower; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented
to an assignment unless it shall have objected thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten Business Days after having received notice thereof; provided, further, that (1) from the Effective Date to, but
excluding the Closing Date, no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article 8 has occurred and
is continuing, any other assignee and (2) from and after the Closing Date, no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, any other assignee; and  (B) the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the Administrative
Agent shall be required for an assignment of all or any Commitments or Loans to a Lender with a Commitment immediately prior to such assignment or an Affiliate of a Lender. 
  64 


(ii) Certain Conditions to Assignments. Assignments shall be subject to
the following additional conditions:  (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an
assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with
respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and, the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be
required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;  (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment
of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement;  (C) the parties to
each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, which fee may be waived by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion; and 
(D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in
which the assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Borrower, the other Loan Parties and their related parties or their respective securities)
will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignees compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws. 
For the purposes of this Section 10.04(b), the following terms shall have the following respective meanings: 
Approved Fund means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in
bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or
manages a Lender.  Ineligible Person means (a) a natural person; (b) the Borrower or any of its Affiliates;
(c) any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (c); or (d) a company, investment vehicle or trust for, or
owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person or relative(s) thereof; provided that such company, investment vehicle or trust shall not constitute an Ineligible Person if it (i) has not been established for the primary
purpose of acquiring any Loans or Commitments, (ii) is managed by a professional advisor, who is not such natural person or a relative thereof, having significant experience in the business of making or purchasing commercial loans and
(iii) has assets greater than $25,000,000 and a significant part of its activities consist of making or purchasing commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business. 
(iii) Effectiveness of Assignments. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (iv) of this
Section, from and after the effective date 
  65 



specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and
10.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.  (iv) Maintenance of Register. The Administrative
Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and
the Commitment of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error,
and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.
The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender (with respect to its own interests only), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
(v) Acceptance of Assignments by Administrative Agent. Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignees completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this
Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register; provided
that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 10.03(c) the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept
such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement
unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.  (c) Participations. Any Lender may, without the consent
of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a Participant), other than an Ineligible Person, in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to

  66 



enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will
not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits
of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.17(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.17(f) shall be delivered to the participating
Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.19 as
if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled
to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the
Borrowers request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.19(b) with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to
the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a
non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan
Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a
Participants interest in any Commitment, Loan or other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form
under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register
as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for
maintaining a Participant Register.  (d) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section shall
not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Lender as a party hereto.  Section 10.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the
Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is
outstanding and so 
  67 



long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 and Article 9 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of
the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby, the payment of the Obligations, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof. 
Section 10.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties
hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the
Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided
in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of
the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or any
other electronic means that reproduces an image of the actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 
Section 10.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular
provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Section 10.08. Right of
Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Loan Party against any of and all the obligations of
such Loan Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or thereunder and although such obligations may be
unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. 
Section 10.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. 
(a) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York without regard
to principles of conflict of laws; provided that (i) the interpretation of the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect and whether there shall have occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) whether the Acquisition
has been consummated as contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement and (iii) whether the representations and warranties made by the Acquired Company in the Acquisition Agreement are accurate and whether as a result of any inaccuracy thereof the
Borrower (or its affiliates) has the right to terminate its (or their) obligations under the Acquisition Agreement or not to consummate the Acquisition, shall in each case be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to principles of conflicts of laws that would result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. 
  68 


(b) Submission to Jurisdiction. Each Loan Party hereby agrees for itself and its
Affiliates that any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, will be heard and determined exclusively in any Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan or, if that court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in any state court located in the City and County of New York, and each Loan Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of, and to venue in, such court and any appellate court thereof. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against any Loan
Party or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.  (c) Waiver of Venue. Each Loan Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court
referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
 (d) Service of Process. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 10.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. 
(e) Waiver of Immunity. To the extent that the Borrower may be or become entitled, in any jurisdiction in which judicial proceedings
may at any time be commenced with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, to claim for itself or its properties or revenues any immunity from suit, court jurisdiction, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of a
judgment, execution of a judgment or from any other legal process or remedy relating to its obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and to the extent that in any such jurisdiction there may be attributed such an immunity
(whether or not claimed), the Borrower hereby irrevocably agrees not to claim and hereby irrevocably waives such immunity to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdiction. 
Section 10.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT
IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO
(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT

Section 10.12. Confidentiality. (a) Each of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (i) to its and its Affiliates directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel

business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower after
the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation
to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. 
(b) EACH LENDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT INFORMATION FURNISHED TO IT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY INCLUDE MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION
CONCERNING THE LOAN PARTIES AND THEIR RELATED PARTIES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE SECURITIES, AND CONFIRMS THAT IT HAS DEVELOPED COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES REGARDING THE USE OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION AND THAT IT WILL HANDLE SUCH MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC

Section 10.13. No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all
aspects of each Transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates
understanding, that (a) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Arrangers are arms-length commercial transactions between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the

law, the Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Arrangers with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any
Transaction contemplated hereby.  Section 10.14. Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of any
Loan Party is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any
proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not
been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent,
plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate from time to time in effect. 
Section 10.15. USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the Loan Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT
Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107 56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the Patriot Act), such Lender may be required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information includes the name
and address of each Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender to identify each Loan Party in accordance with the Patriot Act.

Section 10.16. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the Charges), shall exceed the
maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan
hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest
thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.  Section 10.17.
Release of Guarantors. If at any time (a) in compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, all or substantially all of the equity interests of any Guarantor are sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in a transaction
permitted hereunder to a Person other than the Borrower or its Subsidiaries (so that such Guarantor is no longer a Subsidiary at such time), (b) a Guarantor becomes an Excluded Foreign Subsidiary or (c) a Guarantor ceases to be
(or substantially simultaneously with its release as a Guarantor hereunder will cease to be) a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of any of the Existing Credit Agreement, the Existing Notes, the Notes, the Bridge Facility, any other senior
Indebtedness for borrowed money of the Borrower, the Surviving Acquired Company Senior Notes, the Acquired Company Convertible Notes or any other Indebtedness for borrowed money of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries in a principal amount in
excess of $125,000,000 (so that such Guarantor is a borrower, issuer or guarantor of none of the foregoing Indebtedness at such time), then in each case such Guarantor may, and in the discretion of the Borrower upon notice in writing to the
Administrative Agent specifying the reason for such release shall, be released from its Guarantee in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and all of its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, and
thereafter such Person shall no longer constitute a Guarantor under the Loan Documents. At the request of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall, at the Borrowers expense, execute such documents as are necessary to acknowledge any such
release in accordance with this Section 10.17, so long as the Borrower shall have provided to the Administrative Agent a certificate, signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, certifying as to satisfaction of the requirements set forth above
and the release of such Guarantors Guarantee of the Guaranteed Obligations in compliance with this Agreement.  Section 10.18.
Acknowledgment and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges
that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and
acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:  (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any
such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and  (b) the
effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:  (i) a reduction in full or in part or
cancellation of any such liability; 
  72 


(ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other
instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu
of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or  (iii) the variation
of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.

EXHIBIT F 
FORM OF  SOLVENCY
CERTFICATE  [DATE]  This
Solvency Certificate (Certificate) of Newell Rubbermaid Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Borrower), and its Subsidiaries is delivered pursuant to Section 4.02(d)(vi) of the Term Loan Credit Agreement,
dated as of January 26, 2016 (the Credit Agreement), by and among Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the Borrower), the Guarantors from time to time party thereto, the Lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., as administrative agent. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Certificate shall have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement. 
I, [                    ], the duly
elected, qualified and acting [Chief Financial Officer] of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, DO HEREBY CERTIFY, in my capacity as an officer of the Borrower and not individually, as follows: 
1. I have reviewed the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents referred to therein (collectively, the Transaction
Documents) and have made such investigation as I have deemed necessary to enable me to express a reasonably informed opinion as to the matters referred to herein. 
2. As of the date hereof, after giving effect to the Transactions, the fair value and the present fair saleable value of any and all property
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is greater than the probable liability on existing debts of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, as they become absolute and matured (it being understood that the
amount of contingent liabilities at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in the light of all the facts and circumstances existing as of the date hereof, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured
liability).  3. As of the date hereof, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis
are able to pay their debts (including, without limitation, contingent and subordinated liabilities) as they become absolute and mature (it being understood that the amount of contingent liabilities at any time shall be computed as the amount that,
in the light of all the facts and circumstances existing as of the date hereof, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability). 
4. As of the date hereof, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis are otherwise
solvent within the meaning given that term and similar terms under applicable laws relating to fraudulent transfers and conveyances. 
5. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, do not intend to, nor do they believe that they will, incur debts that would be
beyond their ability to pay as such debts mature.  6. As of the date hereof, before and after giving effect to the Transactions, the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries are not engaged in businesses or transactions, nor about to engage in businesses or transactions, for which any property remaining would, on a consolidated basis, constitute unreasonably small capital after giving due
consideration to the prevailing practice in the industry in which they are engaged. 
  F-1 


7. For the purpose of the foregoing, I have assumed there is no default under the Credit
Agreement on the date hereof and will be no default under the Credit Agreement after giving effect to the funding under the Credit Agreement.
