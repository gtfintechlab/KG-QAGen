may increase or decrease Borrowings from each such Lender by obtaining Loans and by making repayments in respect thereof.  Within the
limits of each Lenders Commitment, prior to the Revolving Termination Date of such Lender, the Borrower may increase or decrease Borrowings from each such Lender by obtaining Loans and by making repayments in respect thereof. No Lender shall
have any obligation to make any Borrowing available if, after giving effect thereto, the Total Exposure of such Lender would exceed the Commitment of such Lender. 
3.2 Purpose  Borrowings shall only be
used by the Borrower for financing of capital expenditures and general corporate purposes (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, liquidity support for the Borrowers commercial paper program). 
3.3 Borrowings  Subject to the provisions
of this Agreement, the Borrower may borrow Loans as follows:   


(a)
Base Rate Loans: Base Rate Loans from the Lenders upon prior written notice given to the Agent, such notice to be given no later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of such requested Borrowing; and 
 


(b)
Libor Loans: Libor Loans from the Lenders upon prior written notice given to the Agent no later than 10:00 a.m. on the third Banking Day prior to the date of such requested Borrowing; 
each such notice to be given by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.3 substantially in the form of Schedule A. All Borrowings of
Base Rate Loans or Libor Loans must be requested in minimum amounts of $5,000,000 or a whole integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. 
  21 


3.4 Selection of Interest Periods 
If the Borrower elects to borrow by way of a Libor Loan pursuant to Section 3.3, elects to Convert a Borrowing into a Libor Loan pursuant
to Section 3.8 or elects to Rollover a Libor Loan pursuant to Section 3.9, the Borrower shall, prior to the beginning of the Interest Period applicable to such Libor Loan, in accordance with the same period of notice required for the
initial drawdown of a Libor Loan as set forth in Section 3.3, select and notify the Agent of the Interest Period (which shall begin and end on a Banking Day) applicable to such Libor Loan, provided that the Borrower may not select any Interest
Period that ends after the Revolving Termination Date.  3.5 [Reserved] 
3.6 Notice of Repayment  The Borrower
shall give the Agent prior written notice of each repayment of Borrowings in accordance with the same period of notice required pursuant to Section 3.3 for the initial drawdown of the basis of Borrowing being repaid, such notice to be
substantially in the form of Schedule A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Libor Loan shall only be repaid on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Libor Loan unless, in respect of any payment made on a Libor Loan other than on
the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Libor Loan, the Borrower pays all amounts payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 10.5. 
3.7 Pro-Rata Treatment of Borrowings   


(a)
Pro-Rata Borrowings: Subject to Sections 3.7(b), 3.12(b) and 3.12(c), each Borrowing shall be made available by each Lender and all repayments and reductions in respect
thereof shall be made and applied in a manner so that the proportion of Borrowings outstanding hereunder to each Lender will, to the extent possible, thereafter be in the same proportion as the Lenders Proportion of such Lender. The Agent is
authorized by the Borrower and each Lender to determine, in its sole and unfettered discretion, the amount of Borrowings to be made available by each Lender and the application of repayments and reductions of Borrowings to give effect to the
provisions of this Section 3.7(a) and Section 6.2; provided that no Lender shall, as a result of any such determination, have a Total Exposure in an amount which is in excess of the amount of its Commitment. 
 


(b)
Agents Discretion on Allocation: In the event it is not practicable to allocate Borrowings in accordance with Section 3.7(a) by reason of the occurrence of circumstances described in Section 10.2, 10.3
or 10.4, the Agent is authorized by the Borrower and each Lender to make such allocation as the Agent determines in its sole and unfettered discretion may be equitable in the circumstances; provided that the cost to the Borrower of such Borrowings
is not thereby increased.   


(c)
Further Assurances by Borrower: To the extent reasonably possible, the Borrower and each Lender agrees to be bound by and to do all things necessary or appropriate to give effect to the provisions of this
Section 3.7. 
  22 


3.8 Conversion Option 
The Borrower may, during the term of this Agreement and on a day which is either a Business Day or Banking Day, as applicable, convert any
Borrowing to another basis of Borrowing upon giving the Agent a Conversion Notice in accordance with the period of notice and other requirements set out in Section 3.3 applicable to the basis of Borrowing to which any such Borrowing is being
converted (other than delivery of a notice in the form of Schedule A), provided that a Libor Loan may only be converted on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Libor Loan or on any other day if the Borrower pays all amounts payable
in respect thereof pursuant to Section 10.5.  The conversion of a Borrowing to another basis of Borrowing shall convert the
obligation of the Borrower from the one Borrowing into the other Borrowing but shall not constitute a repayment or prepayment hereunder.  3.9 Rollovers
and Deemed Conversions  The Borrower may, during the term of this Agreement, rollover all or any portion of a Libor Loan for an
additional Interest Period subsequent to the initial or any subsequent Interest Period, upon giving the Agent at the Agents Branch of Account a Rollover Notice in accordance with the period of notice and other requirements set out in
Section 3.3 applicable to Libor Loans (other than delivery of a notice in the form of Schedule A), unless immediately prior to the commencement of any subsequent Interest Period, an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
in which event the Borrower shall be deemed to have converted any such Libor Loan to a Base Rate Loan, in each case pursuant to Section 3.8 on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, in each case unless the Agent in its
discretion acting reasonably, otherwise permits. In the event a Rollover Notice in respect of an existing Libor Loan is not given pursuant to this Section 3.9 or a Conversion Notice in respect of such existing Libor Loan is not given pursuant
to Section 3.8, any such Libor Loan shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such existing Libor Loan and the provisions of the last sentence of Section 3.8 shall apply to any such
conversion.  3.10 Notices Irrevocable 
Except as otherwise permitted by the Agent, all notices delivered or deemed to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Article 3 shall be
irrevocable and shall oblige the Borrower to take the action contemplated on the date specified therein.  3.11 Extension 
 


(a)
 Request for Extension: The Loan Parties may, from time to time, request an extension of the Revolving
Termination Date by sending to the Agent a Request for Extension, certifying therein, for the benefit of the Lenders, that the representations and warranties contained in Section 2.1 are true and correct in all material respects on the date
thereof with the same effect as if such representations and warranties were made on such date (other than any such representation or warranty expressly stated to be made as of an earlier date, which representation or warranty shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of such earlier date) except as noted therein and that no event or circumstance 
  23 




 

has occurred and is continuing which constitutes a Default or an Event of Default, not later than the forty-fifth day and not earlier than the sixtieth day prior to the then current Revolving
Termination Date and the Agent shall forthwith, and in any event within one (1) Business Day, notify each Lender of such request and each such Lender shall acknowledge receipt of such notification; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not
have exercised the Term Loan Conversion Option for Loans outstanding on such Revolving Termination Date prior to such time. Each Lender shall advise the Agent as to whether it agrees to extend the Revolving Termination Date in accordance with any
such Request for Extension before the thirtieth day prior to the then current Revolving Termination Date, provided that in the event such Lender does not so advise the Agent before such thirtieth day, such Lender shall be deemed to have advised the
Agent that it is not prepared to extend the applicable Revolving Termination Date. Within two (2) Business Days of the Agent receiving from each Lender its decision with respect to extending the applicable Revolving Termination Date, the Agent
shall, subject to Section 3.11(c), advise the Loan Parties of the Lenders that have agreed to extend the applicable Revolving Termination Date. In any event, the Agent shall notify the Loan Parties in writing of each Lenders decision (or
deemed decision) no later than twenty-five days prior to the then current Revolving Termination Date.   


(b)
Payment or Replacement by Borrower: Subject to Section 3.11(c), if a Lender does not agree to extend the Revolving Termination Date, or is deemed hereunder as having advised the Agent that it will not extend the
applicable Revolving Termination Date (such Lender being a Non-Agreeing Lender and any Lender agreeing to extend such Revolving Termination Date being an Agreeing Lender)
the Borrower may, but is not obligated, to arrange for a replacement lender (which may be one of the Lenders) to replace each Non-Agreeing Lenders Borrowings and its Commitment on or prior to the then
current applicable Revolving Termination Date; provided that any such replacement lender (if it is not a Lender) shall have been approved by the Agent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) and shall be novated into the Loan Documents in
the place and stead of the Non-Agreeing Lender by execution of all necessary documentation on or prior to the then current applicable Revolving Termination Date and in respect of which the Lenders shall do all
things and make all such adjustments as are reasonably necessary to give effect to any such replacement and the Revolving Termination Date of such replacement Lender shall be the same as the Agreeing Lenders. 
 


(c)
Non-Extension: The applicable Revolving Termination Date shall not be extended in accordance with Section 3.11(a) if (after giving effect to any assignments or assumptions
pursuant to Section 3.11(b)) Lenders holding more than fifty percent (50%) of the Commitments of all Lenders at such time do not agree or are deemed not to agree to extend such Revolving Termination Date pursuant to any Request for Extension.
 In any such case:   


 
(i)
the applicable Revolving Termination Date of all such Lenders shall not be extended; and 
  24 




 
(ii)
the Loan Parties shall not be entitled to request any further extensions of such Revolving Termination Date.   


(d)
Extension for all Lenders: If all Lenders agree to extend the applicable Revolving Termination Date pursuant to a Request for Extension, then the Revolving Termination Date for all Lenders shall be extended for a
period of 364 days.   


(e)
Partial Extension: If, with respect to any Request for Extension, the provisions of Section 3.11(c) or 3.11(d) are not applicable and there are Non-Agreeing Lenders under
Section 3.11(b) then:   


 
(i)
the applicable Revolving Termination Date for the Agreeing Lenders (including any Lender that is a replacement Lender pursuant to Section 3.11(b)) shall be extended for a period of 364 days; and 
 


 
(ii)
the applicable Revolving Termination Date for the Non-Agreeing Lenders shall not be extended. 
 


(f)
Independent Decision: Each Loan Party understands that consideration of any Request for Extension constitutes an independent credit decision which each Lender retains the absolute and unfettered discretion to
make and that no commitment in this regard is hereby given by any Lender.  3.12 Takeover Notification 
In the event the Borrower wishes to utilize Borrowings to, or to provide funds to any Subsidiary to, offer to acquire (which shall include an
offer to purchase securities, solicitation of an offer to sell securities or an acceptance of an offer to sell securities, whether or not the offer to sell was solicited, or any combination of the foregoing) outstanding securities of any Person
(other than a private issuer as defined in National Instrument 45-106Prospectus and Registration Exemptions or a Person whose shares or equity interests are directly or indirectly held
by one Person) (the Target) where, as of the date of the offer to acquire, the securities that are subject to the offer to acquire, together with the securities of the Target that are beneficially owned, or over which control or
direction is exercised, by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and any Person acting jointly or in concert with any thereof on the date that the offer to acquire is made, constitute in the aggregate the lesser of such percentage of outstanding
securities as is considered to be a takeover bid under any law or regulation applicable to the Target and twenty percent (20%) or more of all of the outstanding securities of that class of securities of the Target (a
Takeover) except where such Takeover is made pursuant to exemptions from formal takeover bid requirements as provided in: (i) Part 4 of Multilateral Instrument 62-104 -
Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids and analogous provisions of the Securities Act (Ontario) or in any successor legislation or securities instrument, rule or blanket order, (ii) any order of a
provincial or territorial securities commission or similar regulatory authority in a province or territory of Canada, or (iii) any analogous provisions of the securities laws of any other jurisdiction or in any order, ruling or other
form of exemptive relief provided by a securities commission or securities regulatory authority of any other jurisdiction, then either: 
  25 




(a)
Agreement of the Target Entity: the Borrower shall provide to the Agent evidence satisfactory to the Agent of the agreement of the board of directors or like body of the Target approving the Takeover; or
  


(b)
No Conflict by Lenders: the following steps shall be followed:   


 
(i)
at least five Business Days prior to the delivery of any notice to the Agent pursuant to Section 3.3 requesting Loans intended to be utilized for such Takeover, the Borrower shall notify the Agent who shall
promptly notify each Lender of the particulars of such Takeover in sufficient detail to enable such Lender to determine whether it has a conflict of interest if Loans from such Lender are utilized by the Borrower for such Takeover;
  


 
(ii)
within three Business Days of being so notified, each such Lender shall notify the Agent of such Lenders determination, acting reasonably, as to whether such a conflict of interest exists (such determination to be
made by such Lender in the exercise of its sole discretion having regard to such considerations as it deems appropriate), provided that if such Lender does not so notify the Agent within three Business Days, such Lender shall be deemed to have
notified the Agent that it has no such conflict of interest (any such Lender having such a conflict of interest being a Conflicted Lender and any such Lender having no such conflict of interest being a Non-Conflicted Lender); and   


 
(iii)
the Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of each Lenders determination.  In the event
that any Lender has determined it is a Conflicted Lender, then upon the Agent so notifying the Borrower, such Lender shall have no obligation to provide Loans for such Takeover notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary;
provided, however, that each other Non-Conflicted Lender shall have an obligation, up to the amount of its Commitment, to provide Loans for such Takeover, and any such Loans for such Takeover shall be provided
by each Non-Conflicted Lender in accordance with the ratio that its Lenders Proportion bears to the aggregate of the Lenders Proportions of all the
Non-Conflicted Lenders.   


(c)
Adjustment: If Loans are utilized for the purposes of a Takeover (a Takeover Loan) and there are Conflicted Lenders, the Lenders Proportion of each
Non-Conflicted Lender shall be temporarily adjusted in accordance with Section 3.12(b) and subsequent Loans shall be funded firstly by Conflicted Lenders and subsequent repayments shall be applied firstly to
amounts owed to Non-Conflicted Lenders, in each case, until such time as the Lenders Proportion of each Non-Conflicted Lender and Conflicted Lender is equal to
such Lenders Proportion in effect immediately prior to the advance of the Takeover Loan.  3.13 Increase in the Aggregate
Commitments   


(a)
 The Loan Parties may, at any time, unless such request is to replace the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender, by
means of a letter to the Agent, request that the aggregate Commitments be increased (a Commitment Increase) as of the date specified in such 
  26 




 

letter (the Increase Date) by (i) increasing the Commitment of one or more Lenders which have agreed to such increase (an Increasing Lender) (it being
understood that no Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Commitment pursuant to this Section 3.13) and/or (ii) adding one or more Permitted Assignees as a party hereto with a Commitment in an amount agreed to by such Permitted
Assignee; provided that (A) in no event shall the aggregate amount of the aggregate Commitments exceed $1,500,000,000 and (B) the Commitment of each such Permitted Assignee shall be in an amount of $10,000,000 or more. 
 


(b)
On each Increase Date, each Permitted Assignee that accepts an offer to participate in a requested Commitment Increase in accordance with Section 3.13(a) (each, an Assuming Lender) shall become a
Lender party to this Agreement as of such Increase Date and the Commitment of each Increasing Lender for such requested Commitment Increase shall be so increased by such amount as of such Increase Date; provided that: 
 


 
(i)
on such Increase Date, the following statements shall be true and the Agent shall have received for the account of each Lender a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer of TCPL, dated such Increase Date, stating
that the representations and warranties contained in Section 2.1 are true and correct in all material respects on the date thereof with the same effect as if such representations and warranties were made on such date (other than any such
representation or warranty expressly stated to be made as of an earlier date, which representation or warranty shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date), before and after giving effect to the Commitment Increase, as
though made on and as of such Increase Date and no event or circumstance has occurred and is continuing which constitutes an Event of Default or a Default;   


 
(ii)
on or before such Increase Date, the Agent shall have received the following, each dated such Increase Date, in sufficient copies for each Lender (including each Assuming Lender): (A) confirmation that the resolutions
delivered in accordance with Section 7.1(a)(iv) remain in effect, or certified copies of other resolutions of the board of directors of each Loan Party, in either case, which authorize the Commitment Increase and any corresponding modifications to
this Agreement, (B) such other approvals or documents as any Lender through the Agent may reasonably request in connection with such Commitment Increase, (C) an assumption agreement from each Assuming Lender, if any, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Loan Parties and the Agent, duly executed by such Permitted Assignee, the Agent and the Loan Parties and (D) confirmation from each Increasing Lender of the increase in the amount of its Commitment in a writing satisfactory
to the Loan Parties and the Agent.  On each Increase Date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence of this Section 3.13(b), the Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without limitation, each Assuming Lender) and the Loan Parties, on or before 1:00 p.m., by telecopier, of the occurrence of the Commitment Increase to be effected on
such Increase Date and shall record the relevant information with respect to each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender on such date. Each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender shall, before 2:00 p.m. on the

  27 



Increase Date, make available to the Agent at the Agents Applicable Account for Payments, in same day funds, an aggregate amount to be distributed to the other Lenders such that the
aggregate amount of the outstanding Loans owing to each Lender after giving effect to such distribution equals such Lenders ratable portion of the Borrowings then outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate
Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase). The Borrower acknowledges that, in order to maintain Loans in accordance with each Lenders ratable share thereof, a reallocation of the Commitments as a result
of a non-pro-rata increase in the aggregate Commitments may require prepayment of all or portions of certain Loans on the date of such increase (and any such prepayment
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 10.5).  ARTICLE 4 
REPAYMENT AND PREPAYMENT  4.1 Reduction
of Commitment, Repayment of Borrowings, Term Loan Conversion Option   


(a)
Subject to Section 4.1(b), on the Revolving Termination Date of each Lender, the Borrower shall repay all Borrowings and all other amounts owing hereunder to such Lender and the Commitment of such Lender shall be
reduced to zero. The Borrower shall ensure that all Libor Loans forming a part of the Borrowings of such Lender mature on or before the Revolving Termination Date or, if applicable, the Maturity Date. 
 


(b)
The Loan Parties may, upon notice given to the Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. fifteen (15) days prior to the Revolving Termination Date, and payment to the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders a fee equal
to 0.75% of the aggregate principal amount of the Borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Termination Date, payable on the Revolving Termination Date, convert all or a part of the unpaid principal amount of the Loans outstanding as of the Revolving
Termination Date into Term Loans. If this Term Loan Conversion Option is exercised, then, on the Revolving Termination Date, immediately prior to the time when the unpaid principal amount of such Loans would otherwise be due, such Loans shall
automatically convert into Term Loans which the Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the ratable accounts of the Lenders on the Maturity Date, and the Loans that are not converted into Term Loans shall be due and payable on the Revolving
Termination Date. The amounts so converted shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as Loans except that after the Revolving Termination Date:   


 
(i)
the Borrower may not make any additional Borrowings;   


 
(ii)
any amounts paid or prepaid may not be reborrowed;   


 
(iii)
the amount of each Lenders Commitment shall be equal at all times to the principal amount of the Term Loans payable to such Lender from time to time; 
 


 
(iv)
the provisions of Section 3.11 shall no longer be effective; and   


 
(v)
no Commitment Fees shall accrue or be payable under Section 5.5 after the Revolving Termination Date. 
  28 


4.2 Cancellation of Commitment, Repayment of Borrowings and Prepayment and Replacement 
The Borrower may, without penalty or premium, at any time and from time to time during the term of this Agreement upon written notice
substantially in the form of Schedule A given no later than the third Business Day prior to the cancellation date set out in such notice, cancel all of the Total Commitment or any portion thereof in minimum amounts of $10,000,000 and whole multiples
thereafter of $1,000,000 by canceling the Commitment of each Lender in an amount equal to such Lenders Proportion of the amount of the Total Commitment being so cancelled; provided that on or prior to the day immediately preceding the
cancellation date set out in such notice the Borrower has:   


(a)
Prepaid Borrowings: prepaid or otherwise reduced Borrowings outstanding to each Lender in an amount equal to the amount by which such Lenders Total Exposure would otherwise be in excess of the amount of
such Lenders Commitment immediately after the reduction of the Total Commitment provided for in such notice; and   


(b)
Paid Interest: paid all accrued interest and other charges and fees in respect of the Borrowings being repaid or reduced as aforesaid. 
Any such notice of cancellation is irrevocable and the amount of the Total Commitment and each Lenders Commitment so cancelled and
reduced may not be reinstated hereunder.  Subject to Section 10.5, the Borrower shall be entitled at any time or from time to time,
upon irrevocable notice given no later than the third Business Day prior to the date of prepayment to the Agent, to ratably prepay Loans in whole or in part in minimum amounts of $10,000,000 and whole multiples thereafter of $1,000,000 without
premium or penalty. Each notice of payment shall specify the date and aggregate principal amount of any such prepayment and the Loans to be repaid. The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of any such notice and of the Lenders
Proportion of such Lender of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount, specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with all
accrued interest to each such date on the amount prepaid, and any amounts required in accordance with Section 10.5 hereof as a result of such prepayment. 
In addition to the foregoing and if a Lender is (in this Section 4.2, an Affected Lender and any Lender which is not
an Affected Lender being an Unaffected Lender):   


 
(i)
a Conflicted Lender who has not waived its status as a Conflicted Lender pursuant to Section 3.12(b)(ii);   


 
(ii)
a Lender in respect of whom the Borrower has been required to make increased payments pursuant to Section 6.3(a);   


 
(iii)
a Lender who has invoked the provisions of Section 10.2, Section 10.3 or Section 10.4; 
  29 




 
(iv)
a Lender who has not consented to a request by the Borrower to an amendment or waiver that (i) requires the approval of all affected Lenders in accordance with the terms of Section 11.12 and (ii) has been
approved by the Majority Lenders; or   


 
(v)
a Defaulting Lender;  the Borrower may without prejudice to any other right or remedy the
Borrower may have in respect of a Defaulting Lender:   


(c)
Payment: so long as there exists no Event of Default and subject to Section 10.5 (other than in respect of the circumstances referred to in clause (iv) of the immediately preceding paragraph, in which
case no such conditions shall apply), repay all Borrowings and other amounts owing hereunder to such Affected Lender and upon such payment such Affected Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder and such Affected Lenders Commitment shall be
terminated and the Total Commitment reduced accordingly; or   


(d)
Replacement: arrange for a replacement lender (which may be one of the Lenders) to replace such Affected Lenders Borrowings and its Commitment(s), provided that, if such replacement occurs prior to the
effectiveness of any exercise of the Term Loan Conversion Option, any such replacement lender (if it is not a Lender) shall have been approved by the Agent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) and shall be novated into the Loan Documents
in the place and stead of such Affected Lender by execution of all necessary documentation and in respect of which the Lenders shall do all things and make all such adjustments as are reasonably necessary to give effect to any such replacement.
 4.3 Evidence of Indebtedness 
The Agent shall open and maintain on the books at the Agents Branch of Account accounts and records (collectively, the
Accounts) evidencing the Borrowings and other amounts owing by the Borrower to the Agent and each Lender under this Agreement. The Agent shall debit therein the amount of such Borrowings and shall enter therein as a credit each
payment of principal of and interest on the Borrowings and fees and other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement by the Borrower and shall record all other amounts becoming due to the Agent and each Lender under this Agreement. The Accounts
constitute, in the absence of manifest error, prima facie evidence of the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Agent and each Lender pursuant to this Agreement, the date each Lender made each Borrowing available to the Borrower and the amounts
the Borrower has paid from time to time on account of the principal of and interest on the Borrowings, fees payable pursuant to this Agreement and other amounts owing hereunder. 
4.4 Defaulting Lenders  Anything
contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding: 
  30 




(a)
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, until such time as the Default Excess with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall have been reduced to zero, any prepayment of the Loans shall, if the Borrower so directs at the
time of making such prepayment, be applied to the Loans of other Lenders as if such Defaulting Lender had no Loans outstanding;   


(b)
no Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have
been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender);   


(c)
the unused Commitment and Borrowings of each Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Majority Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder, provided that any waiver or
amendment to a provision of the Loan Documents that relates to the matters set forth in Section 11.12(a) that require the consent of all Lenders (other than clause (ii) of the first sentence thereof) or each affected Lender shall require the
consent of such Defaulting Lender (but only, in the case of an amendment or waiver requiring the consent of affected Lenders, to the extent such Defaulting Lender is directly affected thereby); 
 


(d)
the aggregate amount of the Loans as at any date of determination shall be calculated as if such Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Advances of such Defaulting Lender for purposes of determining the aggregate
amount of the total Commitments available to be drawn by the Borrower;   


(e)
[reserved]   


(f)
[reserved]; and   


(g)
any amount payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder (whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, but excluding amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.2) may at the discretion of the Agent and
shall, upon five Business Days prior written notice from the Borrower, subject to any applicable requirements of law, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Lender, be retained by the Agent in a segregated account and be applied at such
time or times as may be determined by the Agent (i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder, (ii) second, to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed
to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, (iii) third, if so determined by the Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future
funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement, (iv) fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting
Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement, (v) fifth, so long as no Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement and (vi) sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a
court of competent jurisdiction. 
  31 


No Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise affected, and, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Section 4.4, performance by the Borrower or any Lender of its obligations hereunder shall not be excused or otherwise modified as a result of any failure by a Defaulting Lender to fund or the operation of this
Section 4.4. The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this Section 4.4 are in addition to other rights and remedies that the Borrower, the Agent or any other Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to
any Defaulted Advance.  ARTICLE 5 
PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND FEES  5.1
Interest on Base Rate Loans  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent on behalf of each Lender interest on each Base Rate Loan made by each
such Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. A change in the Base Rate shall simultaneously cause a corresponding change in the interest payable for a Base Rate Loan. Such interest shall be payable quarterly in
arrears on the third Business Day following each Interest Date applicable to such Base Rate Loan or on the Revolving Termination Date of each such Lender (or, if later, on the Maturity Date) for the period commencing on and including the day of the
advance of each such Base Rate Loan or the day after the immediately preceding Interest Date to which interest has been paid, as applicable, up to and including the Interest Date to which interest is payable or up to but excluding the Revolving
Termination Date of each such Lender (or, if later, on the Maturity Date) and shall be calculated on a daily basis on the principal amount outstanding under each such Base Rate Loan in such period based on the actual number of days elapsed in the
period for which such interest is payable divided by three hundred sixty-five (365) or three hundred and sixty-six (366) depending on the actual number of days in the year for which such interest is
determined.  5.2 [Reserved]  5.3 Interest on
Libor Loans  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent on behalf of each Lender interest in Dollars on each Libor Loan made by each such
Lender at a per annum rate of interest based on a three hundred sixty (360) day year equal to the sum of Libor plus the Applicable Margin on the first day of the Interest Period applicable to such Libor Loan. Such interest shall be payable in
arrears on each Interest Date applicable to such Libor Loan for the period commencing on and including the day of advance of each such Libor Loan or the last Interest Date to which interest has been paid, as applicable, up to but excluding the
Interest Date to which such interest is payable and shall be calculated on a daily basis on the principal amount outstanding under each such Libor Loan in such Interest Period based on the actual number of days elapsed in the period for which such

  32 


5.4 Interest on Overdue Amounts 
The Borrower shall, on demand, pay to the Agent on behalf of each Lender interest on all overdue payments owing by it in connection with this
Agreement from the date any such payment becomes overdue and for so long as such amount remains unpaid at a rate per annum which is equal to the sum of the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin plus 2% per annum; provided, however, that with respect
to a payment in respect of a Libor Loan, the rate applicable to such overdue payment shall be an interest rate equal to the interest rate otherwise applicable to such Libor Loan (including the Applicable Margin) plus 2% per annum. 
Such interest on overdue amounts shall be compounded monthly and shall be payable both before and after default, maturity and judgment. 
5.5 Commitment Fees  Prior to the
Revolving Termination Date of each Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender), the Borrower shall pay Commitment Fees to the Agent on behalf of each Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) at the Agents Applicable Account for Payments quarterly
in arrears on the third Business Day of each calendar quarter in each year commencing with the third Business Day of the calendar quarter occurring after the Effective Date and ending on the Revolving Termination Date for such Lender. Each payment
of Commitment Fees shall be calculated for the period commencing on and including the Effective Date or the first day of the calendar quarter following a calendar quarter for which Commitment Fees have been paid, as the case may be, up to and
including the last day of such calendar quarter or the Revolving Termination Date of each Lender and shall be in an amount equal to the Commitment Fee Rate as set forth in the definition of Applicable Margin calculated daily
on the amount, if any, of the difference obtained by subtracting the Borrowings outstanding from such Lender on such day from the amount of such Lenders Commitment in effect on such day during such period. Such Commitment Fees shall be
calculated on a daily basis and on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of three hundred sixty (360) days.  5.6 [Reserved]
 5.7 Agents Fees  The
Borrower shall pay agency fees to the Agent for the Agents sole account at the Agents Applicable Account for Payments at the time or times and in the amount agreed to in writing by the Borrower and the Agent. Such fees shall, for
purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to be amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement.  5.8 Maximum Rate Permitted by Law 
Under no circumstances shall a Lender be entitled to receive nor shall it in fact receive a payment or partial payment of interest, fees or
other amounts under this Agreement at a rate that is prohibited by Applicable Law. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything herein or elsewhere contained, if and to the extent that under any circumstances, the effective annual rate of
interest (as defined in Section 347 of the Criminal Code of Canada) received or to be received by a Lender (determined in accordance with such section) on any amount of credit advanced (as defined in
that section) pursuant to these presents or any agreement or arrangement collateral hereto entered into in consequence or implementation hereof would, but for this Section 5.8 be a rate that is prohibited by Applicable Law, then the effective
annual rate of interest, as so determined, received or to be received by the Lender on such amount of credit 
  33 



advanced shall be and be deemed to be adjusted to a rate that is one whole percentage point less than the lowest effective annual rate of interest that is so prohibited (the adjusted
rate); and, if the Lender has received a payment or partial payment which would, but for this Section 5.8, be so prohibited then any amount or amounts so received by the Lender in excess of the adjusted rate shall be deemed to have
comprised a credit to be applied to subsequent payments on account of interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lender at the adjusted rate or shall be paid to the Borrower if no further interest, fees or other amounts are or will become due to the
Lender.  5.9 Interest Act  Whenever a
rate of interest hereunder is calculated on the basis of a year (the deemed year) which contains fewer days than the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation, such rate of interest shall be expressed as a yearly
rate for purposes of the Interest Act (Canada) by multiplying such rate of interest by the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation and dividing it by the number of days in the deemed year. 
5.10 Waivers  To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, any provision of the Interest Act (Canada) or the Judgment Interest Act (Alberta) which restricts any rate of interest set forth herein shall be inapplicable to this Agreement and is hereby waived by each Loan Party.
 ARTICLE 6  PAYMENT
AND TAXES  6.1 Time, Place and Currency of Payment 
Payments of principal, interest, fees and all other amounts payable by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid in Dollars at or
before 11:00 a.m. on the day such payment is due. If any such day is not a Business Day or a Banking Day, as applicable, such amount shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to be due on the Business Day or Banking Day next following such
day and any such extension of time shall be included in the computation of the payment of any interest or fees payable under this Agreement unless such extension of time is included in a successive period for which interest is payable hereunder.
Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, all payments required to be made by the Borrower or a Lender shall be made to the Agents Applicable Account for Payments. Receipt by the Agent from the Borrower of funds pursuant to this
Agreement, as principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be deemed to be receipt of such funds by the Agent or Lenders, as the case may be.  6.2
Application of Payments Prior to an Event of Default  Except as otherwise agreed to by all of the Lenders in their sole discretion, but
subject to Section 4.4, all payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement prior to the delivery of an Acceleration Notice shall be applied by the Agent ratably, among the Lenders and the Agent in accordance with
amounts owed to the Lenders and the Agent in respect of each category of amounts set forth below, each such application to be made in the following order with the balance remaining after application in respect of each category to be applied to the
next succeeding category: 
  34 




(a)
Expenses: firstly, in payment of any amounts due and payable as and by way of recoverable expenses hereunder;   


(b)
Agents Fees: secondly, in payment of any amounts due and payable as and by way of the Agents fees referred to in Section 5.7; 
 


(c)
Commitment Fees: thirdly, in payment of any amounts due and payable as and by way of the Commitment Fees referred to in Section 5.5; 
 


(d)
Interest: fourthly, in payment of any amounts due and payable as and by way of interest pursuant to Sections 5.1 and 5.3, and interest on overdue amounts pursuant to Section 5.4; and 
 


(e)
Other Amounts (other than Borrowings): fifthly, in payment of any amounts (other than Borrowings) then due and payable by the Borrower hereunder other than amounts hereinbefore referred to in this
Section 6.2;  with the balance to be applied to repay or otherwise reduce Borrowings in a manner so that the Borrowings
outstanding hereunder will, to the extent possible but subject to Section 3.7(a), be outstanding or in the same proportion as the Lenders Proportion of such Borrowings. 
6.3 Taxes   


(a)
 Withholding: Each Loan Party agrees that any and all payments by such Loan Party to or for the benefit of
the Lenders shall be, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law or expressly provided in this Section 6.3, free and clear of and without set-off, counterclaim, reduction or deduction for any and all
present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) taxes imposed on such Lenders income or such Lenders capital, and franchise taxes imposed on such
Lender, (ii) taxes imposed with respect to such payments by the United States or any political subdivision thereof, or any other jurisdiction or country which taxes are imposed by reason of such Lender being resident in the United States or
such other country or carrying on business in, or maintaining a permanent establishment or fixed base in, the United States or such other country, unless such residence, business, permanent establishment or fixed base arises solely by reason of a
Borrowing hereunder or any other right under this Agreement or the receipt of any payment on or with respect to any Borrowing from such Lender and (iii) any U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed under FATCA (all such excluded taxes referred to
in this Section 6.3 being referred to herein as Excluded Taxes and all such other taxes (other than Excluded Taxes), levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being referred to herein as
Taxes). If a Loan Party shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that, after making
all required deductions or withholdings (including deductions applicable to additional sums 
  35 




 

payable under this Section 6.3), such Lender has received an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall
make such deductions or withholdings, and (iii) such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with Applicable Law. Excluded Taxes shall
include, in the case of any Foreign Lender, any United States withholding Tax that is imposed on amounts payable to such Foreign Lender at the time such Foreign Lender becomes a party hereto (or designates a new lending office) or is attributable to
such Foreign Lenders failure or inability (other than as a result of a change in law) to comply with Section 6.3(d), except to the extent that such Foreign Lender (or its assignor, if any) was entitled, at the time of designation of a new
lending office (or assignment), to receive additional amounts from a Loan Party with respect to such withholding Tax pursuant to Section 6.3(a).   


(b)
Refunds: If any Taxes are imposed on or with respect to any payment on or under this Agreement, in consequence of which a Loan Party is required to make any additional payment to any Lender under this
Section 6.3, and if such Lender is entitled to a refund (or a credit in lieu of a refund) which is both identifiable and quantifiable by such Lender as being attributable to the imposition of such Taxes (a Tax Refund), and
such Tax Refund may be obtained without increased liability to such Lender by filing one or more forms, certificates, documents, applications or returns (collectively, the Forms), then such Lender shall within a reasonable time
after receiving a written request from such Loan Party (which request shall specify in reasonable detail the Forms to be filed and explain the actions necessary to obtain such Tax Refund), file such Forms. If such Lender subsequently receives a Tax
Refund, and such Lender is able to identify the Tax Refund as being attributable, in whole or in part, to the tax with respect to which such additional payment was made, then such Lender shall reimburse the applicable Loan Party such amount as such
Lender shall determine acting in good faith to be the proportion of the Tax Refund, together with any interest received thereon, attributable to such additional payment as will leave such Lender after the reimbursement in the same position as it
would have been if the additional payment had not been required; provided that, if any Tax Refund reimbursed by a Lender to a Loan Party is subsequently disallowed, such Loan Party shall repay such Lender such amount (together with interest and any
applicable penalty payable by such Lender to the relevant taxing authority) promptly after receipt of notice by such Lender of such disallowance. Each Loan Party agrees to reimburse each such Lender for such Lenders reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, if any, incurred in complying with any request hereunder and agrees that all costs incurred by such Lender in respect of this Section 6.3 may be
deducted from the amount of any reimbursement to such Loan Party in respect of any Tax Refund pursuant to this Section 6.3.   


(c)
 Cooperation: In the event that a Loan Party makes any indemnification payment to a Lender under this
Section 6.3 and in the event such Lender determines in its good faith judgment that it is not liable for the Taxes for which such indemnification payment was made, such Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with such Loan Party
in contesting the liability for such Taxes; provided that, such Loan Party shall reimburse such Lender for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
providing such cooperation and shall indemnify and hold such Lender harmless from and against 
  36 




 

any liabilities incurred as a result of such Lender providing such cooperation or contesting such liability, and provided further that no such cooperation shall be required if such contest shall
in such Lenders good faith judgment subject it to any liability not covered by such indemnity.   


(d)
Tax Forms. (i) Each Lender that is a U.S. Person, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender that is a U.S. Person and on the date of the
Lender Transfer Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender that is a U.S. Person, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Lender remains
lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the Agent and the Borrower, executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding.
  


 
(ii)
Each Foreign Lender, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and on the date of the Lender Transfer Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in
the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the Agent and the Borrower with the number of
original copies requested by the recipient of any required forms, certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding Tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement (including Internal Revenue Service
Forms W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, or, in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming exemption
from U.S. federal withholding Tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of portfolio interest, both a Form W-8BEN and a certificate to the effect that such Foreign
Lender is not (1) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (3) a
controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code). To the extent that a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner of any payments pursuant to this Agreement, such Foreign Lender shall deliver the number of
original copies requested by the recipient of Internal Revenue Service form W-8IMY, accompanied by original Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable. 
 


(e)
Mitigation. Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.3 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to
change the jurisdiction of its Branch of Account if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.   


(f)
 FATCA. If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding
Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply 
  37 



with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent
at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional
documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under
FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.    Solely for purposes of this clause (f), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

(o)
Restriction on Amalgamation etc.: TCPL shall not, and shall not permit the Borrower to, enter into any transaction whereby all or substantially all of its undertaking, property and assets would become the

(i)
the successor company shall execute, prior to or contemporaneously with the consummation of such transaction such agreements together with such other instruments as are satisfactory to the Majority Lenders, acting
reasonably, and in the opinion of counsel to the Agent, acting reasonably, necessary or advisable to evidence the assumption by the successor company of the indebtedness and other obligations of such Loan Party under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents and to observe and perform all the covenants and obligations of such Loan Party under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (unless the successor company is bound thereby by operation of law without the need for any such
assumption agreement as confirmed by counsel for the Agent acting reasonably);   


 
(ii)
such transaction shall be upon such terms as shall be necessary to substantially preserve and not impair any of the rights and powers of the Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, as
determined by either the board of directors or one or more of the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer or the general counsel of TCPL, acting reasonably and in good faith, in the case of a transaction wholly with or among, as
applicable, TCPL and one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, and in any other case, as determined by the Majority Lenders and counsel to the Agent, each acting reasonably; 
  44

(i)
any material change reports which it files with any securities regulatory authorities or stock exchange forthwith upon provision of the same to such regulatory authority or stock exchange, unless such material change

(ii)
such information and documents as it provides to its shareholders at the same time it provides such information and documents to its shareholders; and 
 


 
(iii)
such other information and documents as are normally made available by TCPLs investor relations officers to shareholders and which are from time to time requested by the Agent; 
provided, that if and for so long as TCPL is a reporting issuer under the Securities Act (Alberta) or
successor legislation thereto, the documents required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 8.1(p) (to the extent any such documents are included in materials otherwise filed with TCPLs provincial securities regulator) may be delivered

rating of the long term unsecured and unsubordinated debt of TCPL.   


(s)
Further Assurances: TCPL shall do and cause the Borrower to do all such further acts and things and execute and deliver all such further documents as shall be reasonably required by the Agent in order to ensure
the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are fully performed and carried out.

representation or warranty (if capable of being corrected) continues to be incorrect for a period of thirty (30) days after the Agent gives written notice of such incorrect representation and warranty to the applicable Loan Party or, if such
representation and warranty is not capable of being remedied, the true facts as they exist would be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect (as determined by the Majority Lenders acting reasonably); 
  48

(l)
ERISA: the Borrower or any of its ERISA Affiliates shall incur liability aggregating in excess of the greater of (i) Cdn. $100,000,000 or (ii) two and one half percent (2.5%) of the Consolidated
Shareholders Equity of TCPL or the equivalent amount of (i) or (ii) above (as applicable) in any other currency as a result of one or more of the following: (i) the occurrence of any ERISA Event; (ii) the partial or complete
withdrawal of the Borrower or any of its ERISA Affiliates from a Multiemployer Plan; or (iii) the reorganization or termination of a Multiemployer Plan;

(n)
Guarantor Default: any provision of Article 13 shall for any reason cease to be valid and binding on or enforceable against TCPL, or TCPL shall so state in writing. 
9.2     Acceleration 
(a)    Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default which has not been remedied or waived, the Agent may on behalf of the
Lenders and shall if so required by the Majority Lenders by written notice to the Borrower (an Acceleration Notice):   


 
(i)
declare the Total Commitment and each Lenders Commitment and the right of the Borrower to apply for further Borrowings to be terminated; and 
 


 
(ii)
declare all indebtedness and liabilities (whether matured or unmatured) of the Borrower outstanding to the Lenders hereunder to be immediately due and payable (or to be due and payable at such later time as may be
stated in such notice) without further demand, presentation, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by the Borrower. 
  49 


At the time stated in an Acceleration Notice, the Borrower shall pay to the Agent on behalf of
each Lender all amounts owing or payable in respect of all indebtedness and liabilities specified in Section 9.2(b) failing which all rights and remedies of the Lenders and the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall thereupon
become enforceable.  (b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order for
relief with respect to the Borrower under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (A) the Total Commitment and each Lenders Commitment and the right of the Borrower to apply for further Borrowings shall automatically be terminated and (B) all
indebtedness and liabilities (whether matured or unmatured) of the Borrower outstanding to the Lenders hereunder shall automatically become and be due and payable, without further demand, presentation, protest or other notice of any kind, all of
which are expressly waived by the Borrower.  9.3     Waiver of Default 
Any single or partial exercise by any Lender, the Agent or by the Agent on behalf of any Lender of any right or remedy for a default or breach
of any term, covenant, condition or agreement contained in the Loan Documents shall not be deemed to be a waiver of or to alter, affect or prejudice any other right or remedy to which the Agent or such Lender may be lawfully entitled for the same
default or breach, and any waiver by any Lender, the Agent or by the Agent on behalf of any Lender of the strict observance, performance or compliance with any term, covenant, condition or agreement contained in the Loan Documents, and any
indulgence granted thereby, shall be deemed not to be a waiver of any subsequent default. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Borrower hereby waives any rights now or hereafter conferred by statute or otherwise which are inconsistent with
the Agents or a Lenders rights or remedies under the Loan Documents.  9.4     Application and Sharing of Payments
Following Acceleration  Except as otherwise agreed to by all of the Lenders in their sole discretion, any sum received by the Agent at
any time after delivery of an Acceleration Notice or the occurrence of an event described in Section 9.2(b) which the Agent is obliged to apply in or towards satisfaction of sums due from the Borrower hereunder shall be applied by the Agent ratably
among the Lenders and the Agent in accordance with amounts owed to the Lenders and the Agent in respect of each category of amounts set forth below, each such application to be made in the following order with the balance remaining after application
in respect of each category to be applied to the next succeeding category:   


(a)
Agents Fees: firstly, in or towards payment of any fees then due and payable to the Agent hereunder, including, without limitation, those fees payable pursuant to Section 5.7; 
 


(b)
Agents Expenses: secondly, ratably among the Agent and the Lenders in accordance with amounts owed to the Agent and the Lenders in respect of amounts due and payable as and by way of recoverable expenses
hereunder;   


(c)
Interest and Fees: thirdly, ratably among the Lenders in accordance with amounts owed to the Lenders in respect of amounts due and payable as and by way of interest pursuant to Sections 5.1 and 5.3, interest on
overdue amounts pursuant to Section 5.4 and Commitment Fees pursuant to Section 5.5; 
  50 




(d)
Other Amounts (other than Borrowings): fourthly, ratably among the Lenders in accordance with amounts owed to the Lenders in respect of any amount (other than Borrowings) then due and payable by the Borrower
hereunder other than amounts hereinbefore referred to in this Section 9.4; and   


(e)
Borrowings: fifthly, in or towards repayment to the Lenders of the Borrowings then outstanding hereunder in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.11. 
9.5     Remedies Cumulative 
The rights and remedies of the Agent and each Lender under the Loan Documents are cumulative and are in addition to and not in substitution for
any rights or remedies provided by law. The Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and shall if so required by the Majority Lenders, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, bring suit at law, in equity or otherwise for any available relief or purpose
including but not limited to:   


(a)
the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in the Loan Documents;   


(b)
enjoining a violation of any of the terms of the Loan Documents;   


(c)
aiding in the exercise of any power granted by the Loan Documents or by law; or   


(d)
obtaining and recovering judgment for any and all amounts due in respect of the Borrowings or amounts otherwise due hereunder or under the Loan Documents. 
9.6     Set-Off 
In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under Applicable Law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, the Agent and the
Lenders are authorized at any time after the delivery of an Acceleration Notice to the Borrower or the occurrence of an event described in Section 9.2(b) and from time to time thereafter, without notice to any Loan Party or to any other Person, any
such notice being expressly waived by each Loan Party, to set-off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general and special) and any other indebtedness at any time held by or owing by the Agent
or such Lender or any of their respective Affiliates to or for the credit of or the account of any Loan Party against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of such Loan Party to the Agent or such Lender under this Agreement, including
without limitation, all claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this Agreement, and although such obligations, liabilities or claims of such Loan Party are contingent or unmatured. Each Lender agrees to notify the
Borrower and the Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 
  51 


9.7     Lenders May Perform Covenants 
If any Loan Party shall fail to perform any of its obligations under any covenant contained in any of the Loan Documents within the time
permitted for the performance of any such covenant or for the cure of any default thereof, the Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, on the instructions of the Majority Lenders and after notice to such Loan Party and after providing such Loan Party
with a reasonable opportunity to object to such payment on the basis that the obligation underlying the covenant is being disputed in good faith by such Loan Party (in which case no payment shall be made by the Agent pursuant to this
Section 9.7 unless failure to make such payment would result in a Material Adverse Effect), perform any such covenant capable of being performed by it and, if any such covenant requires the payment or expenditure of money, it may make such
payment or expenditure with its own funds on behalf of the Lenders. All amounts so paid by the Agent hereunder shall be repaid by the applicable Loan Party on demand therefor, and shall bear interest at the rate set forth in Section 5.4 from
and including the date paid by the Agent hereunder to but excluding the date such amounts are repaid in full by such Loan Party. 
ARTICLE 10  EXPENSES AND
INDEMNITIES  10.1     Reimbursement of Expenses 
All statements, reports, opinions and other documents or information required to be furnished to the Agent (for its benefit or for the benefit
of the Lenders) by TCPL under this Agreement shall be supplied by TCPL without cost to the Agent or the Lenders and in sufficient quantities for distribution to the Agent and the Lenders. In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay promptly to the Agent
on demand:   


(a)
all reasonable and documented legal fees of outside counsel approved by TCPL and other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses
which are incurred from time to time by the Agent in respect of the documentation, preparation, registration, negotiation, execution and administration of the Loan Documents; and 
 


(b)
all reasonable and documented legal fees and other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses which are incurred from time to time by
the Agent or the Lenders in respect of the enforcement of the Loan Documents against any Loan Party, except with respect to the Agent to the extent such legal fees or other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders in respect of the enforcement of the Loan Documents against any Loan Party are incurred as a result
of the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Agent.  10.2     Increased Cost 
If, after the date hereof (or with respect to any Lender, if later, the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender), the introduction of, any
change in or the implementation of any applicable law, regulation, treaty, official directive or regulatory requirement now or hereafter in effect (whether or not having the force of law) or any change in the interpretation or application thereof by
any court or by any judicial or Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or if compliance by any Lender with any request from any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority (whether or not
having the force of law) (individually, a Circumstance): 
  52 




(a)
subjects a Lender to any Tax, or changes the basis of taxation of payments due to a Lender or increases any existing Tax, on payments of principal, interest or other amounts payable by any Loan Party to a Lender under
this Agreement (excluding for purposes of this Section 10.2 any Taxes which are covered by Section 6.3);   


(b)
imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit, capital adequacy, liquidity, regulatory or similar requirement against assets or liabilities held by a Lender, or deposits of or for the account of a
Lender, or loans by a Lender, or any other acquisition of funds for loans by a Lender or commitments by a Lender to fund loans; or   


(c)
imposes on a Lender any other condition with respect to this Agreement;  and the result thereof
in the sole determination of such Lender acting reasonably and in good faith, is to increase the cost to such Lender or to reduce the income or return receivable by such Lender in respect of any Borrowing or Commitment Fees payable pursuant to
Section 5.5 or in respect of such Lenders commitment to lend hereunder, such Lender shall promptly notify the Agent. The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the benefit of such Lender that
amount which compensates such Lender for such additional cost or reduction in income (except to the extent such increase in costs or reduction in income is reflected in or recovered by an increase in the Base Rate) (Additional
Compensation) on the next Interest Date or other date for the payment of interest falling no earlier than ten (10) Business Days after such notice shall have been given by the Agent to the Borrower (and each successive applicable
Interest Date or other date, if applicable) unless such Lender knew, on the date of execution of this Agreement, of such Circumstance and the likely result thereof; provided, however, that before making any such demand, each Lender agrees to use
reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Branch of Account if the making of such designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost and
would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower shall not be obligated to
pay any portion of such Additional Compensation accruing under this Section 10.2 for any period prior to the date that is three months prior to the date on which the Agent, on behalf of such Lender, gives notice to the Borrower that such
Additional Compensation is so accruing. A certificate by a duly authorized officer of such Lender (prepared in good faith) setting forth the amount of the Additional Compensation and the basis for it must be submitted by the Agent to the Borrower
and is prima facie evidence of the amount of the Additional Compensation. If the Agent notifies the Borrower that Additional Compensation is owed, the Borrower shall have the right to make payment in full to the Agent for the account of such
Lender in respect of the applicable Borrowing together with accrued but unpaid interest and fees in respect of such Borrowing and such other amounts as may be required hereunder to the date of payment or to convert such Borrowing into another basis
of Borrowing available under this Agreement upon written notice given no later than the third Business Day preceding such payment date or conversion date to the 
  53 



Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for a Lender to require the payment of Additional Compensation from the Borrower, the Circumstance giving rise to such Additional Compensation must
result in increased costs to the Lender generally in respect of similar type borrowers as the Borrower and any claims resulting from such increased costs must be pursued by such Lender using reasonable commercial efforts as against such similar type
borrowers, except where such Lender is restricted by agreement or law from any such pursuit.  For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for the purposes of this Section 10.2, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, regulations, guidelines, interpretations or directives thereunder
or issued in connection therewith (whether or not having the force of law) and (y) all requests, rules, regulations, guidelines, interpretations or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (or any successor or similar authority ) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities (whether or not having the force of law), in case for this clause (y) pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a change
in law regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued, promulgated or implemented.  10.3     Illegality 
If the introduction of or any change in Applicable Law, regulation, treaty, official directive or regulatory requirement now or hereafter in
effect (whether or not having the force of law) or any change in the interpretation or application thereof by any court or by any judicial or Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, makes it unlawful or
prohibited for a Lender to make, to fund or to maintain the Borrowings or a portion of the Borrowings or to perform its obligations under this Agreement, such Lender may by written notice to the Borrower through the Agent terminate its obligations
under this Agreement to make such Borrowings or perform such obligations and the Borrower shall prepay such Borrowings within ten (10) Business Days of written notice requesting such prepayment given by the Agent to the Borrower together with
all accrued but unpaid interest and fees and other amounts hereunder as may be required hereunder to the date of payment or convert by notice to the Agent such Borrowings into another basis of Borrowing available under this Agreement within the time
required by any such law, regulation, treaty, official directive or regulatory requirement.  Each Lender shall use its reasonable
commercial efforts to advise the Agent, who shall in turn advise the Borrower, of any proposed introduction or change in any applicable law, regulation, treaty, official directive or regulatory requirement which would make it unlawful or prohibited
for a Lender to make, fund or maintain any Borrowing hereunder or to perform its obligations hereunder. If a Lender is affected by this Section 10.3, it shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to take such action as will avoid the need to
exercise its rights under this Section 10.3 but only if such action will not, in the sole opinion of such Lender exercised in good faith, be disadvantageous to such Lender or require such Lender to incur any additional costs. 
10.4     Substitute Basis of Borrowing 
If, on or prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Banking Day prior to any Interest Determination Date in respect of a Libor Loan, a Lender determines
(acting reasonably and in good faith) that: 
  54 




(a)
adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the rate of interest on such Libor Loan;   


(b)
the making or the continuation of such Libor Loan or a portion of such Libor Loan by such Lender has become impracticable by reason of circumstances which materially and adversely affect the London interbank market;
  


(c)
deposits in Dollars are not available to such Lender in the London interbank market in sufficient amounts in the ordinary course of business for the applicable Interest Period to make, fund or maintain such Libor Loan
during such Interest Period; or   


(d)
Libor for any Interest Period will not adequately reflect the cost to such Lender of making, funding or maintaining its Libor Loans for such Interest Period, 
then such Lender shall promptly notify the Agent, and the Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders in writing of such
determination setting forth the basis of such determination and the Lenders shall not be obligated to provide such Libor Loan for so long as such event or condition exists and such requested Libor Loan shall be made as a Base Rate Loan. 
10.5     Funding Indemnity 
If, for any reason whatsoever and whether or not required or permitted pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrower repays,
prepays, converts or cancels a Libor Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable to such Libor Loan, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender for any cost or expense reasonably incurred by such Lender including, without
limitation, any cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to maintain the Libor Loan or any increased interest or other charges payable to lenders of funds borrowed in
order to maintain such Libor Loan together with any other out-of-pocket charges, costs or expenses incurred by such Lender relative thereto which would not have been
incurred but for such repayment, prepayment, conversion or cancellation by the Borrower other than on the last day of the applicable Interest Period. A certificate of such Lender (acting reasonably and prepared in good faith) submitted by the Agent
setting out the basis for the determination of the amount necessary to indemnify such Lender shall be prima facie evidence thereof.  10.6
    General Indemnity  The Borrower hereby covenants with each Agent and each Lender that it shall at all times
hereafter keep the Agent, such Lender and their respective affiliates and their directors, officers, employees and agents (each, an Indemnified Party) indemnified and held harmless from and against all suits (whether founded or
unfounded), actions, proceedings, judgments, demands or claims instituted or made against such Indemnified Party (Proceedings), and all costs, losses, liabilities, damages and reasonable and documented expenses (including all
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by such Indemnified Party in any way relating to, arising out of, or incidental to any Environmental Laws or any default by any Loan Party under any provision of any of the Loan
Documents except to the extent any of the foregoing result (a) from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such 
  55 



Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction or (b) from any Proceeding
that does not involve an act or omission of TCPL, the Borrower or any of TCPLs Subsidiaries and that is brought by an Indemnified Party against any other Indemnified Party, other than claims against JPMCB in its capacity as an agent or
arranger with respect to this Agreement. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 10.6 applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by the Borrower, its directors, equityholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person, whether or not any Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated. Each Loan Party also agrees not to assert any claim for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages against the Agent, any Lender, any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
attorneys and agents, on any theory of liability, arising out of or otherwise relating to this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans. In case any
proceeding shall be instituted involving any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 10.6, the applicable Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Borrower in writing (but failure to do so shall not
relieve the Borrower from any liability which it may have pursuant to this Section 10.6) and the Borrower, upon request of the Indemnified Party, shall retain counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably, to represent the
Indemnified Party and any others the Borrower may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless:   


(a)
the Borrower and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel; or   


(b)
the named parties to any such proceeding include the Borrower and the Indemnified Party and any other parties in respect of which the Borrower has provided a similar indemnity and representation of such parties by the
same counsel, in the reasonable judgment of such Indemnified Party, would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. 
ARTICLE 11  THE AGENT
AND THE LENDERS  11.1     Authorization of Agent 
Each Lender irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to exercise such powers, perform such duties, take such actions, make such decisions
and determinations and give such consents under the Loan Documents as may be permitted or as are required to be exercised, performed, taken, made, given or otherwise carried out by the Agent hereunder or under any other agreement between the
Lenders, together with all powers reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly required by this Agreement or by any other agreement between the Lenders to be carried out by the Agent, the Agent is not required to exercise any
discretion or take or to refrain from taking any action except upon the written instructions of the Majority 
  56 



Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or to take or to refrain from taking any action in any manner which
is contrary to the Loan Documents, to any other agreement between the Lenders or to Applicable Law.  11.2     Responsibility
  


(a)
The Agents duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are solely ministerial and administrative in nature and the Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and
in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, but shall be required to act or refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the written direction of the Majority Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided
that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent or any of its Affiliates to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or Applicable Law. 
 


(b)
The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Majority Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as
the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 11.12) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of
any Event of Default or the event or events that give or may give rise to any Event of Default unless and until the Borrower or any Lender shall have given notice to the Agent describing such Event of Default and such event or events.
  


(c)
Neither the Agent nor any member of the Agents Group shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty, representation or other information made or supplied in
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith or the adequacy, accuracy and/or
completeness of the information contained therein, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Event of Default, (iv) the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or the perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created hereby
or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 7 or elsewhere herein, other than (but subject to the foregoing clause (ii)) to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Agent. 
 


(d)
Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall require the Agent or any of its Related Parties to carry out any know your customer or other checks in relation to any Person on behalf of
any Lender and each Lender confirms to the Agent that it is solely responsible for any such checks it is required to carry out and that it may not rely on any statement in relation to such checks made by the Agent or any of its Related Parties.

  57 


11.3 Acknowledgment of Lenders   


(a)
Each Lender confirms to the Agent, each other Lender and each of their respective Related Parties that it (i) possesses (individually or through its Related Parties) such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters that it is capable, without reliance on the Agent, any other Lender or any of their respective Related Parties, of evaluating the merits and risks (including tax, legal, regulatory, credit, accounting and other financial matters) of
(x) entering into this Agreement, (y) making Loans and other extensions of credit hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (z) in taking or not taking actions hereunder and thereunder, (ii) is financially able to bear
such risks and (iii) has determined that entering into this Agreement and making Loans and other extensions of credit hereunder and under the other Loan Documents is suitable and appropriate for it. 
 


(b)
Each Lender acknowledges that (x) it is solely responsible for making its own independent appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
(y) it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Lender or any of their respective Related Parties, made its own appraisal and investigation of all risks associated with, and its own credit analysis and decision to enter
into, this Agreement based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate and (z) it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Lender or any of their respective Related Parties, continue to be solely
responsible for making its own appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with, and its own credit analysis and decision to take or not take action under, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents based on such
documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, which may include, in each case:   


 
(i)
the financial condition, status and capitalization of the Borrower and each other Loan Party;   


 
(ii)
the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under
or in connection with any Loan Document;   


 
(iii)
determining compliance or non-compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan and the form and substance of all evidence delivered in connection with establishing
the satisfaction of each such condition;   


 
(iv)
the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of any information delivered by the Agent, any other Lender or by any of their respective Related Parties under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Loan Document. 
  58 


11.4     Rights and Obligations of Each Lender 
The rights and obligations of each Lender under this Agreement are several and no Lender shall be obligated to make Borrowings available to the
Borrower in excess of the amount of such Lenders Commitment(s). The failure of a Lender to perform its obligations under this Agreement shall neither:   


(a)
result in any other Lender incurring any liability for such failure; nor   


(b)
relieve the Borrower or any other Lender from their respective obligations under any Loan Document. 
Nothing contained herein or in any other Loan Document nor any action taken pursuant hereto or thereto shall be deemed to constitute the
Lenders a partnership, joint venture or any other similar entity.  11.5     Determinations by Lenders 
 


(a)
Where the provisions of this Agreement provide that any waiver of or any amendment to any provision of the Loan Documents may be made or any action, consent or other determination in connection with the Loan Documents
may be taken or given, with the consent or agreement of the Majority Lenders, then any such waiver, amendment, action, consent or determination so made, so taken or so given with the consent or agreement of the Majority Lenders shall be binding on
all of the Lenders and all of the Lenders shall cooperate in all ways necessary or desirable to implement and effect such waiver, amendment, action, consent or determination. 
 


(b)
Unless otherwise specifically dealt with in this Agreement or in the written notice from the Agent, in the event the Agent delivers a written notice to a Lender requesting advice from such Lender as to whether it
consents or objects to any matter in connection with the Loan Documents, then, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, if such Lender does not deliver to the Agent its written consent or objection to such matter within twenty
(20) Business Days of the delivery of such written notice by the Agent to such Lender, such Lender shall be deemed not to have consented thereto upon the expiry of such twenty (20) Business Day period. 
11.6     Notices  All
notices by the Lenders to the Agent shall be through the Agents Branch of Account and all notices by the Agent to a Lender shall be through such Lenders Branch of Account. All notices or communications between the Borrower and the
Lenders which are required or contemplated pursuant to the Loan Documents shall be given or made through the Agent at the Agents Branch of Account. 
  59 


11.7 Duty to Deliver Documents Obtained from the Loan Parties 
The Agent shall promptly deliver to each Lender, at its Branch of Account, such documents, papers, materials and other information as are
furnished by each Loan Party to the Agent on behalf of such Lender pursuant to this Agreement, and each Loan Party shall provide the Agent with sufficient copies of all such information for such purpose. 
11.8 Arrangements for Borrowings  The
Agent shall promptly give written notice to each Lender at its Branch of Account upon receipt by the Agent of any notice given pursuant to Section 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, 3.12 or 4.2. The Agent shall advise each Lender of the amount,
date and details of each Borrowing and of such Lenders share in each Borrowing. At or before 1:00 p.m. on each Drawdown Date, Conversion Date or Rollover Date, each Lender will make its share of Borrowings by forwarding to the Agent the amount
of Loans required to be made available by such Lender and the Agent, upon receipt thereof, shall forthwith make the same available to the Borrower at the account of the Borrower as advised by the Borrower to the Agent from time to time. 
11.9 Arrangements for Repayment of Borrowings   


(a)
Prior to the delivery of an Acceleration Notice or the occurrence of an event described in Section 9.2(b), upon receipt by the Agent of payments from the Borrower on account of principal, interest, fees or any other
payment made to the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, the Agent shall pay over to each Lender at its Branch of Account the amount to which it is entitled under this Agreement and shall use its best efforts to make such payment to such Lender on the
same Business Day on which such payment is received by the Agent.   


(b)
Following delivery of an Acceleration Notice or the occurrence of an event described in Section 9.2(b), the Lenders shall share any payments subsequently received in accordance with Section 9.4 of this Agreement.
 11.10 Repayment by Lenders to Agent   


(a)
Unless the Agent has been notified in writing by the Borrower no later than the Business Day prior to the date on which any payment to be made by the Borrower hereunder is due that the Borrower does not intend to remit
such payment, the Agent may, in its discretion, assume that the Borrower has remitted such payment when so due and the Agent may, in its discretion and in reliance upon such assumption, make available to each Lender on such payment date an amount
equal to the amount of such payment which is due to such Lender pursuant to this Agreement. If the Borrower does not in fact remit such payment to the Agent, the Agent shall promptly notify each Lender and each such Lender shall forthwith on demand
repay to the Agent the amount of such assumed payment made available to such Lender, together with interest thereon until the date of repayment thereof at a rate determined by the Agent (such rate to be conclusive and binding on such Lender) in
accordance with the Agents usual banking practice for similar advances to financial institutions of like standing to such Lender. 
  60 




(b)
Unless the Agent has been notified in writing by a Lender no later than the Business Day prior to a Drawdown Date or Conversion Date that such Lender does not intend to make available the amount required to be made
available by such Lender pursuant to this Agreement on such Drawdown Date or Conversion Date, the Agent may, in its discretion, assume that such Lender has remitted funds to the Agent in an amount equal to the amount required to be made available by
such Lender pursuant to this Agreement and the Agent may, in its discretion and in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such Drawdown Date or Conversion Date an amount equal to the amount required to be made available by
such Lender pursuant to this Agreement. If a Lender does not in fact remit such funds to the Agent, the Agent shall promptly notify such Lender and such Lender shall forthwith remit such funds to the Agent, failing which the Borrower shall forthwith
on demand repay to the Agent (without prejudice to the Borrowers rights against such Lender) the amount made available by the Agent on behalf of such Lender, in each case together with interest thereon until the date of repayment thereof at a
rate determined by the Agent (such rate to be conclusive and binding on such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be) in accordance with the Agents usual banking practice for similar advances to financial institutions of like standing to
such Lender.  11.11 Adjustments Among Lenders   


(a)
Each Lender agrees that, after delivery of an Acceleration Notice or the occurrence of an event described in Section 9.2(b), it will at any time and from time to time upon the request of the Agent as required by any
Lender, purchase portions of the Borrowings made available by the other Lenders which remain outstanding and make any other adjustments which may be necessary in order that the amount of Borrowings made available by each Lender which remain
outstanding, as adjusted pursuant to this Section 11.11, will be in the same proportion as the Lenders Proportion of such Borrowings.   


(b)
The Lenders agree that, after delivery of an Acceleration Notice or the occurrence of an event described in Section 9.2(b), the amount of any repayment made by the Borrower in respect of Borrowings under this Agreement,
and the amount of any proceeds from the exercise of any rights or remedies of the Lenders under the Loan Documents, which are to be applied against amounts owing hereunder, will be so applied in a manner so that to the extent possible the amount of
Borrowings made available by each Lender which remain outstanding after giving effect to such application will be in the same proportion as the Lenders Proportion of such Borrowings. 
 


(c)
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 11.11, there shall not be taken into account for the purposes of computing any amount payable to any Lender pursuant to this Section 11.11, any amount which a
Lender receives as a result of any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of any monies owing by the Borrower to such Lender other than
on account of liabilities arising under the Loan Documents; provided that, if at any time a Lender receives any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or
otherwise) on account of monies owing or payable to it by the Borrower in respect of liabilities of the Borrower arising under the Loan Documents, such Lender shall purchase portions of the applicable Borrowings made available by the other Lenders
which remain outstanding to the extent required pursuant to Section 11.11(a). 
  61 




(d)
The Borrower agrees to be bound by and, at the request of the Agent, to do all things necessary or appropriate to give effect to any and all purchases and other adjustments made by and between the Lenders pursuant to
this Section 11.11 but shall incur no increased liabilities, in aggregate, by reason thereof.   


(e)
All obligations of Lenders pursuant to this Section 11.11 shall be limited to the extent that any Lender would be required to purchase any portions of Borrowings in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount
of Loans made by such Lender, would exceed such Lenders Commitment.  11.12 Lenders Consents to Waivers, Amendments, etc.
  


(a)
Any waiver of or any amendment to a provision of the Loan Documents which relates to:   


 
(i)
a change in the definition of Majority Lenders;   


 
(ii)
any matter which, pursuant to the Loan Documents, specifically requires the consent or agreement of all of the Lenders rather than the consent or agreement of the Lenders; 
 


 
(iii)
any release of the Guarantor from its obligations under Section 13.1; or   


 
(iv)
the provisions of this Section 11.12(a);  shall bind the Lenders only if such waiver or
amendment is agreed to in writing by all of the Lenders. No provision of this Agreement may be waived, amended or modified if the effect of such waiver, amendment or modification would (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the
written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby or
(iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of
any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby.   


(b)
Majority Consent: Subject to Section 11.12(a) and except as otherwise provided in the Loan Documents, any waiver of or any amendment to any provision of the Loan Documents and any action, consent or other
determination in connection with the Loan Documents shall bind all of the Lenders if such waiver, amendment, action, consent or other determination is agreed to in writing by the Majority Lenders. 
 


(c)
Agents Consent: Any waiver of or any amendment to any provision of the Loan Documents which relates to the rights or obligations of the Agent in such capacity shall require the agreement of the Agent
thereto. 
  62 


11.13 Reimbursement of Expenses 
Each Lender agrees that it will indemnify the Agent for its Lenders Proportion of any and all costs, expenses and disbursements
(including, without limitation, those costs and expenses referred to in Section 9.7 and 10.1) which may be incurred or made by the Agent in good faith in connection with the Loan Documents, and agrees that it will, on written demand detailing
such costs, expenses and disbursements, reimburse the Agent for any such costs, expenses or disbursements for which the Agent is not promptly reimbursed at any time by the Borrower, except to the extent such costs, expenses or disbursements are
incurred as a result of the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Agent. The Agent may refrain from exercising any right, power or discretion or taking any action to protect or enforce the rights of any Lender under the Loan
Documents until it has been so reimbursed.  11.14 Reliance on Notices, etc. 
The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper
Person. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition
hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless an officer of the Agent responsible for the transactions
contemplated hereby shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan, and such Lender shall not have made available to the Agent such Lenders ratable portion of the applicable Borrowing. The Agent
may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower or any other Loan Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of
any such counsel, accountants or experts.  11.15 Relations with Loan Parties 
 


(a)
The Person serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent and the term Lender
or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with TCPL or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Agent hereunder and without any duty to
account therefor to the Lenders.   


(b)
 Each Lender understands that the Person serving as Agent, acting in its individual capacity, and its Affiliates
(collectively, the Agents Group) are engaged in a wide range of financial services and businesses (including investment management, financing, 
  63 




 

securities trading, corporate and investment banking and research) (such services and businesses are collectively referred to in this Section 11.15 as Activities) and may
engage in the Activities with or on behalf of one or more of the Loan Parties or their respective Affiliates. Furthermore, the Agents Group may, in undertaking the Activities, engage in trading in financial products or undertake other
investment businesses for its own account or on behalf of others (including the Loan Parties and their Affiliates and including holding, for its own account or on behalf of others, equity, debt and similar positions in a Loan Party or its
Affiliates), including trading in or holding long, short or derivative positions in securities, loans or other financial products of one or more of the Loan Parties or their Affiliates. Each Lender understands and agrees that in engaging in the
Activities, the Agents Group may receive or otherwise obtain information concerning the Loan Parties or their Affiliates (including information concerning the ability of the Loan Parties to perform their respective obligations hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents) which information may not be available to any of the Lenders that are not members of the Agents Group. None of the Agent nor any member of the Agents Group shall have any duty to disclose to any Lender or
use on behalf of the Lenders, and shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, any information whatsoever about or derived from the Activities or otherwise (including any information concerning the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof) or to account for any revenue or profits obtained in connection with the Activities, except that the Agent shall deliver or otherwise make
available to each Lender such documents as are expressly required by any Loan Document to be transmitted by the Agent to the Lenders.   


(c)
Each Lender further understands that there may be situations where members of the Agents Group or their respective customers (including the Loan Parties and their Affiliates) either now have or may in the future
have interests or take actions that may conflict with the interests of any one or more of the Lenders (including the interests of the Lenders hereunder). Each Lender agrees that no member of the Agents Group is or shall be required to restrict
its activities as a result of the Person serving as Agent being a member of the Agents Group, and that each member of the Agents Group may undertake any Activities without further consultation with or notification to any Lender. None of
(i) this Agreement nor any other Loan Document, (ii) the receipt by the Agents Group of information (including Information) concerning the Loan Parties or their Affiliates (including information concerning the ability of the Loan
Parties to perform their respective obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents) nor (iii) any other matter shall give rise to any fiduciary, equitable or contractual duties (including without limitation any duty of trust or
confidence) owing by the Agent or any member of the Agents Group to any Lender including any such duty that would prevent or restrict the Agents Group from acting on behalf of customers (including the Loan Parties or their Affiliates) or
for its own account.  11.16 Successor Agent 
The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the
Majority Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is 
  64 



continuing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in
New York, New York. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (such
30-day period, the Lender Appointment Period), then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and with the consent of the Borrower so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. In addition and without any obligation on the part of the retiring Agent to appoint, on behalf of the Lenders, a
successor Agent, the retiring Agent may at any time upon or after the end of the Lender Appointment Period notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted appointment as successor Agent and the effective date of such
retiring Agents resignation. Upon the resignation effective date established in such notice and regardless of whether a successor Agent has been appointed and accepted such appointment, the retiring Agents resignation shall nonetheless
become effective and (i) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations as Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or
through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Majority Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Agent
hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties as Agent of the retiring (or retired) Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations as
Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise
agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After any retiring agents resignation hereunder as the Agent, the provisions of this Agreement shall continue in effect for its benefit and for the benefit of the Lenders in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by the retiring agent while it was acting as the Agent.  11.17 Indemnity 
Each Lender hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower), as to its Lenders Proportion from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating
to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under or in respect of the Loan Documents; provided that the Lenders shall not be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon
demand for its Lenders Proportion of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preservation of any rights of
the Agent or the Lenders under, or the enforcement of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, the Loan Documents, but only to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower. 
  65 


11.18 Delegation of Duties 
The Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any
one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent. The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through
their respective Related Parties. Each such sub-agent and the Related Parties of the Agent and each such sub-agent shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of
this Article 11 (as though such sub-agents were the Agent under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. 
11.19 No Other Duties, etc.  Anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Persons acting as Bookmanagers, Arrangers, documentation agents or syndication agents listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Agent or as a Lender hereunder.  11.20 Amendment to this Article 11 
Save and except for the provisions of Sections 11.5(a), 11.6, 11.8, 11.9(a), 11.10(b), 11.12, 11.14, 11.16 and this Section 11.20,
the provisions of this Article 11 may be amended or added to, from time to time, without the agreement of the Borrower provided such amendment or addition does not adversely affect the Borrower hereunder (including, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, increasing the liabilities or obligations of the Borrower hereunder). A copy of the instrument evidencing such amendment or addition shall be forwarded by the Agent to the Borrower as soon as practicable following the
execution thereof.  ARTICLE 12 
SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, 
JUDGMENT CURRENCY AND CONFIDENTIALITY 
12.1 Successors and Assigns  No Loan
Party may assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of all of the Lenders except as provided in Section 8.1(o). If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any Lender may, at the Borrowers cost and
expense, with the prior consent of the Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) and upon payment to the Agent of $3,500 assign in whole or in part its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents pursuant to a
Lender Transfer Agreement to any other Person where any such assignment is for the lesser of a minimum of $10,000,000 (and in multiples of $1,000,000 thereafter) and its Commitment; provided any increased cost to the Borrower as a result of such
assignment arising solely as a result of the residency of such Person will be a continuing obligation of such Lender. If no Event of Default has occurred, a Lender may, at its sole cost and expense, with the prior consent of the Agent and the
Borrower (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld) and upon payment to the Agent of $3,500 (except in the case of Section 3.11(b), Section 4.2(d) or an assignment by a Lender to an Affiliate), assign in whole or in part its rights
and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents pursuant to a Lender Transfer Agreement where any such assignment is for the lesser of a minimum of 
  66 



$10,000,000 (and in multiples of $1,000,000 thereafter) and its Commitment; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object
thereto by written notice to the Agent within ten Business Days after having received notice thereof. Upon any assignment by a Lender to an assignee permitted by this Section 12.1 (a Permitted Assignee) in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 12.1, such Lender shall cause such Permitted Assignee to be substituted for such Lender in respect of the whole or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents which are so assigned (other than in
respect of any rights under Section 6.3 or Article 10 to the extent any claim thereunder relates to an event arising prior to such assignment) and such Lender shall, as of the effective date thereof, be released from its obligations to the
Borrower hereunder arising subsequent to such date to the extent thereof. Any such assignment shall not increase, in aggregate, the cost or liabilities of the Borrower hereunder, other than the requirement to pay any costs and expenses associated
with an assignment by the Borrower. Nothing in this Section 12.1 shall restrict a Lender from the sale of a participation in all or any part of the Borrowings made or to be made by it; provided any increased cost as a result of any such
participation shall be for the sole account of such Lender and the Lender shall retain all voting rights hereunder. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a Security Interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including, without limitation, any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a Security Interest; provided that, no such pledge or assignment of a Security Interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender party hereto.  The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the
Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United States a copy of each Lender Transfer Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts
(and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the
Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this
purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participants
interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person except
to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in
the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any
notice to the contrary. 
  67 


12.2 Exchange and Confidentiality of Information 
Each of the Lenders and the Agent acknowledges the confidential nature of the financial, operational and other information, reports and data
provided and to be provided to them by the Loan Parties pursuant to this Agreement (the Information) and agrees to hold the Information in confidence and shall not discuss or disclose or allow access to, or transfer or transmit
the Information to any Person, provided however that:   


(a)
each of the Lenders and the Agent may disclose all or any part of the Information if such disclosure is required by any Applicable Law, or by applicable order, policy or directive having the force of law, to the extent
of such requirement, or is required in connection with any actual or threatened judicial, administrative or governmental proceeding, including, without limitation, proceedings initiated under or in respect of this Agreement; 
 


(b)
each of the Lenders and the Agent may disclose Information to each other and to any Permitted Assignees or participants and to their respective counsel, agents, employees and advisors; provided that in the case of a
participant, the participant has provided the Agent or the applicable Lender with the written agreement referred to in Section 12.2(c);   


(c)
each of the Lenders and the Agent may disclose and discuss the Information with credit officers of any potential Permitted Assignees for the purposes of assignment pursuant to Section 12.1 or any participant for
the purposes of a participation; provided that such potential Permitted Assignee or participant shall have, for the benefit of the Loan Parties, previously provided to the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, its written agreement to hold the
Information under the same obligations of confidentiality as set forth in this Section 12.2 at all times prior to and, if applicable, after becoming a Permitted Assignee or participant; 
 


(d)
each of the Lenders and the Agent may disclose all or any part of the Information so as to enable such Lender or the Agent to initiate any lawsuit against any Loan Party or to defend any lawsuit commenced by any Loan
Party, the issues of which are directly or indirectly related to the Information, but only to the extent such disclosure is necessary or desirable to the initiation or defense of such lawsuit; 
 


(e)
each of the Lenders and the Agent may disclose all or any part of the Information to the extent requested by any Governmental Authority having or claiming authority to regulate or oversee any aspect of such
Lenders or the Agents (as applicable) business or that of its Affiliates;   


(f)
subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, each of the Lenders may disclose all or any part of the Information to any actual or prospective party (or its managers,
administrators, trustees, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to any Loan Party and its obligations, this
Agreement or payments hereunder; and   


(g)
each of the Lenders and the Agent may disclose Information to any Person with the prior written consent of the Borrower. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Information shall not include any such information: 
  68

which is or becomes readily available to the public (other than by a breach hereof or by a breach of an obligation of confidentiality imposed on a Permitted Assignee or participant or other Person referred to in this
Section 12.2) or which has been made readily available to the public by a Loan Party;   


(i)
which the Agent or any Lender can show was, prior to receipt thereof from a Loan Party, lawfully in the Agents or such Lenders possession and not then subject to any obligation on its part to such Loan Party
to maintain confidentiality; or   


(j)
which the Agent or any Lender received from a third party, prior to receipt thereof from a Loan Party, which was not, to the knowledge of the Agent or such Lender, subject to a duty of confidentiality to such Loan Party
at the time the Information was so received.  12.3 Judgment Currency 
If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court in any jurisdiction with respect to this Agreement it becomes necessary to convert into
the currency of such jurisdiction (herein called the Judgment Currency) any amount due hereunder in any currency other than the Judgment Currency, then such conversion shall be made at the rate of exchange prevailing on the
Business Day before the day on which judgment is given. For such purpose rate of exchange means the spot rate at which the Agent, on the relevant date at or about 10:00 a.m., would be prepared to sell a similar amount of such
currency in New York, New York against the Judgment Currency. In the event that there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Business Day before the day on which the judgment is given and the date of payment of the amount due,
the applicable Loan Party shall, on the date of payment, pay such additional amounts (if any) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid on such date is the amount in the Judgment Currency which when converted at the rate of exchange
prevailing on the date of payment is the amount then due under this Agreement in such other currency. Any additional amount due from a Loan Party under this Section 12.3 shall be due as a separate debt and shall not be affected by judgment
being obtained for any other sums due under or in respect of this Agreement.  ARTICLE 13 
GUARANTY  13.1 Guaranty 
The Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at scheduled maturity or on
any date of a required prepayment or by acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under or in respect of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any extensions, modifications,
substitutions, amendments or renewals thereof), in each case, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, contract causes of action, costs, expenses or otherwise (such

  69 



without limitation, reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Agent or any Lender in enforcing any rights under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Guarantors liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by the Borrower to the Agent or any Lender under or in respect of this Agreement but for the fact that
they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving the Borrower.  13.2
Guaranty Absolute  The Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, regardless of any law, regulation, decree or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Agent or any Lender with respect thereto. The obligations of the Guarantor
under or in respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other obligations of the Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor
to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against the Borrower or whether the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions. The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and
unconditional irrespective of, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following: 
(a) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument relating thereto; 
(b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or
any other obligations of the Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from
the extension of additional credit to the Borrower or otherwise;  (c) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any other guaranty, for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations; 
(d) any manner of application of any collateral, or proceeds thereof, to all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any
manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other assets of the Borrower; 
(e) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of the Borrower; 
(f) any failure of the Agent or any Lender to disclose to the Guarantor any information relating to the business, condition
(financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of the Borrower now or hereafter known to the Agent or such Lender (the Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Agent and the Lenders to disclose such information);

  70 


(g) the failure of any other Person to execute or deliver any other guaranty or
agreement or the release or reduction of liability of the Guarantor or other guarantor or surety with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; or 
(h) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any
representation by the Agent or any Lender that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any other guarantor or surety. 
This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Agent or any Lender or any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. 
13.3 Waivers and Acknowledgments 
(a) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment,
demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Agent or any Lender protect, secure,
perfect or insure any lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Borrower or any other Person or any collateral. 
(b) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this
Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.  (c) The
Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the Agent or any Lender that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely
affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of the Guarantor or other rights of the Guarantor to proceed against the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other Person or any collateral and
(ii) any defense based on any right of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder. 
(d) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any duty on the part of the Agent or any Lender to disclose to
the Guarantor any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of the Borrower now or hereafter known by the Agent or such Lender. 
(e) The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements
contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set forth in Section 13.2 and this Section 13.3 are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. 
  71 


13.4 Subrogation 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against the
Borrower or any other insider guarantor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Guarantors obligations under or in respect of this Guaranty, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Agent or any Lender against the Borrower or any other insider guarantor or any collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or
right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Borrower or any other insider guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been
paid in full in cash (other than contingent indemnification or reimbursement obligations not then due and payable) and the Commitments shall have expired or been terminated. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the
immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the latest of (a) the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty (other than contingent indemnification or reimbursement
obligations not then due and payable) and (b) the Revolving Termination Date, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, shall be segregated from other property and funds of the Guarantor and
shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether
matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or to be held as collateral for any Guaranteed Obligations or other amounts payable under this Guaranty thereafter arising. If (i) the Guarantor shall make payment to the
Agent or any Lender of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash and (iii) the Revolving Termination Date
shall have occurred, the Agent and the Lenders will, at the Guarantors request and expense, execute and deliver to the Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer
by subrogation to the Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment made by the Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty. 
13.5 Subordination  The Guarantor
hereby subordinates any and all debts, liabilities and other obligations owed to the Guarantor by the Borrower (the Subordinated Obligations) to the Guaranteed Obligations to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in
this Section 13.5:  (a) Prohibited Payments, Etc. Except during the continuance of an Event of Default
(including the commencement and continuation of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to the Borrower), the Guarantor may receive payments from the Borrower on account of the Subordinated Obligations. After the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default (including the commencement and continuation of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to the Borrower), however, unless the Majority Lenders otherwise agree, the Guarantor not shall demand, accept or
take any action to collect any payment on account of the Subordinated Obligations. 
  72 


(b) Prior Payment of Guaranteed Obligations. In any proceeding under any
Bankruptcy Law relating to the Borrower, the Guarantor agrees that the Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations (including all interest and expenses accruing after the commencement of a
proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law, whether or not constituting an allowed claim in such proceeding (Post Petition Interest)) before the Guarantor receives payment of any Subordinated Obligations. 
(c) Turn-Over. After the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default (including the commencement and
continuation of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to the Borrower), the Guarantor shall, if the Agent so requests, collect, enforce and receive payments on account of the Subordinated Obligations as trustee for the Agent and the
Lenders and deliver such payments to the Agent on account of the Guaranteed Obligations (including all Post Petition Interest), together with any necessary endorsements or other instruments of transfer, but without reducing or affecting in any
manner the liability of the Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty.  (d) Agent Authorization. After
the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default (including the commencement and continuation of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to the Borrower), the Agent is authorized and empowered (but without any obligation to
so do), in its discretion, (i) in the name of the Guarantor, to collect and enforce, and to submit claims in respect of, Subordinated Obligations and to apply any amounts received thereon to the Guaranteed Obligations (including any and all
Post Petition Interest), and (ii) to require the Guarantor (A) to collect and enforce, and to submit claims in respect of, Subordinated Obligations and (B) to pay any amounts received on such obligations to the Agent for application
to the Guaranteed Obligations (including any and all Post Petition Interest).  13.6 Continuing Guaranty; Assignments 
This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the latest of (i) the payment in full in
cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty (other than contingent indemnification or reimbursement obligations not then due and payable) and (ii) the Revolving Termination Date, (b) be binding upon
the Guarantor, its successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Agent and the Lenders and their successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of clause (c) of the immediately
preceding sentence, the Agent or any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it) to
any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Agent or such Lender herein or otherwise, in each case as and to the extent provided in Section 12.1. The Guarantor
shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Agent and the Lenders.

 For purposes of the forgoing, at any time when the long term unsecured and unsubordinated debt of TCPL: 
 


 
(a)
is rated by each of S&P, Moodys and Fitch and is split rated, then the Applicable Margin shall be determined by the category that includes two such ratings, or if the ratings fall into three different
categories, the Applicable Margin will be determined based on the category that is the middle of such ratings;   


 
(b)
has only two ratings and is split rated, then

igher of such ratings;   


 
(c)
has only one rating (and such rating is by either S&P or Moodys), the Applicable Margin shall be the rate under the category so assigned; and 
 


 
(d)
has no rating by any of S&P, Moodys or Fitch, or is only rated by Fitch, the Applicable Margin shall be deemed to be the lowest rating category. 
Further, if the ratings established by Moodys, S&P and Fitch for the Index Debt shall be changed (other than as a result of a change
in the rating system of Moodys, S&P or Fitch), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating agency. Each change in the Applicable Margin shall apply during the period commencing on
the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding 



the effective date of the next such change. If the rating system of Moodys, S&P or Fitch shall change, or if any such rating agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate
debt obligations, the Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such
amendment, the Applicable Margin shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.
