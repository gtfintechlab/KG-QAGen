however, that if the Borrower wishes to request Term SOFR Loans having an Interest Period other than one (1), three (3) or six (6) months in duration as provided in the definition of Interest Period, the applicable
notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. five (5) Business Days prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall

  58 





give prompt notice to the Appropriate Lenders of such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is acceptable to all of them. Not later than 11:00 a.m., four
(4) Business Days before the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower (which notice may be by telephone) whether or not the requested Interest Period has been consented to
by all the Lenders. Each telephonic notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer
of the Borrower. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c), each Borrowing of or
conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (A) the Facility and whether the Borrower is requesting a
Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Loans, as the case may be, under such Facility, (B) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business
Day), (C) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (D) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Loans are to be converted, (E) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect
thereto, (F) the Borrowing Base applicable to the requested Borrowing, (G) whether the Lenders will be required to fund the requested Borrowing based on the respective Applicable Percentage, (H) each Lenders Applicable
Percentage of the requested Borrowing and (I) each Lenders Revolving Exposure after giving effect to the requested Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely
notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in
effect with respect to the applicable Term SOFR Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Term SOFR Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fail to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an
Interest Period of one (1) month.  (b) Advances. Following receipt of a Loan Notice for the Facility, the Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage under such Facility of the applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall
notify each Appropriate Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in Section 2.02(a). In the case of a Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative
Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agents Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02
(and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension to be made on the Closing Date, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent
either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of a bank acceptable to the Administrative Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to
(and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; provided, however, that if, on the date a Loan Notice with respect to a Revolving Borrowing is given by the Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then
the proceeds of such Revolving Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be made available to the Borrower as provided above. 
  59 




(c) Term SOFR Loans. Except as otherwise provided herein, a Term SOFR Loan may be
continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Term SOFR Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Term SOFR Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders, and
the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the outstanding Term SOFR Loans be converted immediately to Base Rate Loans.  (d)
Notice of Interest Rates. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Term SOFR Loans upon determination of such interest rate. At any time that Base
Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in the Prime Rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the announcement of such change. 
(e) Interest Periods. After giving effect to all Revolving Borrowings, all conversions of Revolving Loans from one Type to the other,
and all continuations of Revolving Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than eight (8) Interest Periods in effect in respect of the Facility. 
Section 2.03 Letters of Credit. 
(a) The Letter of Credit Commitment. 
(i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Lenders set
forth in this Section, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date, to issue Letters of Credit in Dollars for the account of the Borrower (or at the
request of the Borrower as specified in the applicable Letter of Credit Application, any other Loan Party), and to amend Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with Section 2.03(b), and (2) to honor drawings under the
Letters of Credit; and (B) the Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, as applicable, and any drawings thereunder in an amount up to their respective Applicable
Percentage of such Letter of Credit; provided that, after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, (x) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the lesser of the Facility and the Borrowing Base,
(y) the Revolving Exposure of any Lender shall not exceed such Lenders Commitment, and (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Each request by the Borrower for the issuance or
amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by the Borrower that the L/C Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Within the foregoing limits, and
subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that
have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. Each Existing Letter of Credit is deemed to be a Letter of Credit issued hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
(ii) The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit if: 
  60 




(A) the initial expiry date of the requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve
(12) months after the date of issuance, unless the Required Lenders have approved such expiry date; or  (B) the expiry date of the
requested Letter of Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date;  in each case, provided, however, that any Letter of
Credit may provide for renewal thereof for additional periods of up to twelve (12) months (which in no event shall extend beyond the date referred to in clause (B) above). 
(iii) Any issuance of a Letter of Credit is subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02, and the L/C Issuer shall
not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:  (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or
arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing the Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or the Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to the
Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which
was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;  (B) the issuance of the Letter of
Credit would violate one or more policies of the L/C Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally;  (C) except as otherwise agreed by
the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, the Letter of Credit is in an initial stated amount less than $100,000, in the case of a commercial Letter of Credit, or $100,000, in the case of a standby Letter of Credit; 
(D) the Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars; or 
(E) any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash
Collateral, satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with the Borrower or such Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuers actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.14(a)(iv)) with respect to the
Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to which the L/C Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole
discretion.  (iv) The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit if the L/C Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue the
Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof. 
  61 




(v) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if
(A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to the Letter of
Credit.  (vi) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents
associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters
of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term Administrative Agent as used in Article IX included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or
omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer.  (vii) In no event shall the Administrative Agent
be required to issue commercial or trade Letters of Credit.  (viii) Letters of Credit shall be used solely to support payment obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.  (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters
of Credit; Auto Extension Letters of Credit.  (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the
request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Notice may be
sent by fax transmission, by United States mail, by overnight courier, by electronic transmission using the system provided by the L/C Issuer, by personal delivery or by any other means acceptable to the L/C Issuer. Such Letter of Credit Notice must
be received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least three (3) Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their
sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit Application included in such Letter of Credit Notice shall
specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and
address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder;
(G) the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit; and (H) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit Application
included in such Letter of Credit Notice shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (3) the
nature of the proposed amendment; and (4) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require. Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent a Letter of Credit Notice and such other documents and
information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including 
  62 





any Issuer Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may require. Each Letter of Credit Notice shall specify (A) the Borrowing Base applicable to the requested Letter of
Credit, (B) each Lenders Revolving Exposure that will result after giving effect to the issuance of the requested Letter of Credit, (C) whether Lenders will be required to purchase their respective participation in the requested
Letter of Credit based on their respective Applicable Percentage, (D) the amount of the participation to be purchased by each Lender in the requested Letter of Credit and (E) each Lenders Applicable Percentage of the requested Letter
of Credit.  (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Notice, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by
telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Notice from the Borrower and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received
written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained
in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower (or at the request of the Borrower as specified
in the applicable Letter of Credit Application, any other Loan Party) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuers usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the
issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such
Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit.  (iii) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter
of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit
or amendment.  (iv) If the Borrower so requests in the Letter of Credit Application included in any applicable Letter of Credit Notice, the
L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a standby Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit); provided that, any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit
must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve (12) month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the
Non-Extension Notice Date) in each such twelve (12) month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower
shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the
extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined
that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of
Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven (7) Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date
(1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension. 
  63 




(v) Notwithstanding the terms of any Letter of Credit Application for a commercial Letter of
Credit, in no event may the Borrower extend the time for reimbursing any drawing under a commercial Letter of Credit by obtaining a bankers acceptance from the L/C Issuer. With respect to commercial Letters of Credit, the L/C Issuer may issue
sight and/or deferred payment Letters of Credit only.  (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations. 
(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall
notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an Honor Date), the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C
Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of
the unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed Amount), and the amount of such Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate
Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Loan Notice and the existence of a Borrowing Base Deficiency). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if
immediately confirmed in writing; provided that, the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
(ii) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash
Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agents Office in an amount equal to its Applicable Revolving Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day
specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The
Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer.  (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully
refinanced by a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Loan Notice and the existence of a Borrowing Base Deficiency) cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the
Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear
interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing
and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section. 
  64 




(iv) Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this
Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer. 
(v) Each Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of
Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have
against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default; or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;
provided, however, that each Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Loan Notice and
the existence of a Borrowing Base Deficiency). If, on any date of determination, a Letter of Credit has expired by its terms but any amount may still be drawn thereunder by reason of the operation of Rule 3.14 of the ISP, each Lender shall remain
obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any drawings made during the period after the expiry date of such Letter of Credit even if such Letter of Credit is extended beyond the Maturity Date of the Facility. No such making of an L/C Advance shall
relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
(vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such
Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender
(acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to
the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in
connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Revolving Loan included in the relevant Revolving Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the
relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

  65 




(d) Repayment of Participations. 
(i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lenders L/C
Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from
the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by
the Administrative Agent.  (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer, on demand of the Administrative Agent, such Lenders pro rata share thereof (determined based upon such Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage used to determine the applicable payment made by such
Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i)), plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of
the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.  (e)
Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability
of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document;  (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or
other right that the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any
other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement or by such Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated hereby or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
(iii) any draft, demand, endorsement, certificate or other document presented under or in connection with such Letter of Credit proving to be
forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such
Letter of Credit;  (iv) waiver by the L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for the L/C Issuers protection and not the protection
of the Borrower or any waiver by the L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice the Borrower;  (v) honor of a demand for
payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires that demand be in the form of a draft;  (vi) any payment made by
the L/C Issuer in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under such Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the
UCC, the ISP or the UCP, as applicable; 
  66 




(vii) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a
draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising
in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or  (viii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. 
The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any
claim of noncompliance with the Borrowers instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its
correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.  (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying
any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight or time draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as
to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant
or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or
omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Borrower hereby
assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower or any other
Loan Party from pursuing such rights and remedies as any of them may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any
correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Borrower or any other Loan Party as the applicable account party under a Letter of Credit may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower or such other Loan Party, to the extent, but only to the extent, of
any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower or such other Loan Party which the Borrower or such other Loan Party proves, as determined by a final nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction,
were caused by the L/C Issuers willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuers willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight or time draft and certificate(s)
strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer 
  67 





shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring, endorsing or assigning or purporting to transfer, endorse or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or
benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. The L/C Issuer may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) message or overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary. 
(g) Applicability of ISP and UCP; Limitation of Liability. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a
Letter of Credit is issued, (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the UCP shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the L/C Issuer shall not be
responsible to the Borrower for, and the L/C Issuers rights and remedies against the Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of the L/C Issuer required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or
permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where the L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as applicable, or in the decisions,
opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the International Chamber of Commerce Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and TradeInternational Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of
International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice.  (h) Letter of Credit
Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender, subject to Section 2.14, in proportion to its Applicable Revolving Percentage with respect to each Letter of Credit, a Letter of Credit fee (the
Letter of Credit Fee) for each Letter of Credit issued pursuant to this Section 2.03 equal to a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin times the aggregate face amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.
For purposes of computing the aggregate face amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. Letter of Credit Fees shall be due and payable
quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and
thereafter on demand.  (i) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall pay
directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee (i) with respect to each commercial Letter of Credit, at the rate equal to 0.25% per annum, computed on the amount of such Letter of Credit, and payable upon the issuance thereof,
(ii) with respect to any amendment of a commercial Letter of Credit increasing the amount of such Letter of Credit, at a rate separately agreed between the Borrower and the L/C Issuer, computed on the amount of such increase, and payable upon
the effectiveness of such amendment, and (iii) with respect to each standby Letter of Credit, at the rate equal to 0.25% per annum, computed on the aggregate face amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on a quarterly basis in
arrears. Such fronting fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit,
on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of 
  68 





such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance,
presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable. 
(j) Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the
terms hereof shall control.  (k) Additional L/C Issuers. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time with the consent of the
Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and such Lender, designate one or more additional Lenders to act as an L/C Issuer under the terms of this Agreement, subject to reporting requirements reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent with respect to issuances, amendments, extensions and terminations of Letters of Credit by such additional L/C Issuer. Any Lender designated as an L/C Issuer pursuant to this paragraph (k) shall be
deemed to be an L/C Issuer (in addition to being a Lender) in respect of Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Lender, and, with respect to such Letters of Credit, such term shall thereafter apply to the other L/C Issuer and
such Lender.  Section 2.04 Prepayments. 
(a) Optional.  (i) The
Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay any Revolving Borrowing in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that, (A) such notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (1) four (4) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Term SOFR Loans and (2) one (1) Business Day prior to any date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (B) any
prepayment of Term SOFR Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (C) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000
in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the Revolving Borrowing(s) being prepaid, the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid
and, if Term SOFR Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lenders ratable portion of such prepayment
(determined based on such Lenders Applicable Percentage in respect of each Revolving Borrowing (or portion thereof) being prepaid). If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount
specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of principal shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount of the Revolving Borrowing(s) being prepaid, together with any additional amounts
required pursuant to Section 3.05. Subject to Section 2.14, such prepayments shall be paid to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Loans being prepaid. 
  69 




(b) Mandatory. 
(i) Revolving Outstandings. If for any reason a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists in an amount in excess of twenty percent (20%) of
the Borrowing Base at any time of determination, the Borrower shall immediately on demand prepay Revolving Loans and/or L/C Borrowings (together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon) and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an
aggregate amount equal to such excess, and if a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists in an amount in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the Borrowing Base Collateral Agent shall have the right to have a field examination conducted on behalf of the
Collateral Agent in accordance with Section 6.10 with results reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. If for any reason a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists in an amount equal to or less than twenty percent (20%) of the Borrowing
Base at any time of determination, the Borrower shall, within forty-five (45) days of demand, prepay Revolving Loans and/or L/C Borrowings (together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon) and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in
an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided that, if such Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, at such time and at any time during which such Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, the Borrower does not have at least $100,000,000 in
unrestricted cash and deposit account balances with respect to which the Collateral Agent has obtained a perfected first priority Lien subject to no other Liens, the reference to forty-five (45) days in this sentence shall be deemed to
reference three (3) Business Days; and provided, further, that, at any time during which such Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent immediately in the event that the Borrower has less
than $100,000,000 in unrestricted cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any Borrowing Base Deficiency, the Borrower shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.04(b)(i) unless, after
the prepayment of the Revolving Loans, a Borrowing Base Deficiency continues to exist.  (ii) Certain Indebtedness. If the Borrower
is required to make a payment or contribution in connection with Indebtedness incurred pursuant to Section 7.02(i) and the conditions in clauses (x) and (y) of Section 7.02(i)(ii), after giving effect to such payment or contribution
on a Pro Forma Basis, are not satisfied, the Borrower shall immediately on demand prepay Revolving Loans and/or L/C Borrowings (together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon) and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate
amount sufficient to cause the Loan Parties to be in compliance with such conditions.  (iii) Application of Other Payments. Except
as otherwise provided in Section 2.14, prepayments of the Facility made pursuant to this Section 2.04(b), first, shall be applied ratably to the L/C Borrowings, second, shall be applied ratably to the outstanding Revolving
Borrowings, and, third, shall be used to Cash Collateralize the remaining L/C Obligations. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit that has been Cash Collateralized, the funds held as Cash Collateral shall be applied (without any further
action by or notice to or from the Borrower or any other Loan Party or any Defaulting Lender that has provided Cash Collateral) to reimburse the L/C Issuer or the Lenders, as applicable. 
Within the parameters of the applications set forth above, prepayments pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) shall be applied first to
Revolving Borrowings that consist of Base Rate Loans and then to Revolving Borrowings that consist of Term SOFR Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities. All prepayments under this Section 2.04(b) shall be subject to
Section 3.05, but otherwise without premium or penalty, and shall be accompanied by interest on the principal amount prepaid to the date of prepayment. Each Lenders pro rata share of a prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall equal such
Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage of such Revolving Borrowing. 
  70 




Section 2.05 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. 
(a) Optional. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Facility or the Letter of Credit Sublimit, or
from time to time permanently reduce the Facility or the Letter of Credit Sublimit; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. five (5) Business Days prior to the
date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce (A) the
Facility if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the Facility or the Revolving Exposure of any Lender would exceed such Lenders Commitment or (B) the Letter of
Credit Sublimit if, after giving effect thereto, the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations not fully Cash Collateralized hereunder would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. If after giving effect to any reduction or termination of Commitments
under this Section 2.05, the Letter of Credit Sublimit exceeds the Facility at such time, the Letter of Credit Sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. 
(b) Application of Commitment Reductions; Payment of Fees. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any termination
or reduction of the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Commitments under this Section 2.05. Upon any reduction of the Commitments, the Commitment of each Lender shall be reduced by such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such reduction
amount, the Facility shall be reduced as to such amount and any Commitment Fees accruing with respect thereto shall be calculated based on the reduced Facility. All fees in respect of the Facility accrued until the effective date of any termination
of the Facility shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.  Section 2.06 Repayment of Loans. 
The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date for the Facility the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans and all L/C
Borrowings outstanding on such date.  Section 2.07 Interest and Default Rate. 
(a) Interest. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.07(b), (i) each Term SOFR Loan under the Facility shall bear interest on
the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (or, following the Benchmark Transition Event, Benchmark) for such Interest Period plus the
Applicable Margin for such Facility; and (ii) each Base Rate Loan under the Facility shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
Applicable Margin for such Facility.  (b) Default Rate. 
(i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall
thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. 
  71 




(ii) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by the Borrower under any Loan
Document is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.  (iii) Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of
Default exists, outstanding Obligations (including Letter of Credit Fees) may accrue at a fluctuating rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. 
(iv) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. 
(c) Interest Payments. Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at
such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law. 
Section 2.08 Fees. 
In addition to certain fees described in Section 2.03: 
(a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee (the
Commitment Fee) equal to the Applicable Margin times the actual daily amount by which such Lenders Commitment exceeds the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of such Lenders Revolving Loans and (ii) the
Outstanding Amount of such Lenders L/C Obligations, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.14. The Commitment Fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the
conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last
day of the Availability Period for the Facility.  (b) Other Fees. 
(i) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter.
Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.  (ii) The Borrower shall pay to the
Lenders (x) an upfront fee equal to 1.00% of the Aggregate Commitments on the Closing Date and (y) such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned
when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 
  72 




Section 2.09 Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustments of
Applicable Margin. All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty-five
(365) or three hundred sixty-six (366) days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of
a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a three hundred sixty-five (365) day year). Interest shall
accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that, any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made
shall, subject to Section 2.11(a), bear interest for one (1) day. All computations of interest and fees in respect of the Facility shall be calculated on the basis of the full stated principal amount of the Facility. Each determination by
the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error 
Section 2.10 Evidence of Debt. 
(a) Maintenance of Accounts. The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained
by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made
by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to
the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall
control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Revolving Note, which shall evidence such
Lenders Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Revolving Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
(b) Maintenance of Records. In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.10(a), each Lender and the
Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records
maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
Section 2.11 Payments Generally; Administrative Agents Clawback. 
(a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any
counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at
the Administrative Agents Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later 
  73 





than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its ratable share of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to
such Lenders Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day (in the Administrative Agents sole discretion) and any applicable interest
or fee shall continue to accrue. Subject to Section 2.06 and as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the
next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.  (b) (i)
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate
Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share
available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower
severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry
rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest
rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest
paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower
shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
(ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has
made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Appropriate Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such
payment, then each of the Appropriate Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds
with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative
Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
  74 




A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any
amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions
Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the
Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received
from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.  (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to
make Revolving Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to Section 11.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment
under Section 11.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to
purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 11.04(c).  (e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed
to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
Section 2.12 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. 
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of (a) Obligations in
respect of any of the Facility due and payable to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such
Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of such Obligations due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facility due and payable
to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the Lenders at such time or (b) Obligations in respect of any of the Facility owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of such Obligations
owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facility owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of the Lenders at such time, then, in each case under clauses (a) and (b) above, the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (A) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact,
and (B) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared
by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of Obligations in respect of the Facility then due and payable to the Lenders or owing (but not due and payable) to the Lenders, as the case may be, provided that: 
  75 




(1) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of
the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
(2) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and
in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.13, or (z) any payment
obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof
(as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).  Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such
Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.  Section 2.13 Cash
Collateral.  (a) Certain Credit Support Events. If (i) the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request
under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, (ii) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, (iii) the Loan Parties shall be required to provide Cash
Collateral pursuant to Section 2.04 or 8.02(c), or (iv) there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, the Loan Parties shall immediately (in the case of clause (iii) above) or within one (1) Business Day (in all other cases)
following any request by the Collateral Agent or the L/C Issuer, provide Cash Collateral in an amount not less than the applicable Minimum Collateral Amount (determined in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to clause (iv) above,
after giving effect to Section 2.14(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).  (b) Grant of Security
Interest. The Loan Parties hereby grant to (and subjects to the control of) the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all
balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.13(c). If at any
time the Collateral Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Collateral Agent or the L/C Issuer as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum
Collateral Amount, the Loan Parties will, promptly upon demand by the Collateral Agent, pay or provide to 
  76 





the Collateral Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit)
shall be maintained in one or more Cash Collateral Accounts. The Loan Parties shall pay on demand therefor from time to time all customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in connection with the maintenance and
disbursement of Cash Collateral.  (c) Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash
Collateral provided under any of this Section 2.13 or Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.14 or 8.02 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, obligations to fund participations
therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Lender that is a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property
as may be provided for herein.  (d) Release. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting
Exposure or to secure other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the
applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 11.06(b)(vi))) or (ii) the determination by the Collateral Agent and the L/C Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided,
however, (A) any such release shall be without prejudice to, and any disbursement or other transfer of Cash Collateral shall be and remain subject to, any other Lien conferred under the Loan Documents and the other applicable provisions
of the Loan Documents, and (B) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations. 
Section 2.14 Defaulting Lenders. 
(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then,
until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:  (i) Waivers and
Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and Section 11.01.
 (ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.08 shall be applied at
such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a ratable basis of
any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.13; fourth, as the
Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which 
  77 





such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent
and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released as necessary in order to (A) satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (B) Cash Collateralize
the L/C Issuers future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.13; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to
the Lenders or the L/C Issuer as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or the L/C Issuer against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this
Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender
as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise as may be required under the Loan Documents in connection with any Lien conferred thereunder or
directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that, if (1) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share,
and (2) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed
to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded
participations in L/C Obligations are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages of such Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations without giving effect to Section 2.14(a)(v).
Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.14(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and
redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  (iii) Certain Fees. 
(A) Fees. No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under Section 2.08 for any period during which that
Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender). 
(B) Letter of Credit Fees. Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during which that
Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Revolving Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.13. 
(C) Defaulting Lender Fees. With respect to any Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to
clause (A) or (B) above, the Borrower shall (1) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting
Lenders participation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (2) pay to the L/C Issuer the amount of any such fee otherwise
payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (3) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. 
  78 




(iv) Reallocation of Applicable Revolving Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure.
All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders participation in L/C Obligations shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Revolving Percentages
(calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage) but only to the extent that (A) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower
shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (B) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate
Revolving Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of
any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased Revolving Exposure following such reallocation.  (v) Cash
Collateral. If the reallocation described in clause (a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Law, Cash Collateralize the
L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.13.  (b) Defaulting Lender Cure.
If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and
subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other
actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentage of each
such Loan and each such funded and unfunded participation in a Letter of Credit (without giving effect to Section 2.14(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that, no adjustments will be made
retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties,
no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. 
Section 2.15 Increase in Facility. 
(a) Request for Increase. Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the
Lenders), the Borrower may from time to time, request an increase in the Facility (Incremental Facility) so long as the Facility, after taking into account all such requests, does not exceed an aggregate principal amount of
$600,000,000; provided that (i) any such request for an Incremental Facility shall be in a minimum aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 and in increments of $5,000,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) the Borrower may make a maximum
of two (2) such requests; provided, however, that any such request that occurs within ninety (90) days after the most recent request shall not be deemed an additional request. At the time of sending such notice, the Borrower
(in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond. 
  79 




(b) Lender Elections to Increase. Each Lender shall elect to participate in the
Incremental Facility in its sole discretion and shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Applicable
Revolving Percentage of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment. 
(c) Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender of the
Lenders responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase, and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Borrower
may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement (New Lenders) in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel. 
(d) Effective Date and Allocations. If the Facility is increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower shall determine the effective date (the Revolving Increase Effective Date) and the final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower, the Lenders and the New Lenders of the
final allocation of such increase and the Revolving Increase Effective Date. The Applicable Percentages shall be recalculated in accordance with the final allocation of such increase to the extent that the final allocation of such increase is
nonratable among the Lenders.  (e) Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase. As a condition precedent to such increase, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Revolving Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching
the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the case of the Borrower, certifying that, immediately before and after giving effect to the Incremental Facility, (A) the representations and
warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are, (x) with respect to representations and warranties that contain a materiality qualification, true and correct in all respects, and (y) with respect to representations
and warranties that do not contain a materiality qualification, true and correct in all material respects, in each case, on and as of the Revolving Increase Effective Date (or if such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier
date, as of such earlier date), and except that, for purposes of this Section 2.15, the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements
furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 6.01, (B) no Default exists, (C) all financial covenants in Section 7.11 would be satisfied on a Pro Forma Basis on the Revolving Increase Effective Date
and for the most recent determination period, after giving effect to any such Incremental Facility (and assuming such Incremental Facility were fully drawn), (D) the maturity date of the Loans in respect of any portion of such Incremental Facility
shall be no earlier than the Maturity Date of the Facility, (E) the average life to maturity of the 
  80 





Loans in respect of such Incremental Facility shall be no shorter than the remaining average life to maturity of the Facility, and (F) all fees and expenses owing in respect of such increase
to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have been paid. The Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered any other customary documents (including, without limitation, legal opinions) as reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent
in connection with any Incremental Facility. The Borrower shall borrow from each New Lender and from each Lender increasing its Commitment on the Revolving Increase Effective Date, and such Lenders shall make, Revolving Loans to the Borrower (in the
case of Term SOFR Loans, with Adjusted Term SOFR Rate(s) applying to the Interest Period(s) ending on the date(s) of any then outstanding Interest Period(s)), and the Borrower shall prepay any Revolving Loans outstanding on the Revolving Increase
Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Revolving Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Revolving Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in
the Commitments under this Section. Each Lenders Applicable Percentage with respect to a Letter of Credit outstanding on the Revolving Increase Effective Date shall be recalculated in accordance with any revised Applicable Revolving
Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments under this Section.  (f) Conflicting Provisions. This Section
shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.12 or 11.01 to the contrary.  (g) Incremental Facility. Except as otherwise
specifically set forth herein, all of the other terms and conditions applicable to such Incremental Facility shall be identical to the terms and conditions applicable to the Facility, including, without limitation, having the same Guarantees as the
Facility and being secured on a pari passu basis by the same Collateral securing the Facility.  ARTICLE III 
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 
Section 3.01 Taxes. 
(a) Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes. 
(i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or
withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Administrative Agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the
Administrative Agent or a Loan Party, then the Administrative Agent or such Loan Party shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e)
below.  (ii) If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both
United States federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information
and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant 
  81 





Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan
Party shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.  (iii) If any Loan Party or the
Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) such Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such
deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) such Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall
timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the
applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.  (b) Payment of Other Taxes
by the Loan Parties. Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely
reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.  (c) Tax Indemnifications. 
(i) Each of the Loan Parties shall, and does hereby, jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof
within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01) payable or paid by such Recipient or
required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted
by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf
or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each of the Loan Parties shall also, and does hereby, jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within
ten (10) days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender or the L/C Issuer for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(ii) below. 
  82 




(ii) Each Lender and the L/C Issuer shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify and shall
make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, (A) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender or the L/C Issuer (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not
already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (B) the Administrative Agent and the Loan Parties, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such
Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (C) the Administrative Agent and the Loan Parties, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to
such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or a Loan Party in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each
Lender and the L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount
due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii).  (d) Evidence of Payments. Upon request by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the
Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or
other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be.  (e) Status of
Lenders; Tax Documentation.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to
payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent,
shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to
backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or
would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the
event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person,  (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), properly completed and executed
originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 
  83 




(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable
request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:  (1) in the case of a Foreign Lender
claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, properly completed and executed originals of IRS
Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other
applicable payments under any Loan Document, properly completed and executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the
business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;  (2) properly completed and executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;  (3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for
portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit K-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a
bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation
described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) properly completed and executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or
 (4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS
Form W-8IMY from the Foreign Lender, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance
Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit K-2 or Exhibit K-3, properly completed and executed originals of IRS
Form W-9 and/or IRS Form W 8IMY, and/or other required documents from each intermediary and direct or indirect beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that, if the Foreign Lender is a
partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit K-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;  (C) any
Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes
a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a
reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to
be made; and 
  84 




(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to
U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender
shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including
as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their
obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D),
FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  (iii) The Administrative Agent and each
Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall provide a new form or certification on or before the next Interest Payment
Date or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in writing of its legal inability to do so.  (f)
Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any
Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has
received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such
refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided that, each Loan Party, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the
event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to such Loan Party pursuant to
this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such
refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Recipient to make available its
tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.  (g)
Survival. Each partys obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the L/C
Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 
  85 




Section 3.02 Illegality. 
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender
or its Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate then, on notice thereof by such Lender to
the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such
Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such
illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise
to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term SOFR Loans of such Lender to Base
Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the
last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans and (ii) if such notice
asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without
reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate.
Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 
Section 3.03 Inability to Determine Rates; Benchmark Replacement. 
(a) Inability to Determine Rates. 
(i) Temporary. Subject to Section 3.03(b), if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall
be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Adjusted Term SOFR rate cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the
Borrower and each Lender. Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower and the Lenders, (A) any obligation of the Lenders to make or continue Term SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans shall be suspended
(to the extent of the affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice and (B) if such determination affects the calculation of the Base Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, during the period of such suspension,
compute the Base Rate without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate 
  86 





until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, or conversion or continuation of, Term SOFR Loans
(to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified
therein.  (b) Effect of Benchmark Transition Event. 
(i) Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a
Benchmark Transition Event, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the then-current Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective
at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all affected Lenders and the Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written
notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 3.03(b)(i) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark
Transition Start Date.  (ii) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the use, administration, adoption or
implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any
amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
(iii) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of
(i) implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (ii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes in connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement. The
Administrative Agent will notify the Borrower of (x) removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 3.03(b)(iv) and (y) the commencement of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any
determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 3.03(b), including any determination with respect to a tenor,
rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent
manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this
Section 3.03(b).  (iv) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark
is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the 
  87 





Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information
announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Borrower, may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition)
for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is
subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a
Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Borrower, may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate
such previously removed tenor.  (v) Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Borrowers receipt of notice of the commencement
of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Term SOFR Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and,

deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender; 
(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through
(d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
 (iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Term SOFR
Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or
the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any 
  88 





Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer or Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then,

the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the L/C
Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or the L/C Issuers capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of
such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lenders or the L/C
Issuers holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or the L/C Issuers policies and the policies of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company with respect
to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lenders or the L/C
Issuers holding company for any such reduction suffered.  (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or the
L/C Issuer or Recipient setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or Recipient or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered
to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer or Recipient, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 
(d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer or Recipient to demand compensation pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers or Recipients right to demand such compensation; provided that, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate
a Lender or the L/C Issuer or Recipient pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer or Recipient, as
the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers or Recipients intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine (9) month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
Section 3.05 Compensation for Losses. 
Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for
and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 
  89 




(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate
Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); 
(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any
Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or  (c) any assignment of a Term SOFR Loan on a day
other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 11.13;  including any loss of
anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay
any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.  Section 3.06 Mitigation
Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation
under Section 3.04, or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender, the L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.01, or if
any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then at the request of the Borrower, such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans
hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable
pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the
case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the L/C
Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment.  (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in each case, such Lender has declined
or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 3.06(a), the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 11.13. 
Section 3.07 Survival. 
All of the Borrowers obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all

Appropriate Lenders (in their sole discretion) as determined in accordance with Section 11.01; and once an Event of Default occurs under the Loan Documents, then such Event of Default will continue to exist until it is expressly waived by the
requisite Appropriate Lenders or by the Administrative Agent with the approval of the requisite Appropriate Lenders, as required hereunder in Section 11.01. 
Section 8.02 Remedies upon Event of Default. 
If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of, or may, with the consent of, the Required
Lenders, take any or all of the following actions: 
  134 




(a) declare the Commitment of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation of the L/C Issuer
to make L/C Credit Extensions to be terminated, whereupon such commitments and obligation shall be terminated;  (b) declare the unpaid
principal amount of all outstanding Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Loan Parties;  (c) require that the Loan Parties Cash Collateralize
the L/C Obligations (in an amount equal to the Minimum Collateral Amount with respect thereto); and  (d) exercise on behalf of itself, the
Lenders and the L/C Issuer all rights and remedies available to it, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under the Loan Documents or applicable Law or equity; 
provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Loan Parties under the
Bankruptcy Code of the United States, the obligation of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions shall automatically terminate, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans and all interest
and other amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable, and the obligation of the Loan Parties to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations as aforesaid shall automatically become effective, in each case without further act of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender.  For the avoidance of doubt, if any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Collateral Agent
may take any or all of the remedial actions described in the Collateral Documents.  Section 8.03 Application of
Funds.  After the exercise of remedies provided for in Section 8.02 (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately
due and payable and the L/C Obligations have automatically been required to be Cash Collateralized as set forth in the proviso to Section 8.02) or if at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to
pay fully all Secured Obligations then due hereunder, any amounts received on account of the Secured Obligations shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 2.13 and 2.14, be applied by the Administrative Agent in the following order:
 First, to payment of that portion of the Secured Obligations constituting fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including
fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent and amounts payable under Article III) payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such; 
Second, to payment of that portion of the Secured Obligations constituting fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal,
interest and Letter of Credit Fees) payable to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer (including fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the respective Lenders and the L/C Issuer arising under the Loan Documents and amounts payable under
Article III, ratably among them in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Second payable to them; 
  135 




Third, to payment of that portion of the Secured Obligations constituting accrued and
unpaid Letter of Credit Fees and interest on the Loans, L/C Borrowings and other Secured Obligations arising under the Loan Documents, ratably among the Lenders and the L/C Issuer in proportion to the respective amounts described in this
clause Third payable to them;  Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Secured Obligations constituting unpaid principal of
the Loans, L/C Borrowings and Secured Obligations then owing under Secured Hedge Agreements and Secured Cash Management Agreements, ratably among the Lenders, the L/C Issuer, the Hedge Banks and the Cash Management Banks in proportion to the
respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held by them;  Fifth, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
L/C Issuer, to Cash Collateralize that portion of L/C Obligations comprised of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit to the extent not otherwise Cash Collateralized by the Loan Parties pursuant to Sections 2.03 and 2.13; and
 Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Secured Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, to the Loan Parties or as
otherwise required by Law.  Subject to Sections 2.03(c) and 2.13, amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate undrawn
amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause Fifth above shall be applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur. If any amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have either been
fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to the other Secured Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above. Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to any Guarantor shall not be paid with amounts received from such
Guarantor or its assets, but appropriate adjustments shall be made with respect to payments from other Loan Parties to preserve the allocation to Secured Obligations otherwise set forth above in this Section. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Secured Obligations arising under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements shall be
excluded from the application described above if the Administrative Agent has not received a Secured Party Designation Notice, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management
Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be. Each Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank not a party to this Agreement that has given the notice contemplated by the preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the
appointment of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of Article IX for itself and its Affiliates as if a Lender party hereto.

foregoing, each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent is hereby expressly authorized to (i) execute any and all documents (including releases) with respect to the Collateral and the rights of the Secured Parties with respect

Issuer, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any
other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used
as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
Section 9.02 Rights as a Lender. 
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a
Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context

the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and their respective Related Parties: 
(a) shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; 
  137 




(b) shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other
number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion
or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the
automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; 
(c) shall, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty or responsibility to disclose, and shall be
liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent or any of its
Affiliates in any capacity; and  (d) shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided herein or in the other Loan Documents) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
None of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any of their respective Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not

and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. Any such action taken or failure to act pursuant to the foregoing
shall be binding on all Lenders. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or the L/C Issuer.  None of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any of their
respective Related Parties shall be responsible for, or have any duty or obligation to any Lender or any other Person to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other
terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the
creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the Collateral Documents, (v) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral, or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere

Section 9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent.
 Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying and
shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, communication, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution)
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by
it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension,
renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may consult with
legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Loan Parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or
experts. For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 4.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other
matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying
its objections.  Section 9.05 Delegation of Duties. 
Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder
or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent
may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the
Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Facility as well as
activities as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent
that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection
of such sub-agents. 
  139 




Section 9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent.  (a) Notice. Each of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation
to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United
States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier days as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed,
such resignation shall become effective in accordance with the notice on the Resignation Effective Date. If no successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent has been appointed by the Resignation Effective Date, the Required Lenders shall
thereafter perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder and/or under any other Loan Document until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as
the case may be.  (b) Defaulting Lender. If the Person serving as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent is a Defaulting Lender
pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent and, in
consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the
Required Lenders) (the Removal Effective Date), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. 
(c) Effect of Resignation or Removal. Any such resignation by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent hereunder shall also
constitute, to the extent applicable, its resignation as an L/C Issuer, in which case such resigning Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (x) shall not be required to issue any further Letters of Credit hereunder and (y) shall maintain
all of its rights as L/C Issuer with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it prior to the Resignation Effective Date. With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (i) the retiring or
removed Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Collateral Agent on behalf of the
Lenders or the L/C Issuer under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Collateral Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Collateral Agent is appointed and shall continue to receive its
current level of remuneration for such continuation of service) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, all payments, communications and
determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the L/C Issuer directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the

  140 





rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or removed) Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (other than as provided in Section 3.01(g) and other than any rights to indemnity
payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative
Agent or Collateral Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring or removed Administrative Agents or Collateral Agents resignation or
removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, its sub agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent was acting as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent. 
(d) L/C Issuer. Any resignation by Silicon Valley Bank as Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its
resignation as L/C Issuer. If Silicon Valley Bank or KeyBank National Association resigns as an L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit issued by it
outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to
Section 2.03(c). Upon the appointment by the Borrower of a successor L/C Issuer hereunder (which successor shall in all cases be a Lender other than a Defaulting Lender and shall be subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and such Lender), (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer, (ii) the retiring L/C Issuer
shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (iii) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit issued by the retiring L/C
Issuer, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
Section 9.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. 
Each Lender and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, any Arranger, any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer
also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Arranger, any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time
to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Each Lender and each
L/C Issuer represents and warrants that (i) the Loan Documents set forth the terms of a commercial lending facility and (ii) it is engaged in 
  141 





making, acquiring or holding commercial loans, issuing or participating in letters of credit or providing other similar facilities in the ordinary course and is entering into this Agreement as a
Lender or L/C Issuer for the purpose of making, acquiring or holding commercial loans, issuing or participating in letters of credit and providing other facilities set forth herein as may be applicable to such Lender or L/C Issuer, and not for the
purpose of purchasing, acquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument, and each Lender and each L/C Issuer agrees not to assert a claim in contravention of the foregoing. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer represents and warrants that it
is sophisticated with respect to decisions to make, acquire or hold commercial loans, issue or participate in letters of credit and to provide other facilities set forth herein, as may be applicable to such Lender or L/C Issuer, and either it, or
the Person exercising discretion in making its decision to make, acquire or hold such commercial loans, issue or participate in letters of credit or to provide such other facilities, is experienced in making, acquiring or holding such commercial
loans, issuing or participating in letters of credit or providing such other facilities.  Section 9.08 No Other Duties,
Etc.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the titles listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers,
duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, a Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement or any provision of any other Loan Document, each Arranger is named as such for recognition purposes only, and in its capacity as such shall have no duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document; it being understood and agreed that each Arranger shall be entitled to all indemnification and reimbursement rights in favor of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent provided herein and in the other Loan Documents.
Without limitation of the foregoing, each Arranger in its capacity as such shall not, by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, have any fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender, Loan Party or any other Person. 
Section 9.09 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim; Credit Bidding. 
(a) In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the
Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any
demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:  (i) to file and prove a claim
for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Secured Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to
have the claims of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent and their respective
agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(h) and (i), 2.08, and 11.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 
 
  142 




(ii) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such
claims and to distribute the same;  and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such
judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and the L/C Issuer to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the
L/C Issuer, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under
Sections 2.08 and 11.04.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent
to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or the L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Secured Obligations or the rights of any Lender or the L/C Issuer or to
authorize the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or the L/C Issuer or in any such proceeding. 
(b) The Loan Parties and the Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent, based upon the instruction of the Required
Lenders, to (a) credit bid and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code of the United
States, including under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States or any similar Laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is subject, or (b) credit bid and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one
or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral at any other sale or foreclosure conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Collateral Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with
applicable Law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Secured Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid on a ratable basis (with Secured Obligations with respect to contingent or
unliquidated claims being estimated for such purpose if the fixing or liquidation thereof would not unduly delay the ability of the Collateral Agent to credit bid and purchase at such sale or other disposition of the Collateral and, if such claims
cannot be estimated without unduly delaying the ability of the Collateral Agent to credit bid, then such claims shall be disregarded, not credit bid, and not entitled to any interest in the asset or assets purchased by means of such credit bid) and
the Secured Parties whose Secured Obligations are credit bid shall be entitled to receive interests (ratably based upon the proportion of their Secured Obligations credit bid in relation to the aggregate amount of Secured Obligations so credit bid)
in the asset or assets so purchased (or in the Equity Interests of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such purchase). Except as provided above and otherwise expressly provided for herein or in the other Collateral
Documents, the Collateral Agent will not execute and deliver a release of any Lien on any Collateral. Upon request by the Collateral Agent or the Borrower at any time, the Secured Parties will confirm in writing the Collateral Agents authority
to release any such Liens on particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 9.09. 
  143 




Section 9.10 Collateral and Loan Party Guarantee Matters. 
Each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential Cash Management Bank and a potential Hedge Bank) and the L/C Issuer
irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent, at its option and in its discretion,  (a) to release any Lien on any property granted to or
held by the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon the Facility Termination Date, (ii) that is sold or otherwise disposed of or to be sold or otherwise disposed of as part of or in connection with any sale or other disposition
permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or (iii) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders in accordance with Section 11.01; 
(b) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on
such property that is permitted by Section 7.01(i);  (c) to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Loan Party Guarantee
if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents or if such person becomes an Excluded Subsidiary; 
(d) to release any Lien on the assets or Equity Interests of a Subsidiary that becomes an Excluded Subsidiary. 
Upon request by the Collateral Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Collateral Agents authority to
release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Loan Party Guarantee pursuant to this Section 9.10. In each case as specified in this Section 9.10,
the Collateral Agent will, at the Borrowers expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security
interest granted under the Collateral Documents or to subordinate its interest in such item, or to release such Guarantor from its obligations under the Loan Party Guarantee, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this
Section 9.10.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or
inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Collateral Agents Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in
connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral. 
Section 9.11 Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements. 
Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, no Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank that obtains the benefit of the provisions of
Section 8.03, the Loan Party Guarantee or any Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or any Collateral Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other
Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) (or to notice of or to consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of the 
  144 





provisions hereof or of the Loan Party Guarantee or any Collateral Document) other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IX to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Secured Obligations arising
under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements except to the extent expressly provided herein and unless the Administrative Agent has received a Secured Party Designation Notice of such Secured Obligations, together with such
supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory
arrangements have been made with respect to, Secured Obligations arising under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements in the case of the Facility Termination Date. 
Section 9.12 Field Examinations. 
The Collateral Agent shall conduct a field examination pursuant to Section 6.10 at least one time during each calendar year, and not more
than 15 months from the prior field examination). Promptly following any field examination that is conducted by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent, and not later than ten (10) days after sign-off from

Section 9.13 Erroneous Payments. If the Administrative Agent (x) notifies a Lender, L/C Issuer or Secured
Party, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, L/C Issuer Bank or Secured Party (any such Lender, L/C Issuer, Secured Party or other recipient (and each of their respective successors and assigns), a Payment
Recipient) that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole discretion (whether or not after receipt of any notice under immediately succeeding clause (b)) that any funds (as set forth in such notice from the
Administrative Agent) received by such Payment Recipient from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates were erroneously or mistakenly transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not
known to such Lender, L/C Issuer, Secured Party or other Payment Recipient on its behalf) (any such funds, whether transmitted or received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise, individually
and collectively, an Erroneous Payment) and (y) demands in writing the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of the Administrative Agent pending
its return or repayment as contemplated below in this Section 9.13 and held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, and such Lender, L/C Issuer or Secured Party shall (or, with respect to any Payment Recipient
who received such funds on its behalf, shall cause such Payment Recipient to) promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter (or such later date as the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, specify in writing), return
to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made, in same day funds (in the currency so received), together with interest thereon (except to the extent waived in writing by
the Administrative Agent) in respect of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in same day funds at the
greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Payment Recipient under
this clause (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
  145 




(b) Without limiting immediately preceding clause (a), each Lender, L/C Issuer,
Secured Party or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, L/C Issuer or Secured Party (and each of their respective successors and assigns), agrees that if it receives a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received as a
payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise) from the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in this
Agreement or in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment,
prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates), or (z) that such Lender, L/C Issuer or Secured Party, or other such recipient, otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in
whole or in part), then in each such case:  (i) it acknowledges and agrees that (A) in the case of immediately preceding clauses
(x) or (y), an error and mistake shall be presumed to have been made (absent written confirmation from the Administrative Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error and mistake has been made (in the case of immediately preceding
clause (z)), in each case, with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment; and  (ii) such Lender, L/C Issuer or Secured
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of
the occurrence of any of the circumstances described in immediately preceding clauses (x), (y) and (z)) notify the Administrative Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the details thereof (in reasonable
detail) and that it is so notifying the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 9.13(b).  For the
avoidance of doubt, the failure to deliver a notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 9.13(b) shall not have any effect on a Payment Recipients obligations pursuant to
Section 9.13(a) or on whether or not an Erroneous Payment has been made.  (c) Each Lender, L/C Issuer or Secured
Party hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender, L/C Issuer or Secured Party under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent
to such Lender, L/C Issuer or Secured Party under any Loan Document with respect to any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts, against any amount that the Administrative Agent has demanded to be returned under immediately preceding
clause (a).  (d) (i) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Administrative Agent for
any reason, after demand therefor in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and/or from any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or
portion thereof) on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an Erroneous Payment Return 
  146 





Deficiency), upon the Administrative Agents notice to such Lender at any time, then effective immediately (with the consideration therefor being acknowledged by the parties
hereto), (A) such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Loans (but not its Commitments) with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the Erroneous Payment Impacted Class) in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment
Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Loans (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Class, the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment) (on a
cashless basis and such amount calculated at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by the Administrative Agent in such instance)), and is hereby (together with the Borrower) deemed to execute and deliver an
Assignment and Assumption (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to a Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants) with respect to such
Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and such Lender shall deliver any Revolving Notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (but the failure of such Person to deliver any such Revolving Notes shall not affect the
effectiveness of the foregoing assignment), (B) the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to have acquired the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (C) upon such deemed acquisition, the Administrative Agent as the
assignee Lender shall become a Lender, as applicable, hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender shall cease to be a Lender, as applicable, hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment
Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender, (D) the Administrative Agent
and the Borrower shall each be deemed to have waived any consents required under this Agreement to any such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and (E) the Administrative Agent will reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the
Loans subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender and such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.  (ii) Subject to Section 11.06 (but excluding, in all events, any assignment consent or
approval requirements (whether from the Borrower or otherwise)), the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Loans acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the
Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Loan (or portion thereof), and the Administrative Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such
Lender (and/or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf). In addition, an Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender (x) shall be reduced by the proceeds of prepayments or repayments of
principal and interest, or other distribution in respect of principal and interest, received by the Administrative Agent on or with respect to any such Loans acquired from such Lender pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment (to the
extent that any such Loans are then owned by the Administrative Agent) and (y) may, in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent, be reduced by any amount specified by the Administrative Agent in writing to the applicable Lender from time
to time. 
  147 




(e) The parties hereto agree that (x) irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent
may be equitably subrogated, in the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered from any Payment Recipient that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be
subrogated to all the rights and interests of such Payment Recipient (and, in the case of any Payment Recipient who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, L/C Issuer or Secured Party, to the rights and interests of such Lender, L/C Issuer or
Secured Party, as the case may be) under the Loan Documents with respect to such amount (the Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights) (provided that the Loan Parties Obligations under the Loan Documents in respect of the
Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights shall not be duplicative of such Obligations in respect of Loans that have been assigned to the Administrative Agent under an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment) and (y) an Erroneous Payment shall not
pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party; provided that this Section 9.13 shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for),
or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the Obligations of the Borrower relative to the amount (and/or timing for payment) of the Obligations that would have been payable had such Erroneous Payment not been made by the
Administrative Agent; provided, further, that for the avoidance of doubt, immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y) shall not apply to the extent any such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount
of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment. 
(f) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby
waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous
Payment received, including, without limitation, any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine.  (g) Each
partys obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 9.13 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender or
L/C Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document. 
Section 9.14 Flood Law Compliance Policies . 
(a) The Collateral Agent maintains internal policies and procedures, standards and/or other documentation that address requirements placed on
federally-regulated lenders under the federal laws and regulations regarding flood insurance, including the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended (the Flood Laws). The
Collateral Agent will deliver to the Administrative Agent to post on the Platform (or otherwise distribute to each Lender) documents that the Collateral Agent receives or notices that it gives in connection with the Flood Laws. However, the
Collateral Agent reminds each Lender that, pursuant to the Flood Laws, each federally regulated lender is responsible for assuring its own compliance with the flood insurance requirements. 
(b) The Collateral Agent shall use reasonable efforts to deliver to the Administrative Agent the documents and notices described in
Section 9.14(a) in a manner that will permit the Administrative Agent to make such posting or distribution not less than three (3) Business Days prior to execution of any Mortgage covering any improved real property that is taken as
Collateral after the Closing Date. 
  148 




(c) The Collateral Agent shall use reasonable efforts to maintain a customary life of loan
monitoring agreement to determine the status of each Mortgaged Property as a Flood Hazard Property.  ARTICLE X 
CONTINUING GUARANTY

Each Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally, jointly and severally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not
merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all Obligations and Additional Secured Obligations (for
each Guarantor, subject to the proviso in this sentence, its Guaranteed Obligations); provided that liability of each Guarantor individually with respect to this Loan Party Guarantee shall be limited to an aggregate amount
equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law. The Administrative
Agents books and records showing the amount of the Secured Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon each Guarantor, and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the
Secured Obligations. This Loan Party Guarantee shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Secured Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Secured Obligations, or by the existence,
validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Secured Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the
obligations of the Guarantors, or any of them, under this Loan Party Guarantee, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing. 
Section 10.02 Rights of Lenders. 
Each Guarantor consents and agrees that the Secured Parties may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without
affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Secured Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take,
hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Loan Party Guarantee or any Secured Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof
as the Collateral Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders in their sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Secured Obligations. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Guarantor under this Loan Party Guarantee or which, but for this provision, might operate as a
discharge of such Guarantor. 
  149 




Section 10.03 Certain Waivers. 
Each Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Borrower or any other Guarantor, or the
cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Secured Party) of the liability of the Borrower or any other Loan Party; (b) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantors obligations exceed or are more
burdensome than those of the Borrower or any other Loan Party; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affec

ncial condition, business and operations of the Borrower and any such other Guarantor as such Guarantor requires, and that none of the Secured Parties has any duty, and such Guarantor is not
relying on the Secured Parties at any time, to disclose to it any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrower or any other Guarantor (each Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Secured Parties to
disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).  Section 10.09 Appointment of
Borrower.  Each of the Guarantors hereby appoints the Borrower to act as its agent for all purposes of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents and agrees that (a) the Borrower may execute such documents on behalf of such Guarantor as the Borrower deem appropriate in its sole discretion and each Guarantor shall be obligated by all of the terms of any such document
executed on its behalf, (b) any notice or communication delivered by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Lenders to the Borrower shall be deemed delivered to each Guarantor and (c) the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent or the Lenders may accept, and be permitted to rely on, any document, instrument or agreement executed by the Borrower on behalf of each Guarantor. 
Section 10.10 Right of Contribution. 
The Guarantors agree among themselves that, in connection with payments made hereunder, each Guarantor shall have contribution rights against
the other Guarantors as permitted under applicable Law.  Section 10.11 Keepwell. 
Each Loan Party that is a Qualified ECP Guarantor at the time the Loan Party Guarantee or the grant of a Lien under the Loan Documents, in
each case, by any Specified Loan Party becomes effective with respect to any Swap Obligation, hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support to each Specified Loan Party
with respect to such Swap Obligation as may be needed by such Specified Loan Party from time to time to honor all of its obligations under the Loan Documents in respect 
  151 





of such Swap Obligation (but, in e

 under this Article X voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall
remain in full force and effect until the Secured Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full. Each Loan Party intends this Section to constitute, and this Section shall be deemed to constitute, a guarantee of the obligations of,
and a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of, each Specified Loan Party for all purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.

exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan
Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan Document, are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in
any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such
enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 8.02 for the benefit of all the Lenders and the L/C Issuer; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
prohibit (a) the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (b) the L/C Issuer
from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as L/C Issuer) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (c) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 11.08 (subject
to the terms of Section 2.12), or (d) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Loan Party under any Debtor Relief Law; and
provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 2.12, any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders,
enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders.  Section 11.04 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage
Waiver.  (a) Costs and Expenses. The Loan Parties shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, each Arranger, the Collateral Agent and the L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of
counsel for such Persons), in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments,
modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated); (ii) all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the L/C Issuer in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment
thereunder; and (iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, each Arranger, the Collateral Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer and their
respective Affiliates 
  157 





(including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for such Persons) (x) in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights (A) in connection with this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or (B) in connection with Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit, and (y) in connection with any documentary taxes associated with the
Facility.  (b) Indemnification by the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Lender and the L/C Issuer, and each Related Party, successor and assign of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee)
against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel, which shall include the fees of one firm of counsel for all
Indemnitees, taken as a whole (and, if necessary, the fees of a single firm of local counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction for all Indemnitees, taken as a whole (and, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest, the fees of another
firm of counsel (and local counsel, if applicable) for such affected Indemnitee))), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any Person (including the Borrower or any other Loan Party) arising out of, in connection with, or
as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the administration of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including in respect of any matters addressed in Section 3.01), (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the L/C Issuer to
honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or Release of Hazardous
Materials on or from any property owned or operated by a Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or related to any of the Projects, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to a Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual
or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower or any other Loan Party or any of the
Borrowers or such Loan Partys Affiliates, directors, equity holders or creditors, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that, such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the
extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnitee. Without limiting the provisions of Section 3.01(c), this Section 11.04(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any
non-Tax claim.  (c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Loan Parties for any
reason fail to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the
L/C Issuer or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer or such Related Party,
as the case may be, such Lenders pro rata share (determined as of the time that the 
  158 





applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought based on each Lenders share of the Total Credit Exposure at such time) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid amount
in respect of a claim asserted by such Lender), provided, further that, the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (or any such sub-agent) or the L/C Issuer in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent (or any such sub-agent) or the L/C Issuer in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.11(d).
 (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, no Loan Party shall assert, and each
Loan Party hereby waives, and acknowledges that no other Person shall have, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.
No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through
telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten (10) Business Days after demand therefor.
 (f) Survival. The agreements in this Section and the indemnity provisions of Section 11.02(e) shall survive the resignation
of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the L/C Issuer, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations. 
Section 11.05 Payments Set Aside. 
To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Loan Parties is made to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the L/C Issuer
or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent
or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in
connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if
such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and the L/C Issuer severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any
amount so recovered from or repaid 
  159 





by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from
time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
Section 11.06 Successors and Assigns. 
(a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and thereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section,
(ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section (and
any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the L/C Issuer and
the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.  (b) Assignments by Lenders. Any
Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment(s) and the Loans (including for purposes of this
subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations) at the time owing to it); provided that (in each case with respect to the Facility), any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(i) Minimum Amounts. 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment under the Facility and/or the Loans
at the time owing to it (in each case with respect to the Facility) or contemporaneous assignments to related Approved Funds that equal at least the amount specified in paragraph (b)(i)(B) of this Section in the aggregate or in the case of an
assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and  (B) in any case not
described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans
of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment
and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 (and shall be in an amount of an integral multiple of $1,000,000), in the case of any assignment in respect of the Facility, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long
as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 
  160 




(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of
a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to the Loans and/or the Commitment assigned. 
(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of
this Section and, in addition:  (A) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be
required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that, (i) in no event shall any
such assignment be made to any Competitor of the Loan Parties and (ii) the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five
(5) Business Days after having received notice thereof;  (B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of any Commitment if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender with a Commitment in respect of the applicable Facility, an Affiliate of such Lender or an
Approved Fund with respect to such Lender; and  (C) the consent of the L/C Issuer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) shall be required for any assignment in respect of the Facility.  (iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole
discretion, elect to waive or reduce such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire and all applicable tax forms. 
(v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries, (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or (C) to a natural Person. 
(vi) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no
such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon
distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent,
the applicable pro rata 
  161 





share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (A) pay and satisfy in full
all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (B) acquire (and fund as appropriate) such Defaulting Lenders full pro rata
share of all Revolving Borrowings and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Applicable Percentage of each Revolving Borrowing and of each participation in a Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any
assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting
Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant
to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 and 11.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment); provided that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no
assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a
Revolving Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.  (c) Register. The
Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or
the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name
is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice. Upon its receipt of, and consent to, a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, an Administrative Questionnaire completed in respect of the assignee (unless the assignee shall
already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) above, if applicable, and the written consent of the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer and, if required, the Borrower, to such assignment and
any applicable tax forms, the Administrative Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment and Assumption and (ii) promptly record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective unless it has been recorded in
the Register as provided in this paragraph (c). 
  162 




(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to,
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all
or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lenders participations in L/C Obligations) owing to it); provided that,
(i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement; and provided, further, that in no event
shall any such participation be sold to any Competitor of the Loan Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 11.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participations. 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right
to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that, such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant,
agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in clauses (c), (d), (e), (i) and (j) of the first proviso to Section 11.01 that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05, subject to the requirements and limitations herein, including the requirements under Section 3.01(e) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be
delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that, such Participant (A) agrees to be
subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 11.13 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect
to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the
Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06
with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that, such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.12 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the
name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that,
no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or
its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the 
  163 





United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no
responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time, without consent of the
Loan Parties or the Administrative Agent, pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Revolving Note or Revolving Notes, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including
any pledge or assignment to secure obligations, to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.  (f) Resignation as L/C Issuer after Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
at any time a Lender assigns all of its Commitment and Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, such Lender may, (i) upon ten (10) days notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer. In the event of any
such resignation as L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer hereunder with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and such
Lender; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of such Lender as L/C Issuer. If such Lender resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit issued by such Lender outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to
require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer, (A) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of
the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer, (B) the retiring L/C Issuer shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and (C) the successor L/C Issuer shall
issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit issued by the retiring L/C Issuer, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the
obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit.  Section 11.07 Treatment of Certain
Information; Confidentiality.  (a) Treatment of Certain Information. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (i) to its Affiliates and to its Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons
to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (ii) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over
such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (iii) to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal
process, (iv) to any other party hereto, (v) in 
  164 





connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of
rights hereunder or thereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (A) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement or (B) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this
Agreement or payments hereunder, (vii) on a confidential basis to (1) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market identifiers with respect to the credit
facilities provided hereunder or (2) any administration, management or settlement service providers, (viii) with the consent of the Borrower or to the extent such Information (1) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a
breach of this Section or (2) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or any
Subsidiary thereof. For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or any of their respective businesses, other than
any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof; all information received from the
Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or any of their respective businesses shall be deemed Information for purposes of this Section 11.07(a) unless marked Public. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.  (b) Non-Public
Information. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that (i) the Information may include material non-public information concerning a Loan
Party or a Subsidiary thereof, as the case may be, (ii) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (iii) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States federal and state securities Laws. 
(c) Press Releases. The Loan Parties and their Affiliates agree that they will not in the future issue any press releases or other
public disclosure using the name of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender or their respective Affiliates or referring to this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents without the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent, unless (and only to the extent that) the Loan Parties or such Affiliates are required to do so under law and then, in any event the Loan Parties or such Affiliates will consult with such Person before issuing such press release or other
public disclosure.  (d) Customary Advertising Material. The Loan Parties consent to the publication by the Administrative Agent,
the Collateral Agent or any Lender of customary advertising material relating to the transactions contemplated hereby using the name, product photographs, logo or trademark of the Loan Parties; provided that, if any such advertising materials
include Borrowers results of operating or other non-public Information that is to be treated as confidential under this Section 11.07, the Borrowers consent shall be required prior to use of
such Information. 
  165 




Section 11.08 Right of Setoff. 
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, the L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other
obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any other Loan Party against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower or such Loan
Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender, the L/C Issuer or Affiliate shall have made any demand under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower or such Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured, secured or unsecured, or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender or the L/C Issuer different
from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that, in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (a) all amounts so set off shall be paid over
immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.14 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, and (b) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Secured Obligations owing to such Defaulting
Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender, the L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, the
L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer agrees to notify the Borrower or such Loan Party and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that, the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  Section 11.09 Interest Rate
Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under
the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest
in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or
received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest,
(b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

Section 11.10 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. 
This Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the L/C Issuer, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the
subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when
taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any certificate delivered thereunder, by fax transmission or other e-mail transmission (e.g., pdf or tif) shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement or such other Loan Document or certificate. Without limiting the
foregoing, to the extent an original executed counterpart is not specifically required to be delivered under the terms of any Loan Document, upon the request of any party, such fax transmission or e-mail
transmission shall be promptly followed by delivery of such original executed counterpart.  Section 11.11 Survival of
Representations and Warranties.  All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other
document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and
each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit
Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding. 
Section 11.12 Severability. 
If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality,
validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be
limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited. 
  167 




Section 11.13 Replacement of Lenders. 
If the Borrower is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.06, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such
Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.06), all of its interests, rights (other
than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender,
if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:  (a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment
fee (if any) specified in Section 11.06(b);  (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to 100% of the
outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the
extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);  (c) in the case
of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
(d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and 
(e) in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the
applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such
assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY 

indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Obligations. If the Secured Parties so request, any such obligation or indebtedness of any such
other Loan Party to the Subordinating Loan Party shall be enforced and performance received by the Subordinating Loan Party as trustee for the Secured Parties and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the Secured Parties on account of the
Secured Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of the Subordinating Loan Party under this Agreement. Without limitation of the foregoing, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, the Loan Parties may
make and receive payments with respect to Intercompany Debt; provided, that in the event that any Loan Party receives any payment of any Intercompany Debt at a time when such payment is prohibited by this Section, such payment shall be held
by such Loan Party, in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid forthwith over and delivered, upon written request, to the Administrative Agent.

Section 11.20 Time of the Essence. 
Time is of the essence of the Loan Documents. 
Section 11.21 Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial
Institutions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or
understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion
powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:  (a) the application
of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder that may be payable to it by 

ve to the same extent as the transfer would be effective
under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the

  172 





event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might
otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime

Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
