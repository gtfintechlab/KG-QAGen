irrevocable Loan Notice to the Lender. Each such Loan Notice must be received by the Lender not later than 11:00 a.m., New York
time, (i) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any such Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of any such Eurodollar
Rate Loans or of any conversion of any such Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans, and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing
of Base Rate Loans; provided that, a Loan Notice delivered on the Closing Date may request a Eurodollar Rate Loan on the
request date. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of any such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount
of $10,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Borrowing of or conversion to any such Base Rate Loans
shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Each Loan Notice shall specify
(i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Committed Loans or Term Loans from one Type to the other, the
conversion of Committed Loans to Term Loans or a continuation of Committed Loans or Term Loans as the same Type, (ii) the requested
date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount
of Committed Loans or Term Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing
Committed Loans or Term Loans are to be converted, and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto.
If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Committed Loan or Term Loan, in a Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely
notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Committed Loans or Term Loans, as applicable, shall be made
or continued as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the
last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a
Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest
Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.
 
(b)          Following
receipt of a Loan Notice and upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing
is the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01), the Lender shall make the funds available to the Borrower by wire transfer
of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to the Lender by the Borrower.
 
(c)          Except
as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of the Interest Period
for such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default or Event of Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to
or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the Lender, and the Lender may demand that any or all of the then
outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans be converted to Base Rate Loans at the end of the respective Interest Periods therefor, if at
the end of such periods, a Default or an Event of Default is then in existence.
 
(d)          The
Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower of the interest rate applicable to any Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate Loan upon determination
of such interest rate. The determination of the Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate by the Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. The Lender shall notify the Borrower of any change in its referenced prime rate used in determining the Base Rate
promptly following the public announcement of such change.
 
(e)          After
giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Committed Loans to Term Loans, all conversions of Committed Loans or Term Loans
from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Committed Loans or Term Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than
5 Interest Periods in effect with respect to Committed Loans or Term Loans, as applicable.
 
2.03         Intentionally
Omitted.
 
2.04         Intentionally
Omitted.
 

 31 
 

 
2.05         Prepayments.
 
(a)          The
Borrower may, upon notice to the Lender, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Committed Loans or Term Loans, in
whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by the Lender not later than
11:00 a.m., New York time, (A) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans, and (B) one Business
Day prior to any date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a
principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans
shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each such notice shall specify the
date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower
shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.
Any prepayment of Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any additional
amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05.
 
(b)          If
for any reason the Outstanding Amount of all Committed Loans at any time exceeds the Commitment then in effect, the Borrower shall
immediately prepay such Committed Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.
 
2.06         Reduction
or Termination of Commitments.
 
(a)          The
Borrower may, upon notice to Lender, terminate the Commitment, or permanently reduce the Commitment to an amount not less than
the then Outstanding Amount of all Loans; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Lender not later than
11:00 a.m., five Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, and (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an
aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Once reduced in accordance with this Section,
the Commitment may not be increased. All facility fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Commitment shall
be paid on the effective date of such termination.
 
(b)          The
Commitment shall automatically terminate on the Project Financing Maturity Date and any outstanding Loans shall be due and payable
on such date.
 
2.07         Repayment
of Loans.
 
(a)          The
Borrower shall repay to the Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Committed Loan or Term Loan on the Maturity Date for
such Loan.
 
(b)          On
or before the earlier of the Maturity Date and the Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date, Borrower may repay or prepay (without
premium or penalty), as applicable, all, but not less than all, of the then aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans by payment-in-kind
by transferring ownership of the Borrower’s entire direct and indirect interest in the Project to Lender.
 
2.08         Interest.
 
(a)          Subject
to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate for such Interest
Period plus the Applicable Rate; and (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof
from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
 

 32 
 

 
(b)          In
the event any amount due hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including, without limitation, any interest payment) is not
paid when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), the Borrower shall pay interest on such unpaid amount (including, without
limitation, interest on interest) at a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable
upon demand.
 
(c)          Interest
on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may
be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment,
and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.
 
2.09         Fees.
 
(a)          Facility
Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Lender for its account, a facility fee equal to the Applicable Rate multiplied by the actual
daily amount of the Commitment, regardless of usage. The facility fee shall accrue at all times from the Closing Date until the
Maturity Date provided that, if the Lender continues to have any Credit Extensions (including Term Loans) outstanding after
its Commitment terminates, then such Facility Fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of the Lender’s Credit Extensions
(including Term Loans), from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which the Lender
ceases to have any outstanding Credit Extensions (including Term Loans). The Facility Fee shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after
the Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date. The facility fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change
in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately
for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. The facility fee shall accrue at all times, including
at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met.
 
(b)          Term
Conversion Fee. If the Borrower exercises its option to convert outstanding Committed Loans into Term Loans pursuant to Section
2.01(b), then on the Term Conversion Date, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender, an amount (the “Term Conversion Fee”)
equal to the product of (i) 0.75% multiplied by (ii) the outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans that are being converted
to Term Loans as of such date.
 
(c)          Other
Fees. The Borrower shall pay a fee to the Lender in the amount and at the time specified in the Fee Letter.
 

 33 
 

 
2.10         Computation
of Interest and Fees.
Computation of interest on Base Rate Loans (other than Base Rate Loans determined by reference to
the Daily Floating Eurodollar Rate) shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and the
actual number of days elapsed. Computation of all other types of interest and all fees shall be calculated on the basis of a year
of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed, which results in a higher yield to the payee thereof than a method based on
a year of 365 or 366 days. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a
Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid
on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day.
 
2.11         Evidence
of Debt.
 
The Credit Extensions made by the Lender shall
be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by the Lender in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records
maintained by the Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lender to
the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure so to record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit
or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Loans. Upon the request
of the Lender, its Loans may be evidenced by a Note, in addition to such accounts or records. The Lender may attach schedules to
its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of the applicable Loans and payments with respect
thereto.
 
2.12         Payments
Generally.
 
(a)          All
payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Lender at the Lender’s
Lending Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 12:00 noon, New York time, on the date specified herein.
All payments received by the Lender after 12:00 noon, New York time, shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day
and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.
 
(b)          Subject
to the definition of “Interest Period,” if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other
than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in
computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
 
(c)          If
at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Lender to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and
fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, toward costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs and amounts
payable under Article III) incurred by the Lender, (ii) second, toward repayment of interest and fees then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (iii)
third, toward repayment of principal then due hereunder.
 
(d)          Nothing
herein shall be deemed to obligate the Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute
a representation by the Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.

Article
III
Taxes, Yield Protection and Illegality
 
3.01         Taxes.
 
(a)          Payments
Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes.
 
(i)          Any
and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes. If, however, applicable
Laws require the Borrower or the Lender to withhold or deduct any Tax, such Tax shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with
such Laws as determined by the Borrower or the Lender, as the case may be, upon the basis of the information and documentation
to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below.
 
(ii)         If
the Borrower or the Lender shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal
backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Borrower or the Lender shall withhold or make such
deductions as are determined by the Borrower or the Lender to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received
pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Borrower or the Lender shall timely pay the full amount withheld or
deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or
deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary
so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section) the Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding
or deduction been made.
 
(b)          Payment
of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely
pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws.
 
(c)          Tax
Indemnifications.
 
(i)          Without
limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, the Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Lender
and shall make payment in respect thereof within 30 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section)
withheld or deducted by the Borrower or the Lender or paid by the Lender and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted
by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower
by the Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 

 35 
 

 
(ii)         Without
limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, the Lender does hereby,
indemnify the Borrower and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, against any and all Taxes
and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements
of any counsel for the Borrower) incurred by or asserted against the Borrower by any Governmental Authority as a result of the
failure by the Lender to deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any documentation required to
be delivered by the Lender to the Borrower pursuant to subsection (e). The agreements in this clause (ii)
shall survive any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, the Lender, the termination of the Commitment and the repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
 
(d)          Evidence
of Payments.  Upon request by the Borrower or the Lender, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower
or by the Lender to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the Lender
or the Lender shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment
reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Lender, as the case may be.
 
(e)          Status
of Lender; Tax Documentation.
 
(i)          The
Lender shall deliver to the Borrower, at the time or times prescribed by applicable Laws or when reasonably requested by the Borrower,
such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Laws or by the taxing authorities of any jurisdiction
and such other reasonably requested information as will permit the Borrower to determine (A) whether or not payments made
hereunder or under any other Loan Document are subject to Taxes, (B) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction,
and (C) the Lender’s entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of all
payments to be made to the Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish the Lender’s status
for withholding tax purposes in the applicable jurisdiction.
 
(ii)         Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States,
 
(A)         if
Lender is a “United States person” within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code it shall deliver
to the Borrower (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which the Lender becomes
a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter at the time or times prescribed by applicable Laws or upon the
reasonable request of the Borrower) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or successor form) or such other documentation
or information prescribed by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will enable the Borrower to determine that
the Lender is not subject to backup withholding or to determine whether or not the Lender is subject to information reporting requirements;
and
 

 36 
 

 
(B)         if
Lender is a Foreign Lender that is entitled under the Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of withholding
tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document it shall deliver to the Borrower (in such number of copies
as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes the lender under this Agreement
(and from time to time thereafter at the time or times prescribed by applicable Laws or upon the request of the Borrower but only
if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(1)         executed
originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor form) claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty
to which the United States is a party,
 
(2)         executed
originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or successor form),
 
(3)         executed
originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or successor form) and all required supporting documentation,
 
(4)         in
the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code,
(x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of Section
881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section
881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C)
of the Code and (y) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor form), or
 
(5)         executed
originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States
federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit the Borrower
to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
 
(iii)        If
a payment made to the Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if the Lender
were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b)
or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), the Lender shall deliver to the Borrower at the time or times prescribed by law
and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed
by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower as may be
necessary for the Borrower to comply with its obligations under FATCA and to determine that the Lender has complied with the Lender’s
obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause
(iii), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 

 37 
 

 
(iv)        The
Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Borrower of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed
exemption or reduction, (B) in the event any form or certification previously delivered by it pursuant to this Section 3.01(e)
expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect or a Change in Law occurs requiring a change in such previously delivered
form or certification, deliver any such other properly completed and executed form, certification or documentation as may be required
in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of the Lender to an exemption from or a reduction in withholding Taxes with respect
to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Documents if the Lender continues to be so entitled, and (C) in the event the
Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of the Lender pursuant to Section 3.01(a) and (c),
take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of the Lender, and as may be reasonably
necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any jurisdiction
that the Borrower make any withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts payable to the Lender.
 
(f)          Treatment
of Certain Refunds. If the Lender determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund
of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only
to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect
to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Lender and without interest
(other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower,
upon the request of the Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges
imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Lender in the event the Lender is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Lender to make available its tax returns (or any
other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
 

 38 
 

 
3.02         Illegality.
If the Lender determines that any Law enacted, construed or announced after the Closing Date has made it unlawful, or that any
Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for the Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund
Eurodollar Rate Loans, or materially restricts the authority of the Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars
in the applicable offshore Dollar market, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice
thereof by the Lender to the Borrower, any obligation of the Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base
Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Lender notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise
to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from the Lender, prepay or,
if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if
the Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if the Lender may not lawfully
continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay interest on
the amount so prepaid or converted. If any such Law, or change therein, shall only affect a portion of the Lender’s obligations
under this Agreement which is, in the opinion of the Lender, severable from the remainder of this Agreement so that the remainder
of this Agreement may be continued in full force and effect without otherwise affecting any of the obligations of the Borrower,
the Lender shall only declare its obligations under that portion so terminated. The Lender agrees to designate a different Lending
Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of the Lender, otherwise
be disadvantageous to the Lender.
 
3.03         Inability
to Determine Rates. If the Lender determines in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion
to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore Dollar market for
the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining
the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately
and fairly reflect the cost to the Lender of funding such Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Lender will promptly notify the Borrower. Thereafter,
the obligation of the Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Lender revokes such notice.
Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may, without liability for any attendant breakage costs, revoke any pending request for
a Borrowing, conversion or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request
into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Lender has made the determination described in clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, the Lender, in consultation
with the Borrower and the Lender, may establish an alternative interest rate for the affected Loans (the “Impacted Loans”),
in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Lender revokes the
notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Lender notifies
the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lender of funding the Impacted
Loans, or (3) the Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it
is unlawful, for the Lender or its Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to
such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has
imposed material restrictions on the authority of the Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Borrower written notice
thereof.
 

 39 
 

 
3.04         Increased
Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.
 
(a)          If
the Lender determines that as a result of any Change in Law, or the Lender’s compliance therewith, there shall be any increase
in the cost to the Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans or a reduction in the amount
received or receivable by the Lender in connection with such Loans (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any such
increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 3.01 shall govern),
(ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction
or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of which the Lender is organized or has its Lending Office, and (iii)
reserve requirements contemplated by Section 3.04(c)), then from time to time upon demand of the Lender, the Borrower shall
pay to the Lender such additional amounts as will compensate the Lender for such increased cost or reduction.
 
(b)          If
the Lender determines that any Change in Law, or compliance by the Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of
reducing the rate of return on the capital of the Lender or any corporation controlling the Lender as a consequence of the Lender’s
obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and the Lender’s desired return
on capital), then from time to time upon demand of the Lender, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender such additional amounts as
will compensate the Lender for such reduction.
 
(c)          The
Borrower shall pay to the Lender, as long as the Lender shall be required under regulations of the Board to maintain reserves with
respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits, additional costs on the unpaid principal
amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by the Lender (as determined
by the Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest
is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have received at least 15 days’ prior notice of such additional
interest from the Lender. If the Lender fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional
interest shall be due and payable 15 days from receipt of such notice.
 
(d)          The
Lender shall use its reasonable efforts to reduce the amount it requests pursuant to this Section 3.04, including using
its reasonable efforts to not assign or transfer any Loan to any Person if such assignment or transfer would or would be likely
to increase the amount of such amounts payable; provided, however, the Lender shall have no obligation to take or
omit to take any action that the Lender in its good faith judgment believes would be disadvantageous to it. Each amount required
to be paid to the Lender pursuant to this Section 3.04 shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Lender setting forth
in reasonable detail the amount owed, the basis therefor and the calculations in respect thereto.
 
(e)          Failure
or delay on the part of the Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of the Lender’s
right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate the Lender pursuant to
this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that the Lender notifies the Borrower
of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of the Lender’s intention to claim compensation
therefor; provided further that, if the introduction of Law or change in (or change in interpretation of) Law giving

3.05         Funding
Losses. Upon demand of the Lender from time to time (which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Lender setting
forth in reasonable detail the amount demanded, the bases therefor and the calculations in respect thereto), the Borrower to whom
the subject Loan was made shall promptly compensate the Lender for and hold the Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense
incurred by it as a result of:
 
(a)          any
continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan made to such Borrower other than a Base Rate Loan or Daily Floating
Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic,
by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
 
(b)          any
failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of the Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert
any Loan made to the Borrower other than a Base Rate Loan or Daily Floating Eurodollar Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified
by the Borrower; or
 
(c)          any
assignment of a Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period as a result of a request
by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.15;
 
including any loss of anticipated profits and
any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable
to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged
by the Lender in connection with the foregoing.
 
For purposes of calculating
amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lender under this Section 3.05, the Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Fixed
Period Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing
in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Fixed Period
Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

Applicable to all Requests for Compensation.
 
(a)          A
certificate of the Lender claiming compensation under this Article III and setting forth in reasonable detail the additional
amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and such other information as otherwise specified in this Article III shall
be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, the Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution
methods customarily used by it in comparable circumstances.
 
(b)          Upon
the Lender’s making a claim for compensation under Section 3.01 or 3.04, the Borrower may remove or replace
the Lender in accordance with Section 10.15.

All of the Borrower’s obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Commitment and payment in
full of all the other Obligations.

(i) at the time thereof and immediately after giving effect thereto no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, and (ii) if the Borrower is involved in any such transaction, it is the surviving or resultant entity or the
recipient of any such sale, transfer, lease or other disposition of assets, and if one or more Material Subsidiaries is involved

7.03         Distributions.
During the existence of a Default which would become an Event of Default under clause (a), (f), or (g) of
Section 8.01 or a Default under Section 8.01(b) or 8.01(c) as a result of a breach of Section 7.09
or an Event of Default, the Borrower will not declare, pay or make any Distribution (in cash, property or obligations) on any interests
(now or hereafter outstanding) in the Borrower or apply any of its funds, property or assets to the purchase of any partnership
interests in the Borrower; provided that if the Borrower has declared a Distribution when no Default which would become
an Event of Default under clause (a), (f), or (g) of Section 8.01 or a Default under Section 8.01(b)
or 8.01(c) as a result of a breach of Section 7.09 or Event of Default exists, it shall be permitted to pay that
Distribution even if such Default or Event of Default exists on the corresponding payment date unless on such payment date and
prior to the making of such Distribution, the Borrower has knowledge that the maturity of all outstanding Obligations has been
accelerated pursuant to Section 8.02.
 
7.04         Change

the General Partner, the General Partner’s Subsidiaries, and the Delegate (in its capacity as such), to subordinated loans
(including Qualifying Subordinated Indebtedness) from an Affiliate to the Borrower, to a transaction between the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries and an Affiliate if such transaction has been approved by the Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors
of the Delegate, or to the MEP IPO Transactions or to transactions entered into with any MEP Unrestricted Subsidiary on terms and
conditions, taken as a whole, that are fair and reasonable to the Borrower and the Borrower’s Subsidiaries, taking into account
the totality of the relationship between the Borrower and the Borrower’s Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the MEP Unrestricted
Subsidiaries, on the other; provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall not purchase or prepay any
Qualifying Subordinated Indebtedness unless after giving effect to such purchase or payment, the Borrower is in compliance with
Section 7.09 and such purchase or payment will not result in a Default or an Event of Default. For purposes of clarification
of the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that the limitations contained in this Section 7.05 shall not limit the Delegate’s
authority to act or take actions on behalf of the General Partner.
 

 52 
 

 
7.06         Burdensome
Agreements. Enter into any material Contractual Obligation that by its express terms prohibits the Borrower or any Subsidiary
or Non-MEP Unrestricted Subsidiary to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist Liens on any material property of such Person to

support to, any Unrestricted Subsidiary, provided however that (i) the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary may grant
a Lien on the equity interests of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to secure Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and (ii) the
Borrower may provide credit support in the form of causing the issuance of Financial Support Agreement Letters of Credit and providing
Financial Support Agreement Parental Guaranties in accordance with the Financial Support Agreement for the benefit of Midcoast

Financial Support Agreement Letters of Credit or any Financial Support Agreement Parental Guarantees, or cause to be amended any
existing Financial Support Agreement Letters of Credit or any existing Financial Support Agreement Parental Guaranties, if doing
so would cause the sum of the Financial Support Agreement Letter of Credit Amount plus the Financial Support Agreement Parental
Guarantee Amount to exceed $700,000,000, unless consented to by the Lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
 
(b)          No
Unrestricted Subsidiary may, directly or indirectly, (i) make any loans or advances in the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary,

Leverage Ratio. As of the end of each applicable four-quarter period, the Borrower shall maintain a ratio of (a) (i) Consolidated
Funded Debt plus, without duplication, (ii) the principal amount of Funded Debt owed by the Borrower to Subsidiaries
which does not constitute Qualifying Subordinated Indebtedness, to (b) Pro Forma EBITDA of no greater than (1) during an Acquisition
Period, 5.50 to 1.00, and (2) during any period other than an Acquisition Period, 5.00 to 1.00; provided, that if at the
end of any such applicable four-quarter period the Borrower shall not have maintained such ratio, the Borrower will have a period
of 30 days following the later of the date a Responsible Officer has knowledge that such ratio has not been satisfied at the end
of such period and 30 days following the end of such period, to cure such failure on a pro forma basis by satisfying the following
clauses (i) or (ii), or any combination of such clauses, by (i) obtaining an equity contribution which qualifies as equity under
GAAP or (ii) incurring Qualifying Subordinated Indebtedness in a sufficient amount that (y) had the Borrower had such additional
equity or Qualifying Subordinated Indebtedness proceeds, or a combination of both, at or prior to the end date of such applicable
four-quarter period, and (z) had such amount been included in, and increased, Pro Forma EBITDA with respect to such applicable
four-quarter period, the Borrower would have been in compliance with this Section 7.09 for such four-quarter period and,
if the Borrower obtains such equity or such Qualifying Subordinated Indebtedness proceeds, or any combination thereof, during such
cure period, but in no event shall such period end later than 60 days following the end of the corresponding ending four-quarter
period, then it will be deemed to be in compliance with this Section 7.09 as of the end of such four quarter period.
 
7.10         Indebtedness
of Non-OLP Subsidiaries. As of the end of each fiscal quarter, the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Non-OLP Subsidiaries
(other than Non-OLP Inter-Company Indebtedness) shall not exceed an amount (the “Non-OLP Indebtedness Limitation”)
equal to 0.5 times Non-OLP Pro Forma EBITDA for the four quarters then ended; provided, that to the extent that such Indebtedness
of the Non-OLP Subsidiaries does exceed the Non-OLP Indebtedness Limitation (the amount of such excess being referred to this Section
7.10 as “excess Indebtedness”) at quarter-end, the Non-OLP Subsidiaries may cure such excess Indebtedne

cash equivalents shall be held by the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership Subsidiaries until
the calculation is done pursuant to this Section 7.11 at the end of the next quarter, or (ii) by reducing the aggregate
outstanding amount of Indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership Subsidiaries by an amount equal to
such excess Indebtedness less the amount of cash or cash equivalents infused for such quarter-end pursuant to the preceding proviso,
if any. If the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership Subsidiaries so timely cure such excess Indebtedness by making
such infusion or reduction, or both as applicable, the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership Subsidiaries shall be
deemed to be in compliance with this Section 7.11 as of such quarter-end date.

(b)          Assignment
by Lender. The Lender may at any time assign to one assignee all, but not less than all of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall
be subject to the following conditions:
 
(i)          Intentionally
Omitted.
 
(ii)         Intentionally
Omitted.
 
(iii)        Required
Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment, except the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment,
or (2) such assignment is to an Affiliate of the Lender that is financially capable of performing the obligations of the Lender
under this Agreement.
 
(iv)        Assignment
and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Borrower an Assignment and Assumption.
 
(v)         No
Assignment to Borrower. No such assignment shall be made to the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

 62 
 

 
From and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and have the rights and
obligations of the Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall be released from its obligations under
this Agreement (and such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 10.04 and 10.05 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective
date of such assignment. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. If
the assigning Lender holds a Note and has assigned all of its Commitment, it shall promptly deliver such Note to the Borrower marked
“Cancelled” or sign a lost note affidavit (which shall include customary indemnification of the Borrower) with respect
thereto (provided however that, notwithstanding herein to the contrary, failure to do so will not affect the validity
of such assignment). Any assignment or transfer by the Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply
with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by the Lender of a participation in such rights
and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.
 
(c)          Intentionally
Omitted.
 
(d)          Participations.
The Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower, sell participations to any Person (other than a
natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”)
in all or a portion of the Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment
and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) the Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(ii) the Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the
Borrower shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Lender in connection with the Lender’s rights and obligations
under this Agreement.
 
Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which the Lender sells such a participation shall provide that the Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement
or instrument may provide that the Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other
modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e)
of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04
and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.01(e)
(it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the participating Lender))
to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this
Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09 as
though it were a Lender.
 
(e)          Limitations
upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01, 3.04
or 3.05 than the Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent.
 

 63 
 

 
(f)          Certain
Pledges. The Lender may at any time assign, pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement (including under its Notes, if any) to secure obligations of the Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release the Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for the Lender as a party hereto; and provided, further,
all costs, fees and expenses related to, or in connection with, any such pledge or grant shall be for the sole account of the Lender.
 
(g)          Electronic
Execution of Assignments. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like
import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic
form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of
a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the
Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or
any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
 

10.08         Confidentiality.
The Lender (on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates or its other Related Parties, and each of its and their directors,
officers, agents, attorneys, employees and representatives) agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined
below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates’ and other Related Parties’, directors,
officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons
to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to (and will agree
to) keep such Information confidential on the terms provided in this Section); (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority;
(c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process (and each such case,
such Person shall endeavor to notify the Borrower of such occurrence as soon as reasonably possible following the service of any
such process on such Person); (d) to any other party to this Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder
or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder; (f) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, or any
prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any direct or
indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such contractual counterparty’s or prospective counterparty’s
professional advisor) to any credit derivative, credit insurance transaction, or other substantially similar transaction relating
to the obligations of the Borrower, in each case, provided that each such Person first agrees to hold, and cause to be
held, such Information in confidence on the terms provided in this Section and such Person is not a competitor or Affiliate thereof
of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is engaged in the storage, transportation and/or distribution of hydrocarbons
as its primary business (and the Lender may rely on such Person’s representation as to the same); (g) with the consent of
the Borrower; (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section
or (ii) becomes available to the Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower; or (i) to the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar organization or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires
access to information about the Lender’s or its Affiliates’ investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued
with respect to the Lender or its Affiliates. For the purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information
received from the Borrower after the date hereof, if such information is clearly identified in writing at the time of delivery
as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality
of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
 

 64 
 

 
The Lender acknowledges
that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be,
(b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material
non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws.
 
10.09         Set-off.
In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lender provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event
of Default, the Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being
waived by the Borrower to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time
or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, the Lender to or for the credit
or the account of the Borrower against any and all Obligations then due and owing to the Lender. The Lender agrees promptly to
notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application made by the Lender; provided, however, that the failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
 
10.10         Interest
Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to
be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum amount, or be computed at a rate that exceeds the maximum rate, of
non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the “Maximum Rate”). If the Lender shall contract for, charge,
receive, reserve or take interest in an amount or at a rate that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied
to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower, and in no event shall the Borrower
or any other Person ever be liable for unearned interest or ever be required to pay interest in excess of the Maximum Rate. In
determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, received, reserved or taken by the Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, it
may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium
rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread
in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations. If the Laws of the
State of Texas are applicable for purposes of determining the “Maximum Rate”, then that term means the “indicated
rate ceiling” from time to time in effect under Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code. The Borrower agrees that Chapter 346
of the Texas Finance Code does not apply to any Borrowing.
 
10.11         Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
 
10.12         Integration.
This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict
between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control;
provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Lender in any other Loan Document shall not
be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties
thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.
 

 65 
 

 
10.13         Survival
of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery
hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Lender, regardless of any investigation
made by the Lender or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event
of Default at the time of any Credit Extension.
 
10.14         Severability.
Any provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as
to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
thereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision
in any other jurisdiction.
 
10.15         Replacement
and Removal of Lender. (a) If (1) the Borrower has a right to remove or replace a Lender pursuant to Section 3.06(b)
or under any other circumstances set forth in this Agreement providing that the Borrower shall have the right to remove or replace
a Lender as a party to this Agreement, the Borrower may, upon notice to the Lender, (i) remove the Lender by terminating the Lender’s
Commitment or (ii) replace the Lender by causing the Lender to assign its Commitment pursuant to Section 10.07(b) to an
Eligible Assignee procured by the Borrower. As a condition to the effectiveness of any such assignment or termination:
 
(w) in the event
of an assignment of the Lender’s Commitment or Loans, the assigning Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal
to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding
principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts),
 
(x) in the event
of a termination of the Lender’s Commitment which has not been assigned, pay in full all principal, interest, fees and other
amounts owing to the Lender through the date of termination or assignment (including any amounts payable pursuant to Section
3.05, which amounts shall be paid when billed in accordance with such Section), and (ii) provide written notice terminating
the Lender’s Commitment.
 
The Lender being replaced shall execute and
deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to the Lender’s Commitment and outstanding Credit Extensions. The Lender
shall distribute an amended Schedule 2.01, which shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement, to reflect changes in
the identity of the Lender and any adjustments of its Commitment resulting from any such removal or replacement.
 
(b)          Intentionally
Omitted.
 
(c)          Intentionally
Omitted.
 
(d)          This
section shall supersede any provision in Section 10.01 to the contrary.

Affiliates, and the Lender has no obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or its Affiliates. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, each of the Borrower and the Lender hereby waives and releases any claims that they may have against each
other with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction
contemplated hereby. The Lender acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors
