The parties hereto agree as follows: 
ARTICLE I  Definitions
 SECTION 1.01.    Defined Terms. As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings specified
below:  ABR when used in reference to any Loan or Borrowing, refers to such Loan, or the Loans comprising such
Borrowing, bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate.  Acquisition Holiday has the
meaning assigned to such term in the Section 6.10(a).  Adjusted LIBO Rate means, with respect to any Eurodollar
Borrowing for any Interest Period, an interest rate per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to (a) the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period multiplied by (b) the Statutory Reserve Rate. 
Administrative Agent means JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (including its branches and affiliates), in its capacity as
administrative agent for the Lenders hereunder.  Administrative Questionnaire means an Administrative Questionnaire in
a form supplied by the Administrative Agent.  Affiliate means, with respect to a specified Person, another Person that
directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls or is Controlled by or is under common Control with the Person specified. For purposes hereof, all Unrestricted Subsidiaries shall be considered Affiliates of the Borrower and the
Restricted Subsidiaries.  Agents means the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent. 
Agent Party has the meaning assigned to such term in Section 9.01(d). 
Aggregate Revolving Commitment means the aggregate of the Revolving Commitments of all of the Revolving Lenders, as reduced
or increased from time to time pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof. As of the Effective Date, the Aggregate Revolving Commitment is $300,000,000. 
Alternate Base Rate means, for any day, a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such
day, (b) the NYFRB Rate in effect on such day plus  1⁄2 of 1% and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one month Interest Period on such day (or if such
day is not a Business 



Day, the immediately preceding Business Day) plus 1%, provided that for the purpose of this definition, the Adjusted LIBO Rate for any day shall be based on the LIBO Screen Rate (or if the
LIBO Screen Rate is not available for such one month Interest Period, the Interpolated Rate) at approximately 11:00 a.m. London time on such day, subject to the interest rate floors set forth therein. Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a
change in the Prime Rate, the NYFRB Rate or the Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be effective from and including the effective date of such change in the Prime Rate, the NYFRB Rate or the Adjusted LIBO Rate, respectively. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
Alternate Base Rate shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of this Agreement. 
Anti-Corruption Laws means all laws, rules, and regulations of any jurisdiction applicable to the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries from time to time concerning or relating to bribery or corruption.  Applicable Percentage means, with
respect to any Revolving Lender, the percentage of the Aggregate Revolving Commitment represented by such Lenders Revolving Commitment (if the Revolving Commitments have terminated or expired, the Applicable Percentages shall be determined
based upon the Revolving Commitments most recently in effect, giving effect to any assignments); provided that in the case of Section 2.23 when a Defaulting Lender shall exist, any such Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment shall
be disregarded in the calculation.  Applicable Pledge Percentage means (a) 100% in the case of a pledge by the Borrower
or any Subsidiary Guarantor of its Equity Interests in a Domestic Subsidiary that is a Restricted Subsidiary (other than a (i) Disregarded Domestic Subsidiary or (ii) a Domestic Subsidiary that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of a
Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC) and (b) 65% in the case of a pledge by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor of its Equity Interests in a Restricted Subsidiary that is (i) a Disregarded Domestic Subsidiary or (ii) a Foreign Subsidiary
that is a CFC.  Applicable Rate means, for any day, with respect to any Eurodollar Loan or any ABR Loan or with respect
to the commitment fees payable hereunder, as the case may be, the applicable rate per annum set forth below under the caption Eurodollar Spread, ABR Spread or Commitment Fee Rate, as the case may be, based upon

on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to
prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by an Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Banks standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A
Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (i) the amount of the LC Exposure shall not exceed $10,000,000, (ii) with respect to each Issuing Bank, (x) the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank at
such time plus (y) the aggregate amount of all LC Disbursements made by such Issuing Bank that have not yet been reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower at such time shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Commitment of such Issuing Bank,
(iii) no Revolving Lenders Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed its Revolving Commitment, and (iv) the Total Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitment. The Borrower may, at any time and from time
to time, increase or reduce the Letter of Credit Commitment of any Issuing Bank pursuant to the definition of Letter of Credit Commitment; provided that the Borrower shall not reduce the Letter of Credit Commitment of any Issuing Bank if,
after giving effect of such reduction, the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) above shall not be satisfied. 
(c)    Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire (or be subject to termination by notice from the
applicable Issuing Bank to the beneficiary thereof) at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one
year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date; provided that, any Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may provide for the
automatic renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) above);
provided further that, any Letter of Credit may extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) above if such Letter of Credit is cash collateralized, no 
  36 



later than thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date, in an amount equal to 105% of the face amount of such Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 2.06(j) hereof and on terms and
conditions reasonably acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent. 
(d)    Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the
amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a
participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date
due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to
this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a
Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. 
(e)    Reimbursement. If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit issued by
such Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent in Dollars the amount equal to such LC Disbursement, calculated as of the date such Issuing Bank made such LC Disbursement not later than
12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by
the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day
of receipt; provided that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an
equivalent amount of such LC Disbursement and, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the Borrower fails to make
such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lenders Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following
receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender
(and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to such Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.
Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to such Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made
payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank for any LC
Disbursement (other than the funding of Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. 
(f)    Obligations Absolute. The Borrowers obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in
paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and 
  37 



irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or
enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein
being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by any Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event
or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers obligations
hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders nor the Issuing Banks, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of
Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable
Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse such Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in
respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Banks failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented
under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction),
such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination applicable to any Letters of Credit. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents
presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, such Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. 
(g)    Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine
all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such
Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with
respect to any such LC Disbursement.  (h)    Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to
but excluding the date that the reimbursement is due and payable, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans and such interest shall be due and payable on the date when such reimbursement is payable; provided that, if the
Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Bank, except that
interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. 
  38 


(i)    Replacement and Resignation of Issuing Bank.
 (i)    Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the
Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and
obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any
previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the
rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit then outstanding and issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. 
(ii)    Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, the any Issuing Bank may
resign as an Issuing Bank at any time upon thirty days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Revolving Lenders, in which case, such Issuing Bank shall be replaced in accordance with Section 2.06(i)(i) above.
 (j)    Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that
the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the
deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders (the LC Collateral
Account), an amount in cash equal to 105% of the amount of the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective
immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of
Article VII. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of
withdrawal, over such account and the Borrower hereby grants the Administrative Agent a security interest in the LC Collateral Account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option
and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrowers risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse any applicable Issuing Bank (ratably in the case of more than one Issuing Bank) for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the
satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of
the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Secured Obligations. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. 
  39 


(k)    Issuing Bank Agreements. Unless otherwise requested by the
Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) promptly following the end of each calendar month, the aggregate amount of Letters of Credit issued by it and outstanding at the end of such month,
(ii) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank expects to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, and the aggregate face amount of the Letter of Credit to
be issued, amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension occurred (and whether the amount thereof changed), it being understood that such Issuing Bank shall not permit any
issuance, renewal, extension or amendment resulting in an increase in the amount of any Letter of Credit to occur without first obtaining written confirmation from the Administrative Agent that it is then permitted under this Agreement,
(iii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any payment under any Letter of Credit, the date of such payment under such Letter of Credit and the amount of such payment, (iv) on any Business Day on which the Borrower fails
to reimburse any payment under any Letter of Credit required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such failure and the amount of such payment and (v) on any other Business Day, such other information as the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.  SECTION 2.07.    Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender
shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 2:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such
purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05. Except in respect of the provisions of this Agreement covering the reimbursement of Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent
will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the funds so received in the aforesaid account of the Administrative Agent to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City or Chicago and
designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the
applicable Issuing Bank.  (b)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the
proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to
the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance
with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the applicable Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such
Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing.  SECTION 2.08.    Interest Elections. (a) Each Borrowing
(other than a Swingline Loan) initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the
Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options
with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the 
  40 



Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be
converted or continued.  (b)    To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type and Class resulting from such election to be made on the
effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy or other electronic communication to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest
Election Request signed by the Borrower. Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, this Section shall not be construed to permit the Borrower to (i) elect an Interest Period for Eurodollar Loans that does not comply with
Section 2.02(d), (ii) convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a Type not available under the Class of Commitments pursuant to which such Borrowing was made or (iii) convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Class. 
(c)    Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with
Section 2.02:  (i)    the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if
different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall
be specified for each resulting Borrowing);  (ii)    the effective date of the election made pursuant
to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;  (iii)    whether the resulting
Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and  (iv)    if the resulting Borrowing
is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which Interest Period shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period. 
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one months duration.  (d)    Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing. 
(e)    If the Borrower fails to deliver an Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the
end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall remain a Eurodollar Borrowing with the same Interest Period applicable to the
respective Eurodollar Borrowing for the Interest Period then ended. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so
notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an
ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. 
  41 


SECTION 2.09.    Termination and Reduction of Commitments.
(a) Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.  (b)    The
Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments of any Class; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not
less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the Total Revolving Credit Exposure would
exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitment.  (c)    The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election
to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly
following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination
of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or other transactions specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked or delayed by the Borrower (by
notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of any
Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders holding such Commitments in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class. 
SECTION 2.10.    Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay
(i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan
on the fifth Business Day after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then
outstanding and the proceeds of any such Borrowing shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to repay any Swingline Loans outstanding. 
(b)    Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness
of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. 
(c)    The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in the Register established and maintained in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9.04(b)(iv) in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable
or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lenders share thereof. 
(d)    The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be
prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner
affect the Obligations.  (e)    Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In
such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note 
  42 



payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Thereafter,
the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form. 
SECTION 2.11.    Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time
to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to prior notice in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.11(a). The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a
Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by written notice (promptly followed by telephonic confirmation of such request) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York
City time, three (3) Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, one (1) Business Day before the date of prepayment or
(iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each
Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments of any Class as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice
of prepayment may be revoked or delayed if such notice of termination is revoked or delayed in accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the
applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing of any Class shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type and Class as provided in
Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Borrowing of any Class shall be applied ratably to the Loans of such Class included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by (i) accrued interest to the extent required by
Section 2.13 and (ii) break funding payments, if any, pursuant to Section 2.16. If at any time the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all of the Revolving Credit Exposures exceeds the Aggregate Revolving Commitment, the Borrower
shall immediately repay Borrowings, or cash collateralize LC Exposure, in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.06(j), as applicable, in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to cause the aggregate principal amount
of all Revolving Credit Exposures to be less than or equal to the Aggregate Revolving Commitment.  (b)    The Borrower
shall apply all proceeds from any issuance or incurrence of Refinancing Notes, Refinancing Term Loans and Replacement Revolving Commitments (other than solely by means of extending or renewing then existing Refinancing Notes, Refinancing Term Loans
and Replacement Revolving Commitments without resulting in any proceeds), no later than three (3) Business Days after the date on which such Refinancing Notes, Refinancing Term Loans and Replacement Revolving Commitments are issued or incurred,
to prepay Term Loans and/or terminate Revolving Commitments being refinanced in accordance with Section 2.22 and the definition of Refinancing Notes (as applicable). 
SECTION 2.12.    Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
Revolving Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the Available Revolving Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which the Revolving Commitment of
such Lender terminates; provided that, if such Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Revolving Commitment terminates, then such commitment fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lenders
Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its Revolving Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on
the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such 
  43 



date to occur after the date hereof; provided that any commitment fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All commitment fees
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). 
(b)    The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a
participation fee with respect to its participations in issued and outstanding Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the average daily amount
of such Lenders LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lenders Revolving
Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure and (ii) to each Issuing Bank for its own account a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate per annum separately agreed between the Borrower and the
applicable Issuing Bank on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the period from and including
the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as such Issuing Banks standard fees and commissions with respect to the
issuance, amendment, cancellation, negotiation, transfer, presentment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June,
September and December of each year shall be payable on the third (3rd) Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to
any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within ten (10) days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of
days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  (c)    The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. 
(d)    All fees payable hereunder or in connection therewith shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available
funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to an Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution to the applicable parties. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances. 
SECTION 2.13.    Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall
bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.  (b)    The Loans comprising each Eurodollar
Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate. 
(c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) during the occurrence and continuance of any Event of Default described in
paragraph (a), (h), (i), or (j) of Article VII, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable
to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (y) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section and (ii) during the occurrence and
continuance of any other Event of Default, the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, may, at its option, 
  44 



by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 9.02 requiring the consent of each Lender directly
affected thereby for reductions in interest rates), declare that (x) all Loans shall bear interest at 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loans as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (y) in the case of
any other amount outstanding hereunder, such amount shall accrue at 2% plus the rate applicable to such fee or other obligation as provided hereunder. 
(d)    Accrued interest on each Loan of any Class shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such
Loan and on the Maturity Date (or, if earlier, upon termination of the Commitments of such Class); provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of
any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or
prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. 
(e)    All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by
reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual
number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.  SECTION 2.14.    Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest
Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:  (a)    the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or 
(b)    the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as
applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; 
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy or other electronic communication as promptly
as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any
Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and any such Eurodollar Borrowing shall be repaid on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto and (ii) if any Borrowing
Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.  SECTION
2.15.    Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall: 
(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, liquidity or similar requirement
(including any compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or
any Issuing Bank; 
  45 


(ii)    impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the
London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; or 
(iii)    subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes
described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or
capital attributable thereto;  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making,
continuing, converting into or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan or to increase the cost to such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of
Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient hereunder, whether of principal, interest or otherwise, then the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such
other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
(b)    If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has
or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or such Issuing Banks capital or on the capital of such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the
Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding
company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or such Issuing Banks policies and the policies of such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company with respect to capital
adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lenders or such
Issuing Banks holding company for any such reduction suffered.  (c)    A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing
Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall
be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 
(d)    Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section
shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or such Issuing Banks right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any
increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such
Lenders or such Issuing Banks intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
  46 


SECTION 2.16.    Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the
payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or as a result of any prepayment pursuant to Section 2.11), (b) the
conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto
(regardless of whether such notice may be revoked or extended under Section 2.11 and is revoked or extended in accordance therewith but not including any such failure that results from a notice under Section 2.14) or (d) the
assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the
loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the
principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the
case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which
such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in Dollars of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such
Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days
after receipt thereof.  SECTION 2.17.    Taxes. (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by
or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an
applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full
amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such
deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.17) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deduction or withholding been made.  (b)    Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. The Borrower shall timely
pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes. 
(c)    Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental
Authority pursuant to this Section 2.17, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such
payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(d)    Indemnification by the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after
receipt of a written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be
withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant

  47 



Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount and type of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(e)    Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10
days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the
obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable
to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative
Agent under this paragraph (e).  (f)    Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption
from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such
properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to
determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation
(other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material
unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
(ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person:
 (A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on
or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), an executed IRS Form
W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax; 
(B)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 
  48 


(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the
United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, an executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form
W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty
and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as
applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; 
(2) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming that its extension of credit will generate U.S. effectively connected income, an executed IRS
Form W-8ECI;  (3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for
portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning
of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a
U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) an executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable;
or  (4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, an executed IRS
Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit
E-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and
one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit
E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
(C)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary
documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
(D)    if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding
Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section
1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably 
  49 



requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such
Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the
date of this Agreement.  Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or
inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
(g)    Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that
it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.17 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal
to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect
to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant
Governmental Authority) in 

ent that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required
to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would
have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This
paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
(h)    Survival. Each partys obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive the resignation or
replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
(i)    Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 2.17, the term applicable law includes FATCA.
 SECTION 2.18.    Payments Generally; Allocations of Proceeds; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.  (a)    The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time on the date when due, in immediately
available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or
Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received
by it for the 
  50 



account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars. 
(b)    Any proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent (i) not constituting a specific payment of
principal, interest, fees or other sum payable under the Loan Documents (which shall be applied as specified by the Borrower) or (ii) after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent so elects or the
Required Lenders so direct, such funds shall be applied, subject to the provisions of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, ratably first, to pay any fees, indemnities, or expense reimbursements including amounts then due to the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks from the Borrower, second, to pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to the Lenders from the Borrower, third, to pay interest then due and payable on the Loans ratably, fourth,
to prepay principal on the Loans and unreimbursed LC Disbursements and any other amounts owing with respect to Banking Services Obligations and Swap Obligations ratably, fifth, to pay an amount to the Administrative Agent equal to one hundred
five percent (105%) of the aggregate undrawn face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit and the aggregate amount of any unpaid LC Disbursements, to be held as cash collateral for such Obligations, and sixth, to the payment of any other
Secured Obligation (other than any Unliquidated Obligations) due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender by the Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, amounts received from any Loan Party shall not be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligation of
such Loan Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless so directed by the Borrower, or unless an Event of Default is in existence, none of the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall apply any payment which it
receives to any Eurodollar Loan of a Class, except (a) on the expiration date of the Interest Period applicable to any such Eurodollar Loan or (b) in the event, and only to the extent, that there are no outstanding ABR Loans of the same
Class and, in any event, the Borrower shall pay the break funding payment required in accordance with Section 2.16. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and reverse and reapply any
and all such proceeds and payments to any portion of the Secured Obligations.  (c)    To the extent agreed by the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower (in its sole discretion), all payments of principal, interest, LC Disbursements, fees, premiums, reimbursable expenses (including, without limitation, all reimbursement for fees and expenses pursuant to
Section 9.03), and other sums payable under the Loan Documents, may be paid from the proceeds of Borrowings made hereunder whether made following a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.03 or a deemed request as provided in this
Section or may be deducted from any deposit account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, the Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes (i) the Administrative Agent to make a
Borrowing for the purpose of paying each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents and agrees that all such amounts charged shall constitute Loans (including Swingline Loans)
and that all such Borrowings shall be deemed to have been requested pursuant to Sections 2.03 or 2.05, as applicable and (ii) the Administrative Agent to charge any deposit account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent
for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents. 
(d)    If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or
otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans of any Class or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate
amount of its Loans of such Class and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon, as the case may be, than the proportion 
  51 



received by any other similarly situated Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of such Class and
participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders, as the case may be, to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by all such applicable Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate
amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans of such Class and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, as the case may be; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all
or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be
construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans
or participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the
foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of
set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
(e)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment
is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance
herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks,
as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to
it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
(f)    If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or
(e), 2.07(b), 2.18(e) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for
the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Banks to satisfy such Lenders obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a
segregated account over which the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive control as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section; in the case of each of clauses (i) and
(ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.  SECTION
2.19.    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or
any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then, at the request of the Borrower, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder
or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, or otherwise mitigate such circumstances, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby
agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
  52 


(b)    If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15,
(ii) the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then
the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 2.15 or 2.17) and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be
another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld delayed or conditioned) of the Administrative Agent (and
if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender), in each case to the extent that such consent would be required for such assignment pursuant to Section 9.04, (ii) such Lender shall have received
payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent
of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to
be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender
or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall break funding payments, if any, pursuant to
Section 2.16 be due and payable to any such assignor.  SECTION 2.20.    Incremental Commitments. 
(a)    The Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent from time to time, request Incremental Term Loan
Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Commitments, as applicable, in an amount not to exceed the Incremental Amount available at the time such Incremental Term Loans are funded or Incremental Revolving Commitments are established from one or more
Incremental Term Lenders and/or Incremental Revolving Lenders (which, in each case, may include any existing Lender, but shall be required to be Persons which would qualify as assignees of a Lender in accordance with Section 9.04) willing to
provide such Incremental Term Loans and/or Incremental Revolving Commitments, as the case may be, in their sole discretion, all of the proceeds of which shall be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and for the payment of fees and
expenses in connection with such Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Commitments; provided that each Incremental Revolving Lender providing a commitment to make revolving loans shall, to the extent the same would be
required for an assignment under Section 9.04, be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Such notice shall
set forth (i) the amount of the Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Commitments being requested (which shall be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000, or equal to the remaining Incremental Amount or, in each case, such
lesser amount approved by the Administrative Agent), (ii) the date on which such Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Commitments are requested to become effective and (iii) in the case of Incremental Term Loan
Commitments, whether such Incremental Term Loan Commitments are to be (x) commitments to make the initial Incremental Term Loans hereunder or term loans with terms identical to (and which shall together with any then outstanding Incremental
Term Loans, as applicable, form a single Class of) the then initial Incremental Term Loans (if any) or (y) commitments to make term loans with pricing, maturity, amortization, participation in mandatory prepayments, prepayment premiums and
penalties and/or other terms different from the then outstanding Incremental Term Loans (if any) (Other Incremental Term Loans). 
  53 


(b)    The Borrower and each Incremental Term Lender and/or Incremental
Revolving Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such
Incremental Term Lender and/or Incremental Revolving Commitment of such Incremental Revolving Lender. Each Incremental Assumption Agreement shall specify the terms of the applicable Incremental Term Loans and/or Incremental Revolving Commitments;
provided, that:  (i)    any (x) commitments to make additional Incremental Term Loans (as
opposed to Other Incremental Term Loans) shall have the same terms as the then outstanding Incremental Term Loans, and shall form part of the same Class of Incremental Term Loans and (y) Incremental Revolving Commitments shall have the
same terms as the then outstanding Class of Revolving Commitments (or, if more than one Class of Revolving Commitments is then outstanding, the Revolving Commitments with the then latest maturity date) and shall require no scheduled
amortization or mandatory commitment reduction prior to the latest maturity date applicable to the Commitments or Loans of any Class hereunder; 
(ii)    the Incremental Term Loans (other than the Other Incremental Term Loans), unless agreed to by any
such Other Incremental Term Loan Lenders, incurred pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 2.20 shall rank equally and ratably in right of security with the existing Loans; 
(iii)    the final maturity date of any such Incremental Term Loans (other than Other Incremental Term
Loans) shall be no earlier than the latest maturity date applicable to the Commitments or Loans of any Class hereunder and in effect at the date of incurrence of such Incremental Term Loans (but may have amortization and customary prepayments
prior to such date) and, except as to pricing, prepayment premiums and penalties, amortization, final maturity date and participation in mandatory prepayments (which shall, subject to the other clauses of this proviso, be determined by the Borrower
and the applicable Incremental Term Lenders in their sole discretion), shall have (x) substantially the same terms as the Revolving Loans (in the case of the initial Incremental Term Loans) or the initial Incremental Term Loans or (y) such
other terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; provided that (i) if the interest rate margins in respect of any Incremental Term Loans incurred on or prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after
the Effective Date (determined with reference to each pricing tier of any applicable pricing grid) exceeds the interest rate margins for any other Incremental Term Loans outstanding at such time (the Existing Incremental Term
Loans) (as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent) by more than 0.50%, then the interest rate margins for the Existing Incremental Term Loans shall be increased (including by way of inclusion of a pricing grid) so that the
interest rate margins in respect of such Existing Incremental Term Loans are equal to the interest rate margins for such Incremental Term Loans minus 0.50% (determined at each level of each applicable pricing grid); provided
further that in determining the interest rate margin(s) applicable to each Incremental Term Loan and the interest rate margin(s) for the Existing Incremental Term Loans, (1) original issue discount (OID) or upfront
fees (which shall be deemed to constitute like amounts of OID) payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under such Incremental Term Loans or the Existing Incremental Term Loans in each case in the initial primary syndication thereof shall be included
(with OID being equated to interest based on assumed four-year life to maturity, or, if the remaining life to maturity is less than four years, based on the actual Weighted Life to Maturity), (2) customary arrangement, underwriting, commitment
or any similar fees payable to any arranger (or its affiliates) in connection with the Incremental Term Loans or to one or more arrangers (or their affiliates) of any Existing Incremental Term Loans shall be excluded and (3) if the Incremental
Term Loans include an interest rate floor greater than the applicable interest rate floor under the Existing Incremental 
  54 



Term Loans, such differential between interest rate floors shall be equated to the applicable interest rate margin for purposes of determining whether an increase to the interest rate margin
under the Existing Incremental Term Loans shall be required, but only to the extent an increase in the interest rate floor in the Existing Incremental Term Loans would cause an increase in the interest rate then in effect thereunder, and in such
case the interest rate floor (but not the interest rate margin) applicable to the Existing Incremental Term Loans shall be increased to the extent of such differential between interest rate floors; 
(iv)    the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any such Other Incremental Term Loans shall be no shorter
than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Term Loans with the longest remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity, 
(v)    the Borrower shall be in compliance immediately prior to and after giving effect (including giving
effect on a pro forma basis) to the incurrence of such Incremental Facility and the use of proceeds thereof with the financial covenants set forth in Section 6.10 (without giving effect to any Acquisition Holiday) as of the last day of the
fiscal quarter most recently ended for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b) (or, if prior to the date of the delivery of the first financial statements to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b),
the most recent financial statements referred to in Section 3.04), as applicable;  (vi)     there
shall be no borrower (other than the Borrower) or guarantor (other than the Loan Parties) in respect of any Incremental Term Loan Commitments or Incremental Revolving Commitments; 
(vii)    any Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be an unrestricted subsidiary under the terms of any
Incremental Facility; and  (viii)    Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Revolving Commitments shall
not be secured by any asset of the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries other than the Collateral;  Each party hereto hereby agrees that, concurrently
with the effectiveness of any Incremental Assumption Agreement, this Agreement shall be amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving
Commitments evidenced thereby as provided for in Section 9.02(f). Any amendment to this Agreement or any other Loan Document that is necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 2.20 and any such collateral and other documentation shall
be deemed Loan Documents hereunder and may be memorialized in writing by the Administrative Agent with the Borrowers consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), but without the consent of any other Party, and
furnished to the other parties hereto.  (c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incremental Term Loan Commitment or
Incremental Revolving Commitment shall become effective under this Section 2.20 unless (i) no Event of Default shall exist; (ii) the representations and warranties of the Borrower set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct
in all material respects (or in all respects if the applicable representation and warranty is qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect), except to the extent that such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in
which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects (or in all respects if the applicable representation and warranty is qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect) as of such earlier date, in
each case on or as of the date of incurrence of such Incremental Term Loan Commitment or Incremental Revolving Commitment; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the tranche of Incremental Term Loans is used to
finance a Permitted Acquisition or other investment 
  55 



permitted hereby, the foregoing shall be limited such that (x) the availability of such Incremental Term Loans shall only be subject to the accuracy of customary specified
representations and those representations of the seller or the target company (as applicable) included in the acquisition or other purchase agreement related to such Permitted Acquisition or other investment permitted hereby (each a
Purchase Agreement) that are material to the interests of the Lenders and only to the extent that the Borrower or its applicable Subsidiary has the right to terminate its obligations under such Purchase Agreement as a result of a
failure of such representations to be true and correct in all material respects (or in all respects if the applicable representation and warranty is qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect) as of the date of the applicable Purchase
Agreement; and (y) and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing as of the date of the applicable Purchase Agreement; and (iii) the Administrative Agent shall have received customary documents and legal opinions consistent
with those delivered on the Effective Date as to such matters as are reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Incremental Assumption Agreement. 
(d)    Any Person providing a Term Loan Commitment or Incremental Revolving Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.20
that is not an existing Lender shall provide to the Administrative Agent, its name, address, tax identification number and/or such other information as shall be reasonably necessary for the Administrative Agent to comply with know your
customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation, the Patriot Act. 
(e)    Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may take any and all action as may be
reasonably necessary to ensure that (i) all Incremental Term Loans (other than Other Incremental Term Loans), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of the outstanding applicable Class of Term Loans on a pro rata basis, and
(ii) all Revolving Loans in respect of Incremental Revolving Commitments, when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of the applicable Class of outstanding Revolving Loans on a pro rata basis. The Borrower agrees that
Section 2.16 shall apply to any conversion of Eurodollar Loans to ABR Loans reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to effect the foregoing. 
SECTION 2.21.    Extensions of Loans and Commitments. 
(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 2.18(d) (which provisions shall not be
applicable to this Section 2.21), pursuant to one or more offers made from time to time by the Borrower to all Lenders of any Class of Term Loans and/or Revolving Commitments on a pro rata basis (based, in the case of an offer to the
Lenders under any Class of Term Loans, on the aggregate outstanding Term Loans of such Class and, in the case of an offer to the Lenders holding any Class of Revolving Commitments, on the aggregate outstanding Revolving Commitments of
such Class, as applicable), and on the same terms to each such Lender (Pro Rata Extension Offers), the Borrower is hereby permitted to consummate transactions with individual Lenders that agree to such transactions from time to
time to extend the maturity date of such Lenders Loans and/or Commitments of such Class and to otherwise modify the terms of such Lenders Loans and/or Commitments of such Class pursuant to the terms of the relevant Pro Rata
Extension Offer (including, without limitation, increasing the interest rate or fees payable in respect of such Lenders Loans and/or Commitments and/or modifying the amortization schedule in respect of such Lenders Loans and/or adding or
increasing any prepayment penalties or premiums). For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to on the same terms in the preceding sentence shall mean, (i) in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Class of Term Loans,
that all of the Term Loans of such Class are offered to be extended for the same amount of time and that the interest rate changes and fees payable with respect to such extension are the same and (ii) in the case of an offer to the Lenders
holding any Class of Revolving Commitments, that all of the Revolving Commitments of such Class are offered to be extended for the same amount of time and that the interest rate changes and

  56 



fees payable with respect to such extension are the same. Any such extension (an Extension) agreed to between the Borrower and any such Lender (an Extending
Lender) will be established under this Agreement by implementing an Other Term Loan for such Lender if such Lender is extending an existing Term Loan (such extended Term Loan, an Extended Term Loan) or an Other Revolving
Commitment for such Lender if such Lender is extending an existing Revolving Commitment (such extended Revolving Commitment, an Extended Revolving Commitment, and any Revolving Loan made pursuant to such Extended Revolving
Commitment, an Extended Revolving Loan). Each Pro Rata Extension Offer shall specify the date on which the Borrower proposes that the Extended Term Loan shall be made or the proposed Extended Revolving Commitment shall become
effective, which shall be a date not earlier than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion). 
(b)    The Borrower and each Extending Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, but without the
consent of any other Person, an amendment to this Agreement (an Extension Amendment) and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify as necessary to evidence the Extended Term Loans and/or
Extended Revolving Commitments of such Extending Lender. Each Extension Amendment shall specify the terms of the applicable Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Commitments; provided that: 
(i)    except as to interest rates, fees, prepayment penalties and premiums and any other pricing terms,
amortization, final maturity date and participation in prepayments and commitment reductions (which shall, subject to clauses (ii) and (iii) of this proviso, be determined by the Borrower and set forth in the Pro Rata Extension Offer) or terms
only applicable after the latest maturity date of any other Loans or Commitments, the Extended Term Loans shall have (x) the same terms as the existing Class of Term Loans from which they are extended or (y) such other terms as shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent;  (ii)    the final maturity date of any
Extended Term Loans shall be no earlier than the latest maturity date applicable to any other Loans or Commitments hereunder and in effect on the date of incurrence; 
(iii)    the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Extended Term Loans shall be no shorter than the
remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Class of Term Loans to which such offer relates; 
(iv)    except as to interest rates, fees, prepayment penalties and premiums and any other pricing terms
and final maturity (which shall be determined by the Borrower and set forth in the Pro Rata Extension Offer) or terms only applicable after the latest maturity date of any other Loans or Commitments, any Extended Revolving Commitment shall have
(x) the same terms as the existing Class of Revolving Commitments from which they are extended or (y) have such other terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and, in respect of any other terms that would
affect the rights or duties of any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, such terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be; and 
(v)    any Extended Term Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not a
greater than pro rata basis) than the other outstanding Term Loans in any mandatory prepayment hereunder. Upon the effectiveness of any Extension Amendment, this Agreement shall be amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect
the existence and terms of the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Commitments evidenced thereby as provided for in Section 9.02(f). 
  57 


Any such deemed amendment may be memorialized in writing by the Administrative Agent with the Borrowers
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), but without the consent of any other Person, and furnished to the other parties hereto. If provided in any Extension Amendment with respect to any Extended Revolving Commitments, and
with the consent of each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender, participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans shall be reallocated to lenders holding such Extended Revolving Commitments in the manner specified in such Extension Amendment,
including upon effectiveness of such Extended Revolving Commitment or upon or prior to the maturity date for any Class of Revolving Commitments. 
(c)    Upon the effectiveness of any such Extension, the applicable Extending Lenders Term Loan will be
automatically designated an Extended Term Loan and/or such Extending Lenders Revolving Commitment will be automatically designated an Extended Revolving Commitment. For purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (i) if such
Extending Lender is extending a Term Loan, such Extending Lender will be deemed to have an Other Term Loan having the terms of such Extended Term Loan and (ii) if such Extending Lender is extending a Revolving Commitment, such Extending Lender
will be deemed to have an Other Revolving Commitment having the terms of such Extended Revolving Commitment. 
(d)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including without
limitation this Section 2.21), (i) as a condition to any Extension, not less than 50% of the aggregate amount of outstanding Loans and Commitments of the Class being extended pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall participate in such
Extension, (ii) any Extending Lender may extend all or any portion of its Term Loans and/or Revolving Commitment pursuant to one or more Pro Rata Extension Offers (subject to applicable proration in the case of over participation) (including
the extension of any Extended Term Loan and/or Extended Revolving Commitment), (iii) as a condition to any Extension, (A) the Borrower shall be in compliance immediately prior to and immediately after giving effect (including giving effect on a
pro forma basis) to such Extension with the financial covenants set forth in Section 6.10 (without giving effect to any Acquisition Holiday) as of the last day of the fiscal quarter most recently ended for which financial statements have been
delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b) (or, if prior to the date of the delivery of the first financial statements to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b), the most recent financial statements referred to in Section 3.04), as
applicable, (B) no Event of Default shall exist and (C) the representations and warranties of the Borrower set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects (or in all respects if the applicable representation
and warranty is qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect), except to the extent that such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in
all material respects (or in all respects if the applicable representation and warranty is qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect) as of such earlier date, (iv) all Extended Term Loans, Extended Revolving Commitments and all
obligations in respect thereof shall be Obligations of the relevant Loan Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that rank equally and ratably in right of security with all other Obligations of the Class being extended (and
all other Obligations secured by Other First Liens), (v) no Issuing Bank shall be obligated to issue Letters of Credit under, and the Swingline Lender shall not be obligated to make any Swingline Loan in respect of, such Extended Revolving
Commitments unless it shall have consented thereto and (vi) there shall be no borrower (other than the Borrower) and no guarantors (other than the Loan Parties) in respect of any such Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Commitments. 
(e)    Each Extension shall be consummated pursuant to procedures set forth in the associated Pro Rata Extension Offer;
provided, that the Borrower shall reasonably cooperate with the Administrative Agent prior to making any Pro Rata Extension Offer to establish reasonable procedures with respect to mechanical provisions relating to such Extension, including,
without limitation, timing, rounding and other adjustments. 
  58 


SECTION 2.22.    Refinancing Amendments. 
(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 2.18(d) (which provisions shall
not be applicable to this Section 2.22), the Borrower may by revocable written notice to the Administrative Agent establish one or more additional tranches of term loans under this Agreement (such loans, Refinancing Term
Loans), all the proceeds of which are used to Refinance in whole or in part any Class of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(b). Each such notice shall specify the date (each, a Refinancing Effective Date) on which
the Borrower proposes that the Refinancing Term Loans shall be made, which shall be a date not earlier than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period agreed to by
the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion); provided that:  (i)    immediately before
giving effect to the borrowing of such Refinancing Term Loans on the Refinancing Effective Date, each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 shall be satisfied; 
(ii)    the final maturity date of the Refinancing Term Loans shall be no earlier than the maturity date of
the refinanced Term Loans;  (iii)    the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Refinancing Term
Loans shall be no shorter than the then-remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the refinanced Term Loans; 
(iv)    the aggregate principal amount of the Refinancing Term Loans shall not exceed the outstanding
principal amount of the refinanced Term Loans plus amounts used to pay fees, prepayment premiums or penalties, costs and expenses (including original issue discount) and accrued interest associated therewith; 
(v)    all other terms applicable to such Refinancing Term Loans (other than provisions relating to
original issue discount, upfront fees, prepayment penalties and premiums, interest rates and any other pricing terms and optional prepayment or mandatory prepayment or redemption terms, which shall be as agreed between the Borrower and the Lenders
providing such Refinancing Term Loans) taken as a whole shall (as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent) be substantially similar to, or no more restrictive to the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries than, the terms, taken as a
whole, applicable to the Term Loans being refinanced (except to the extent such covenants and other terms apply solely to any period after the latest maturity date applicable to any Loans or Commitments hereunder or are otherwise reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent);  (vi)    the Borrower shall be in compliance immediately prior
to and immediately after giving effect (including giving effect on a pro forma basis) to such refinancing with the financial covenants set forth in Section 6.10 (without giving effect to any Acquisition Holiday) as of the last day of the fiscal
quarter most recently ended for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b) (or, if prior to the date of the delivery of the first financial statements to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b), the
most recent financial statements referred to in Section 3.04), as applicable;  (vii)    there
shall be no borrower (other than the Borrower) and no guarantors (other than the Loan Parties) in respect of such Refinancing Term Loans, as determined on the Refinancing Effective Date; 
  59 


(viii)    any Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be an
unrestricted subsidiary under the terms of any Refinancing Term Loans, as determined on the Refinancing Effective Date; 
(ix)    Refinancing Term Loans shall not be secured by any asset of the Borrower or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries other than the Collateral; and  (x)    Refinancing Term Loans may participate on a pro
rata basis or on a less than pro rata basis (but not on a greater than pro rata basis) in any voluntary or mandatory prepayments (other than as provided otherwise in the case of such prepayments pursuant to Section 2.11(b)) hereunder, as specified
in the applicable Refinancing Amendment.  (b)    The Borrower may approach any Lender or any other Person that would
be a permitted assignee pursuant to Section 9.04 to provide all or a portion of the Refinancing Term Loans; provided, that any Lender offered or approached to provide all or a portion of the Refinancing Term Loans may elect or decline,
in its sole discretion, to provide a Refinancing Term Loan. Any Refinancing Term Loans made on any Refinancing Effective Date shall be designated an additional Class of Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement; provided
further that any Refinancing Term Loans may, to the extent provided in the applicable Refinancing Amendment governing such Refinancing Term Loans, be designated as an increase in any previously established Class of Term Loans made to a
Borrower.  (c)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 2.18(d) (which
provisions shall not be applicable to this Section 2.22), the Borrower may by revocable written notice to the Administrative Agent establish one or more additional credit facilities hereunder (Replacement Revolving
Facilities) providing for revolving commitments (Replacement Revolving Commitments and the revolving loans thereunder, Replacement Revolving Loans), which replace in whole or in part any Class of
Revolving Commitments under this Agreement. Each such notice shall specify the date (each, a Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date) on which the Borrower proposes that the Replacement Revolving Commitments shall become
effective, which shall be a date not less than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion);
provided that:  (i)    immediately before giving effect to the establishment of such Replacement
Revolving Commitments on the Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date, each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 shall be satisfied; 
(ii)    after giving effect to the establishment of any Replacement Revolving Commitments and any
concurrent reduction in the aggregate amount of any other Revolving Commitments, the aggregate amount of Revolving Commitments shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments outstanding immediately prior to the applicable
Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date plus amounts used to pay fees, prepayment premiums and penalties, costs and expenses (including original issue discount) and accrued interest associated therewith; 
(iii)    no Replacement Revolving Commitments shall have a final maturity date (or require commitment
reductions or amortizations) prior to the maturity date for the Revolving Commitments being replaced; 
(iv)    all other terms applicable to such Replacement Revolving Facility (other than provisions relating
to (x) fees, prepayment penalties and premiums, interest rates and other pricing terms and prepayment and commitment reduction and optional redemption terms which shall be as agreed between the Borrower and the Lenders providing such
Replacement Revolving 
  60 



Commitments and (y) the amount of any letter of credit sublimit or swingline sublimit under such Replacement Revolving Facility, which shall be as agreed between the Borrower, the Lenders
providing such Replacement Revolving Commitments, the Administrative Agent, the replacement issuing bank and the replacement swingline lender, if any, under such Replacement Revolving Commitments) taken as a whole shall (as reasonably determined by
the Administrative Agent) be substantially similar to, or no more restrictive to the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries than, those, taken as a whole, applicable to the Revolving Commitments so replaced (except to the extent such covenants and
other terms apply solely to any period after the latest maturity date applicable to any Loans or Commitments hereunder or are otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent); 
(v)    the Borrower shall be in compliance immediately prior to and immediately after giving effect
(including giving effect on a pro forma basis) to such refinancing with the financial covenants set forth in Section 6.10 (without giving effect to any Acquisition Holiday) as of the last day of the fiscal quarter most recently ended for which
financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b) (or, if prior to the date of the delivery of the first financial statements to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b), the most recent financial statements referred
to in Section 3.04), as applicable;  (vi)    there shall be no borrower (other than the Borrower)
and no guarantors (other than the Guarantors) in respect of such Replacement Revolving Facility, as determined on the Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date; 
(vii)    any Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be an unrestricted subsidiary under the terms of any
Replacement Revolving Facility, as determined on the Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date; 
(viii)    Replacement Revolving Commitments and extensions of credit thereunder shall not be secured by any
asset of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries other than the Collateral; and 
(ix)    Replacement Revolving Commitments and Replacement Revolving Loans may participate on a pro rata
basis or on a less than pro rata basis (but not on a greater than pro rata basis) in any voluntary or mandatory commitment reductions or prepayments (other than as provided otherwise in the case of such prepayments pursuant to Section 2.11(b))
hereunder, as specified in the applicable Refinancing Amendment.  In addition, the Borrower may establish Replacement Revolving Commitments to refinance
and/or replace all or any portion of a Term Loan hereunder, so long as the aggregate amount of such Replacement Revolving Commitments does not exceed the aggregate amount of Term Loans repaid at the time of establishment thereof plus amounts used to
pay fees, prepayment premiums and penalties, costs and expenses (including original issue discount) and accrued interest associated therewith (it being understood that such Replacement Revolving Commitment may be provided by the Lenders holding the
Term Loans being repaid and/or by any other Person that would be a permitted assignee under Section 9.04) so long as (i) immediately before giving effect to the establishment such Replacement Revolving Commitments on the Replacement
Revolving Facility Effective Date each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 shall be satisfied, (ii) the remaining life to termination of such Replacement Revolving Commitments shall be no shorter than the Weighted Average Life to
Maturity then applicable to the refinanced Term Loans, (iii) the final termination date of the Replacement Revolving Commitments shall be no earlier than the maturity date of the refinanced Term Loans, (iv) the Borrower shall be in
compliance immediately prior to and immediately after giving effect (including giving effect on a pro 
  61 



forma basis) to such replacement with the financial covenants set forth in Section 6.10 (without giving effect to any Acquisition Holiday) as of the last day of the fiscal quarter most
recently ended for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b) (or, if prior to the date of the delivery of the first financial statements to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b), the most recent
financial statements referred to in Section 3.04), as applicable, (v) there shall be no borrower (other than the Borrower) and no guarantors (other than the Loan Parties) in respect of such Replacement Revolving Facility, (vi) any
Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be an unrestricted subsidiary under the terms of any Replacement Revolving Facility, (vii) no Replacement Revolving Facility shall be secured by any asset of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries
other than the Collateral and (viii) all other terms applicable to such Replacement Revolving Facility (other than provisions relating to (x) fees, prepayment penalties and premiums, interest rates and other pricing terms and prepayment
and commitment reduction and optional redemption terms which shall be as agreed between the Borrower and the Lenders providing such Replacement Revolving Commitments and (y) the amount of any letter of credit sublimit or swingline sublimit
under such Replacement Revolving Facility, which shall be as agreed between the Borrower, the Lenders providing such Replacement Revolving Commitments, the Administrative Agent, the replacement issuing bank and the replacement swingline lender, if
any, under such Replacement Revolving Commitments) taken as a whole shall (as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent) be substantially similar to, or no more restrictive to the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries than, those, taken
as a whole, applicable to the Term Loans being refinanced (except to the extent such covenants and other terms apply solely to any period after the latest maturity date applicable to any Loans or Commitments hereunder or are otherwise reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent).  (d)    The Borrower may approach any Lender or any other Person that would
be a permitted assignee of a Revolving Commitment pursuant to Section 9.04 to provide all or a portion of the Replacement Revolving Commitments; provided that any Lender offered or approached to provide all or a portion of the
Replacement Revolving Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a Replacement Revolving Commitment. Any Replacement Revolving Commitment made on any Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date shall be designated an
additional Class of Revolving Commitments for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that any Replacement Revolving Commitments may, to the extent provided in the applicable Refinancing Amendment, be designated as an increase in any
previously established Class of Revolving Commitments.  (e)    The Borrower and each Lender providing the
applicable Refinancing Term Loans and/or Replacement Revolving Commitments (as applicable) shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an amendment to this Agreement (a Refinancing Amendment) and such other necessary
documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence such Refinancing Term Loans and/or Replacement Revolving Commitments (as applicable). For purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (A) if a Lender is
providing a Refinancing Term Loan, such Lender will be deemed to have an Other Term Loan having the terms of such Refinancing Term Loan and (B) if a Lender is providing a Replacement Revolving Commitment, such Lender will be deemed to have an
Other Revolving Commitment having the terms of such Replacement Revolving Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including without limitation this Section 2.22), (i) no
Refinancing Term Loan or Replacement Revolving Commitment is required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum increment, (iii) there shall be no condition to any incurrence of any Refinancing Term Loan or Replacement Revolving Commitment at
any time or from time to time other than those set forth in clauses (a) or (c) above, as applicable, and (iv) unless otherwise agreed to by the applicable Lender with respect to such Loans or Commitments, all Refinancing Term Loans,

SECTION 2.23.    Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: 
(a)    fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant
to Section 2.12(a);  (b)    the Revolving Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender
shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); provided, that, except as
otherwise provided in Section 9.02, this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby;
 (c)    if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time a Revolving Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender
then:  (i)    all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender
(other than the portion of such Swingline Exposure referred to in clause (b) of the definition of such term) shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders that are Revolving Lenders in accordance
with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that such reallocation does not, as to any such non-Defaulting Lender, cause such non-Defaulting
Lenders Revolving Credit Exposure to exceed its Revolving Commitment;  (ii)    if the
reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one (1) Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Swingline Exposure and
(y) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the applicable Issuing Banks only the Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to
clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.06(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding; 
(iii)    if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure
pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting
Lenders LC Exposure is cash collateralized;  (iv)    if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders that are Revolving Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Revolving Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and Section 2.12(b) shall be
adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages; and 
(v)    if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash
collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Revolving Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect
to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure shall be payable ratably to the applicable Issuing Banks until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and 
(d)    so long as any Revolving Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any
Swingline Loan and the Issuing Banks shall not be required to issue, 
  63 



amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied (acting in good faith) that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lenders then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered
by the Revolving Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders that are Revolving Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.23(c), and participating
interests in any such newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders that are Revolving Lenders in a manner consistent with
Section 2.23(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).  If (i) a Bankruptcy Event or a Bail-In Action with respect to a Lender Parent shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Banks have a good faith belief that
any Revolving Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Banks shall not
be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder or any obligations of such Lender(s) in question to reimburse any Swingline Loans and/or payments with respect to Letters of Credit shall have been
reallocated to non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with Section 2.23(c) hereof.  In the event
that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Banks each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC
Exposure of the Revolving Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Revolving Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the applicable Class of the other Lenders (other
than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.

same shall become delinquent or in default, except where (a) the validity or amount thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (b) the Borrower or such Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate reserves with
respect thereto in accordance with GAAP and (c) the failure to make payment pending such contest would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 
SECTION 5.05.    Maintenance of Properties; Insurance. The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, (a) keep and maintain all property material to the conduct of business of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in good working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and
(b) maintain with financially sound and reputable carriers insurance in such amounts and against such risks as is customarily maintained by companies engaged in the same or similar businesses operating in the same or similar locations. The
Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent (for distribution to the Lenders), upon request of the Administrative Agent, information in reasonable detail as to the insurance so maintained. On the
90th day to occur after the Effective Date (unless extended by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent endorsements (x) to all

fail to obtain or maintain any of the policies or insurance required herein or to pay any premium in whole or in part relating thereto, then the Administrative Agent, without waiving or releasing any obligations or resulting Default hereunder, may
at any time or times thereafter (but shall be under no obligation to do so) obtain and maintain such policies of insurance and pay such premiums and take any other action with respect thereto which the Administrative Agent deems advisable. All sums
so disbursed by the Administrative Agent shall constitute part of the Obligations, payable as provided in this Agreement. The Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders prompt written notice of any casualty or other insured

as often as reasonably requested; provided that, excluding any such visits and inspections during the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, only the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders may exercise rights of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Section 5.06 and the Administrative Agent shall not exercise such rights more often than one (1) time during any fiscal year of the Borrower. The Administrative Agent and its respective
representatives and independent contractors shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid interruption of the normal business operations of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries. The Borrower acknowledges that the Administrative Agent,

under all indentures, material agreements (including, without limitation, the BRAC Analysis Testing Agreements) and other material instruments to which it is a party, except, in each case, where the failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower will maintain in effect and enforce policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by the Borrower, its Subsidiaries and their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions.  SECTION 5.08.    Use
of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans will be used to refinance certain Indebtedness of the Borrower evidenced by the Existing Credit Agreement, for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Borrower, its Restricted Subsidiaries
and, to the extent permitted hereunder, its Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and for the payment of fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing (including funding of upfront and similar fees, commissions, transaction costs and expenses in
connection with this Agreement). No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, whether directly or indirectly, for any purpose that entails a violation of any of the Regulations of the Board, including Regulations T, U and X. The Borrower will
not request any Borrowing or Letter of Credit, and the Borrower shall not use, and shall ensure that its Subsidiaries and its or their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall not use, the proceeds of any Borrowing or Letter of
Credit (i) in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment or giving of money, or anything else of value, to any Person in violation of any Anti-Corruption Laws, (ii) for the purpose of funding,
financing or facilitating any activities, business or transaction of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in any Sanctioned Country, to the extent such activities, businesses or transaction would be prohibited by Sanctions if conducted by a corporation

becomes a Restricted Subsidiary (including pursuant to the designation of any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary) or any Restricted Subsidiary qualifies independently as, or is designated by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent
as, a Material Restricted Domestic Subsidiary pursuant to the definition of Material Restricted Domestic Subsidiary, the Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent with written notice thereof and shall cause each such Restricted
Subsidiary which also qualifies as a Material Restricted Domestic Subsidiary to deliver to the Administrative Agent a joinder to the Subsidiary Guaranty and the Security Agreement (in each case in the form contemplated thereby) pursuant to which
such Restricted Subsidiary agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, such Subsidiary Guaranty and the Security Agreement to be accompanied by appropriate corporate resolutions, other corporate documentation and legal opinions
consistent with those delivered on the Effective Date and otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no Restricted Subsidiary
constituting an Excluded Subsidiary shall be required to be a Guarantor.  (b)    Subject to the limitations contained
in this Section 5.09 and elsewhere in the Loan Documents, the Borrower will cause, and will cause each other Loan Party to cause, all of its Collateral to be subject at all times to first priority, perfected Liens in favor
of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties to secure the Secured Obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Collateral Documents, subject in any case to Liens permitted by Section 6.02. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower will cause the Applicable Pledge Percentage of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of each Pledge Subsidiary directly owned by the Borrower or any other Loan Party to be subject at all times to a
first priority, perfected Lien in favor of the Collateral Agent to secure the Secured Obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Collateral Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Loan Party shall be required to
provide any mortgage, landlord waiver, collateral access agreement, estoppel or deed of trust with respect to any real property (including leasehold interests), (ii) no Loan Party shall be required to obtain the consent of any governmental authority
or third party, (iii) no actions shall be required to perfect a security interest in letter of credit rights, other than a filing of a UCC financing statement, (iv) no deposit account or securities account, or similar, control agreements
shall be required, (v) assets will be excluded from the Collateral in circumstances where the cost of obtaining a security interest in such assets exceeds the practical benefit to the Lenders afforded thereby as reasonably determined by the
Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Borrower) and (vi) the Borrower and Subsidiary Guarantors shall not be required, nor shall the Administrative Agent be authorized, to take any action in any
non-U.S. jurisdiction in order to create any security interests in assets located or titled outside the U.S. or to perfect any security interests in such assets, including, without limitation, any intellectual
property registered in any non-U.S. jurisdiction or any equity interests of any subsidiaries organized in any non-U.S. jurisdiction (it being understood that there shall
be no security agreements or pledge agreements governed under the laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction). 
(c)    Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to the limitations in this Section 5.09 and elsewhere in the Loan
Documents, the Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to the Agents such documents, agreements and instruments, and will take or cause to be taken such further actions
(including the filing and recording of financing statements, fixture filings and other documents and such other actions or deliveries of the type required by Section 4.01, as applicable), which may be required by law or which the Agents may,
from 
  75 



time to time, reasonably request to carry out the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to ensure perfection and priority of the Liens created by the Collateral
Documents (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the disclosure of any additional assets constituting Collateral pursuant to any updates of the exhibits to the Security Agreement as required thereby), all at the expense of the
Borrower.  SECTION 5.10.    Designation of Subsidiaries. The Borrower may at any time designate any Restricted
Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that (a) immediately before and after giving effect (including giving effect on a pro forma basis) to such designation,

recent financial statements referred to in Section 3.04), as applicable, (b) immediately prior to giving effect to such designation, (i) any such Restricted Subsidiary so designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary has not contributed
greater than five percent (5%) of Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters or (ii) any such Restricted Subsidiary so designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary has not
contributed greater than five percent (5%) of Consolidated Total Assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters, (c) no Subsidiary may be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary if such

required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation, the Patriot Act, with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary. The designation of
any Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall constitute an investment by the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries therein at the date of designation in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Borrowers or applicable
Restricted Subsidiarys, as the case may be, investment therein, and such investment shall be subject to Section 6.04(t). The designation of any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary shall constitute (i) the incurrence at the
time of designation of any Indebtedness, investments, loans, advances, Guarantees or Liens of such Subsidiary existing at such time and (ii) a return on any investment by the Borrower or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary in Unrestricted
Subsidiaries pursuant to the preceding sentence in an amount equal to the fair market value at the date of such designation of the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiarys investment in such Subsidiary. 
SECTION 5.11.    Post-Closing Obligations. Within ninety (90) days after the Effective Date (or such later
date as the Administrative Agent shall agree in its sole discretion), the Borrower shall take such actions set forth on Schedule 5.11.

Indebtedness Documents and the Loan Documents; or  (vii)    amends, modifies or adds any affirmative
covenant in a manner which (i) when taken as a whole, is materially adverse to the Borrower, any Restricted Subsidiary and/or the Lenders or (ii) is more onerous than the existing applicable covenant in the Subordinated Indebtedness
Documents or the applicable covenant in this Agreement, unless, in each case, such amendment, modification or addition is intended to match an amendment, modification or addition to the Loan Documents and maintain the same cushion as is in the
existing Subordinated Indebtedness Documents and the Loan Documents.  (c)    The Borrower will not, and will not

ARTICLE VIII  The
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent  Each of the Lenders, on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates that are Secured
Parties, and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent hereunder and authorizes each of the Agents to take such actions on its behalf, including execution of the other Loan
Documents, and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agents by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. In addition, to the extent required under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States of America, each of the Lenders, on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates that are Secured Parties, and the Issuing Banks hereby grants to the Collateral Agent any required powers of attorney to execute
any Collateral Document governed by the laws of such jurisdiction on such Lenders or such Issuing Banks behalf. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders (including the Swingline Lender and
the Issuing Banks), and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and 
  89 



agreed that the use of the term agent as used herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is not
intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between independent contracting parties.  The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights
and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of
business with the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder. 
No Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (a) no Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) no Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any
discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that such Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as
shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, no Agent shall have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any
information relating to the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct as determined by a final nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by the Borrower or a Lender,
and neither shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other
document delivered hereunder or in connection with any Loan Document, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the creation, perfection or priority of Liens on the Collateral or the existence of the Collateral or (vi) the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent. 
The Agents shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Agents also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the
proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Agents may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action
taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  Each Agent may perform any and all
its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent. The Agents and any such sub-agent may perform any and all
its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of
the Agents and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facility provided for herein as well as activities as an Agent.

Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided in this paragraph, any
Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have
been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks,
appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, hereunder by a successor, such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a
successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After any Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue
in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent. 
Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that the extensions of credit made hereunder are commercial loans and letters of credit and not
investments in a business enterprise or securities. Each Lender further represents that it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary course of its business and has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent
or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement as a Lender, and to make, acquire or hold Loans hereunder. Each Lender shall,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information (which may contain material, non-public information within the meaning of the United States
securities laws concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates) as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document
furnished hereunder or thereunder and in deciding whether or to the extent to which it will continue as a Lender or assign or otherwise transfer its rights, interests and obligations hereunder. 
None of the Lenders, if any, identified in this Agreement as a Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation
Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a
fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to the relevant Lenders in their respective capacities as Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation Agents, as
applicable, as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in the preceding paragraph.  The Lenders are not partners or co-venturers, and no Lender shall be liable for the acts or omissions of, or (except as otherwise set forth herein in case of any Agent) authorized to act for, any other Lender. The Administrative Agent shall have
the exclusive right on behalf of the Lenders to enforce the payment of the principal of and interest on any Loan after the date such principal or interest has become due and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 
In its capacity, the Collateral Agent is a representative of the Secured Parties within the meaning of the term secured
party as defined in the New York Uniform Commercial Code. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent authorizes the Collateral Agent to enter into each of the Collateral Documents to which it is a party and to take all action contemplated by
such documents. Each Lender 
  91 



agrees that no Secured Party (other than the Collateral Agent) shall have the right individually to seek to realize upon the security granted by any Collateral Document, it being understood and
agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised solely by the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties upon the terms of the Collateral Documents. In the event that any Collateral is hereafter pledged by any Person as collateral
security for the Secured Obligations, the Collateral Agent is hereby authorized, and hereby granted a power of attorney, to execute and deliver on behalf of the Secured Parties any Loan Documents necessary or appropriate to grant and perfect a Lien
on such Collateral in favor of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties. The Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereby authorize the Collateral Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the
Collateral Agent upon any Collateral (i) as described in Section 9.02(d); (ii) as permitted by, but only in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Loan Document; or (iii) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by
the Required Lenders, unless such release is required to be approved by all of the Lenders hereunder. Upon request by the Collateral Agent at any time, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent will confirm in writing the Collateral Agents
authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant hereto. Upon any sale or transfer of assets constituting Collateral which is permitted pursuant to the terms of any Loan Document, or consented to in writing by the Required
Lenders or all of the Lenders, as applicable, and upon at least five (5) Business Days prior written request by the Borrower to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties herein or pursuant hereto upon the Collateral that was sold or
transferred; provided that (i) the Collateral Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in the Collateral Agents opinion, would expose any Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any
consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Secured Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of the Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary in respect of) all interests retained by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, including (without limitation) the proceeds of the sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral. Any execution and delivery by
the Collateral Agent of documents in connection with any such release shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Collateral Agent. 
The Lenders and the other Secured Parties (by virtue of their acceptance of the benefits of the Loan Documents) hereby irrevocably authorize
and instruct the Collateral Agent to, without any further consent of any Lender or any other Secured Party, enter into (or acknowledge and consent to) or amend, renew, extend, supplement, restate, replace, waive or otherwise modify any Permitted
Junior Intercreditor Agreement, any Permitted First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any other intercreditor or subordination agreement (in form reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and deemed appropriate by it) with the collateral agent
or other representative of holders of Indebtedness secured (and permitted to be secured) by a Lien on assets constituting a portion of the Collateral under (1) Section 6.02(l) (and in accordance with the relevant requirements thereof) and
(2) any other provision of Section 6.02 (it being acknowledged and agreed that the Collateral Agent shall be under no obligation to execute any Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to this clause (2), and may elect to do so, or not do so, in
its sole and absolute discretion) (any of the foregoing, an Intercreditor Agreement). The Lenders and the other Secured Parties (by virtue of their acceptance of the benefits of the Loan Documents) irrevocably agree that
(x) the Collateral Agent may rely exclusively on a certificate of a Financial Officer of the Borrower as to whether any such other Liens are permitted hereunder and as to the respective assets constituting Collateral that secure (and are
permitted to secure) such Indebtedness hereunder and (y) any Intercreditor Agreement entered into by the Collateral Agent shall be binding on the Secured Parties, and each Lender and each other Secured Party hereby agrees that it will take no
actions contrary to the provisions of, if entered into and if applicable, any Intercreditor Agreement.

In case of the pendency of any proceeding with respect to any Loan Party under any Federal, state
or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or any LC Disbursement shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by
declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: 
        (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and
interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, LC Exposure and all other Secured Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing
Banks and the Administrative Agent (including any claim under Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 
        (b) collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on
any such claims and to distribute the same;  and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any
such proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender, each Issuing Bank and each other Secured Party to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or the other Secured Parties, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due to it, in its capacity as the Administrative Agent, under the Loan Documents (including under Section 9.03). 
The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any
portion of the Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or
more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar laws in any other
applicable jurisdictions, or (b) at any other sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in
accordance with any applicable law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required
Lenders on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to
the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) for the asset or assets so purchased (or for the equity interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are issued in
connection with such purchase). In connection with any such bid (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles
(ii) each of the Secured Parties ratable interests in the Obligations which were credit bid shall be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to be assigned to such vehicle or vehicles for the purpose of closing such sale,
(iii) the Administrative shall be authorized to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or
vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by, and the governing documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Required Lenders or their permitted assignees
under the terms of this Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the case may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the
Required 
  93 



Lenders contained in Section 9.02 of this Agreement), (iv) the Administrative Agent on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue to each of the Secured
Parties, ratably on account of the relevant Obligations which were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership, limited partnership interests or membership interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and/or debt instruments issued by such
acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any
reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of Obligations credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall
automatically be reassigned to the Secured Parties pro rata and the equity interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of such Obligations shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or
any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Obligations of each Secured Party are deemed assigned to the acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured
Party shall execute such documents and provide such information regarding the Secured Party (and/or any designee of the Secured Party which will receive interests in or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Administrative Agent
may reasonably request in connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, the formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such credit bid.

procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.  Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices

function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by

to, make Communications (as defined below) available to the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders by posting the Communications on Debt Domain, Intralinks, Syndtrak, ClearPar or a substantially similar Electronic System. 
(ii)    Any Electronic System used by the Administrative Agent is provided as is and as
available. The Agent Parties (as defined below) do not warrant the adequacy of such Electronic Systems and expressly disclaim liability for errors or omissions in the Communications. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory,
including any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by any Agent Party in connection with
the Communications or any Electronic System. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) have any liability to any Loan Party, any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any
other Person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct 
  95 



or indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of any Loan Partys or the Administrative Agents

SECTION 9.02.    Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or
any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall
be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. 
(b)    Except as provided in Section 2.20, 2.21 and 2.22 and subject to clauses (c) and (f) below, neither this
Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of
the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of
interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby ((x) other than any reduction of any rate of interest accrued pursuant to Section 2.13(c) and (y) except that any
amendment or modification of the financial covenants in this Agreement (or defined terms used in the financial covenants in this Agreement) shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (ii)),
(iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled
date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby (other than any reduction of the amount of, or any extension of the payment date for, the mandatory prepayments required under
Section 2.11, in each case which shall only require the approval of the Required Lenders), (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or (d) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the
written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of Required Lenders or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify
any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (it being understood that, notwithstanding the foregoing, solely with the consent of the parties prescribed by
Section 2.20, 2.21 and 2.22, as applicable, to be parties to any respective Incremental Term Loan Amendment, Extension Amendment and/or Refinancing Amendment, Incremental Term Loans, Extended Term Loans and/or Refinancing Term Loans may be
included in the determination of Required Lenders on substantially the 
  96 



same basis as the Revolving Commitments and the Revolving Loans are included on the Effective Date), (vi) release all or substantially all of the Subsidiary Guarantors from their obligations
under the Subsidiary Guaranty, in each case, without the written consent of each Lender, or (vii) except as provided in clause (d) of this Section or in any Collateral Document, release all or substantially all of the Collateral, without
the written consent of each Lender; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of any Agent, the Issuing Banks or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written
consent of such Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be (it being understood that any change to Section 2.23 shall require the consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender);
provided further, that no such agreement shall amend or modify the provisions of Section 2.06 or any letter of credit application and any bilateral agreement between the Borrower and any Issuing Bank regarding such Issuing
Banks Letter of Credit Commitment or the respective rights and obligations between the Borrower and such Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance of Letters of Credit without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and such
Issuing Bank, respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification of this Agreement shall be required of any Defaulting Lender, except with respect to any amendment, waiver or other
modification referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first proviso of this paragraph and then only in the event such Defaulting Lender shall be directly affected by such amendment, waiver or other modification. 
(c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and any other Loan Document may be amended (or amended and restated)
with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (x) to add one or more credit facilities (in addition to the Incremental Facilities, Extensions, Replacement Revolving Loans and Refinancing Term Loans
described in this Agreement) to this Agreement and to permit extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents with the Revolving Loans and the Term Loans and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (y) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders and Lenders.
 (d)    The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent, at its option and in its sole discretion, to
release, and the Collateral Agent hereby agrees to release, any Liens granted to the Collateral Agent by the Loan Parties on any Collateral (i) upon the termination of all the Commitments, payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all Secured
Obligations (other than Unliquidated Obligations), and the cash collateralization of all Unliquidated Obligations under clause (a) of the definition thereof in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (ii) constituting property
being sold or disposed of if the Borrower certifies to the Administrative Agent that the sale or disposition is made in compliance with the terms of this Agreement (and the Administrative Agent may rely conclusively on any such certificate, without
further inquiry), (iii) constituting property leased to the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary under a lease which has expired or been terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement, or (iv) as required to effect any sale or
other disposition of such Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Article VII. Any such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any
Liens (other than those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of the Loan Parties in respect of) all interests retained by the Loan Parties, including the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the
Collateral. In addition, each of the Lenders, on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates that are Secured Parties, irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent, at its option and in its discretion, (i) to subordinate any Lien on any assets
granted to or held by the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 6.02(e) or Section 6.02(f), (ii) in the event that the Borrower shall have advised the Collateral Agent
that, notwithstanding the use by the Borrower of commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such holder (but without the requirement to pay any sums to obtain such consent) to permit the Collateral

  97 



Agent to retain its liens (on a subordinated basis as contemplated by clause (i) above), the holder of such other Indebtedness requires, as a condition to the extension of such credit, that
the Liens on such assets granted to or held by the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document be released, to release the Collateral Agents Liens on such assets or (iii) include holders of Other First Liens or (to the extent necessary or
advisable under applicable local law) Junior Liens in the benefit of the Collateral Documents in connection with the incurrence of any Other First Lien Debt or Indebtedness permitted to be secured by Junior Liens and to give effect to any
Intercreditor Agreement associated therewith.  (e)    If, in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent
requiring the consent of each Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby, the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other necessary Lenders is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is
necessary but not obtained being referred to herein as a Non-Consenting Lender), then the Borrower may elect to replace a Non-Consenting Lender as a
Lender party to this Agreement, provided that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash
the Loans and other Obligations due to the Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Non-Consenting Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of clause (b) of Section 9.04, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay or cause to be paid to such Non-Consenting Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (1) the outstanding principal amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and all interest, fees and other amounts then
accrued but unpaid to such Non-Consenting Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such
Non-Consenting Lender under Sections 2.15 and 2.17, and (2) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 2.16 had
the Loans of such Non-Consenting Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender. 
(f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein the Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the Borrower
only, amend, modify or supplement this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents (i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency, (ii) to integrate any Term Loan Commitments, Other Revolving Commitments, Term Loans
and Other Revolving Loans in a manner consistent with Sections 2.20, 2.21 and 2.22 as may be necessary to establish such Term Loan Commitments, Other Revolving Commitment, Term Loans or Other Revolving Loans as a separate Class or tranche from
the existing Term Loan Commitments (if any), revolving Commitments, Term Loans (if any) or Revolving Loans, as applicable, and, in the case of Extended Term Loans, to reduce the amortization schedule of the related existing Class of Term Loans
(if any) proportionately and (iii) to integrate any Other First Lien Debt.  (g)    Each of the parties hereto
hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may take any and all action as may be necessary to ensure that all Incremental Term Loans established pursuant to Section 2.20 will be included in an existing Class of Term Loans (if any)
outstanding on such date (an Applicable Date), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of outstanding Term Loans of such Class (the Existing Class Loans), on a pro rata basis,
and/or to ensure that, immediately after giving effect to such new Term Loans (the New Class Loans and, together with the Existing Class Loans, the Class Loans), each
Lender holding Class Loans will be deemed to hold its Pro Rata Share (as defined below) of each Class Loan on the Applicable Date (but without changing the amount of any such Lenders Term Loans), and each such Lender shall be deemed
to have effectuated such assignments as shall be required to ensure the foregoing. The Pro Rata Share of any Lender on the Applicable Date is the ratio of (1) the sum of such Lenders Existing Class Loans
immediately prior to the Applicable Date plus the amount of New Class Loans made by such Lender on the Applicable Date over (2) the aggregate principal amount of all Class Loans on the Applicable Date. 
  98 


SECTION 9.03.    Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The
Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred by the Agents and their Affiliates in connection with the syndication
and distribution (including, without limitation, via the internet or through a service such as Intralinks) of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any
amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated); provided that, for the purposes of this clause (i), the Borrower shall only be
required to pay the actual reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of one primary external counsel and, if reasonably necessary, one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for the Agents and their Affiliates, taken as a whole,
(ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Banks in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or
any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, including
the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement and any other Loan Document, including its

such conflict, one additional primary external counsel and one additional local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction to each group of similarly situated affected Persons, taken as a whole. 
(b)    The Borrower shall indemnify the Agents, and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons

the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent and, in the case of any Revolving Lender such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lenders
Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount (it being understood that the Borrowers failure to pay any such amount shall not relieve the
Borrower of any default in the payment thereof); provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against such Agent, such Issuing Bank or
the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such.  (d)    To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall

shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default described in paragraph (a), (b), (h), (i), or (j) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee;

Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $10,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of the Borrower
shall be required if any Event of Default pursuant to Section 7 subclauses (a), (b), (h), (i) or (j) has occurred and is continuing;

For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the terms Approved Fund and
Ineligible Institution have the following meanings:  Approved Fund means any Person (other than a natural
person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or
(c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.  Ineligible Institution means
(a) a natural person, (b) a Defaulting Lender or its Lender Parent, (c) the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, or (d) a company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary
benefit of, a natural person or relative(s) thereof.  (iii)    Subject to acceptance and recording
thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender
of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. 
(iv)    The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a
non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders,
and the Commitments of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of
this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
(v)    Upon its receipt of (x) a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning
Lender and an assignee or (y) to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to a Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and the parties to the Assignment and Assumption are
participants, the assignees completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such
assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register; provided that if either the assigning Lender or the
assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 
  102 



2.07(b), 2.18(e) or 9.03(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such
payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. 
(c)    Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks or the Swingline
Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities other than an Ineligible Institution (a Participant), in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged; (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations; and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations
under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.17(f)
(it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.17(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of
this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.18 and 2.19 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Sections 2.15 or 2.17, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that
occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be
subject to Section 2.18(d) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which
it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register);
provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans,
Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded
in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have
no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (d)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge
or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

  103 


SECTION 9.05.    Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations
and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the
other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and
notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the
Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof. 
SECTION 9.06.    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution. This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and
any separate letter agreements with respect to (i) fees payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arrangers and (ii) any modifications to the Letter of Credit Commitment of any Issuing Bank constitute the entire contract among the
parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective
when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy, e-mailed .pdf or
any other electronic means that reproduces an image of the actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. The words execution, signed,
signature, delivery, and words of like import in or relating to any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to include Electronic Signatures, deliveries
or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may
be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the
Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, provided that nothing herein shall require the Administrative Agent to accept electronic signatures in any form or format without its prior written consent. 
SECTION 9.07.    Severability. Any provision of any Loan Document held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof; and the invalidity of a
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.  SECTION
9.08.    Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Secured Party is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and
apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final and in whatever currency denominated) at any time held and other obligations at any 
  104 



time owing by such Secured Party to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor against any of and all of the Secured Obligations held by such Secured Party,
irrespective of whether or not such Secured Party shall have made any demand under the Loan Documents and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Secured Party under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of setoff) which such Secured Party may have.  SECTION 9.09.    Governing Law;

respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any
Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any Loan Party or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. 
(c)    Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. 
(d)    Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in

the Issuing Banks and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates directors, officers, employees and agents, including
accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and who are subject to customary confidentiality obligations of
professional practice or who agree to be bound by the terms of this paragraph (or language substantially similar to this paragraph) (with such Credit Party being, to the extent within its control, responsible for such Persons compliance with

Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (1) any assignee of or Participant in, or any
prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (2) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations,
(g) on a confidential basis to (1) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the credit facility provided for herein or (2) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the
issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers with respect to the credit facility provided for herein, (h) with the prior written consent of the Borrower or (i) to the extent such Information (1) becomes publicly available other than as a
result of a breach of this Section or (2) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower and the Subsidiaries. For the purposes of this
Section, Information means all information received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower, the Subsidiaries or its or their business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or
any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary and other than information pertaining to this Agreement routinely provided by arrangers to data service providers, including league table providers, that
serve the lending industry. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to
maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.  EACH LENDER
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT INFORMATION AS DEFINED IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PARAGRAPH FURNISHED TO IT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY INCLUDE MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION CONCERNING THE BORROWER AND ITS RELATED
PARTIES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE SECURITIES, AND CONFIRMS THAT IT HAS DEVELOPED COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES REGARDING THE USE OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION AND THAT IT WILL HANDLE SUCH MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE PROCEDURES AND APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

THE COURSE OF ADMINISTERING, THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE SYNDICATE-LEVEL INFORMATION, WHICH MAY CONTAIN MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE BORROWER, THE OTHER LOAN PARTIES AND THEIR RELATED PARTIES OR THEIR
RESPECTIVE SECURITIES. ACCORDINGLY, EACH LENDER REPRESENTS TO THE BORROWER AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT THAT

IT HAS IDENTIFIED IN ITS ADMINISTRATIVE QUESTIONNAIRE A CREDIT CONTACT WHO MAY RECEIVE INFORMATION THAT MAY CONTAIN MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION IN
ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES AND APPLICABLE LAW.  SECTION 9.13.    USA PATRIOT Act. Each
Lender that is subject to the requirements of the Patriot Act hereby notifies each Loan Party that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies such Loan Party, which
information includes the name and address of such Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender to identify such Loan Party in accordance with the Patriot Act. 
SECTION 9.14.    Appointment for Perfection. Each Lender hereby appoints each other Lender as its agent for the
purpose of perfecting Liens, for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties, in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of the UCC or any other applicable law can be perfected only by possession or control. Should any Lender
(other than the Collateral Agent) obtain possession or control of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify the Collateral Agent thereof, and, promptly upon the Collateral Agents request therefor shall deliver such Collateral to the
Collateral Agent or otherwise deal with such Collateral in accordance with the Collateral Agents instructions.  SECTION
9.15.    Releases of Subsidiary Guarantors.  (a)    A Subsidiary Guarantor shall
automatically be released from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty upon the consummation of any transaction permitted by this Agreement as a result of which such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided
that, if so required by this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall have consented to such transaction and the terms of such consent shall not have provided otherwise. In connection with any termination or release pursuant to this Section, the
applicable Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender to) execute and deliver to any Loan Party, at such Loan Partys expense, all documents that such Loan Party shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or
release. Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section shall be without recourse to or warranty by any Agent. 
(b)    Further, the Administrative Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender to), upon the request
of the Borrower, release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty if such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Material Restricted Domestic Subsidiary; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
else contained in the Loan Documents, if any Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Material Restricted Domestic Subsidiary, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall automatically cease to be a Subsidiary Guarantor. 
(c)    At such time as the principal and interest on the Loans, all LC Disbursements, the fees, expenses and other amounts
payable under the Loan Documents and the other Secured Obligations (other than Banking Services Obligations, Swap Obligations, and Unliquidated Obligations) shall have been paid in full in cash, the Commitments shall have been terminated and no
Letters of Credit shall be outstanding, the Subsidiary Guaranty and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive such termination) of each Subsidiary Guarantor thereunder shall automatically terminate, all without delivery of any
instrument or performance of any act by any Person.  SECTION 9.16.    Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the
Charges), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate

  107 



of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and
Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be
increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender. 
SECTION 9.17.    No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all aspects of each transaction
contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement
provided by the Lenders are arms-length commercial transactions between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Lenders and their Affiliates, on the other hand, (B) the Borrower
has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) each of the Lenders and their Affiliates is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and
will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) no Lender or any of its Affiliates has any obligation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby except, in the case of a Lender, those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) each of the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of
transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and no Lender or any of its Affiliates has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or its Affiliates. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, the Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against each of the Lenders and their Affiliates with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any
transaction contemplated hereby.  SECTION 9.18.    Acknowledgment and Consent to
Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto
acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be
bound by:  (a)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such
liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and 
(b)    the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if
applicable:  (i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; 
(ii)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership
in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to
any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or 
  108 


(iii)    the variation of the terms of such liability in
connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.  ARTICLE X 
Borrower Guarantee  In
order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder and for other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged), the Borrower hereby absolutely and irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Specified Ancillary Obligations of the Restricted Subsidiaries. The Borrower further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Specified Ancillary
Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Specified Ancillary
Obligation.  The Borrower waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Restricted Subsidiary of any of the Specified
Ancillary Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of the Borrower hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any applicable Lender (or any of its
Affiliates) to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Restricted Subsidiary under the provisions of any Banking Services Agreement, any Swap Agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the
Specified Ancillary Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any Banking Services Agreement, any Swap Agreement or other
agreement; (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations; (e) the failure of any applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates) to take any steps to perfect and
maintain any security interest in, or to preserve any rights to, any security or collateral for the Specified Ancillary Obligations, if any; (f) any change in the corporate, partnership or other existence, structure or ownership of any
Restricted Subsidiary or any other guarantor of any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations; (g) the enforceability or validity of the Specified Ancillary Obligations or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or validity of any
agreement relating thereto or with respect to any collateral securing the Specified Ancillary Obligations or any part thereof, or any other invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any Restricted Subsidiary or any other guarantor of any
of the Specified Ancillary Obligations, for any reason related to this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any Banking Services Agreement, any Swap Agreement, or any provision of applicable law, decree, order or regulation of any jurisdiction
purporting to prohibit the payment by such Restricted Subsidiary or any other guarantor of the Specified Ancillary Obligations, of any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations or otherwise affecting any term of any of the Specified Ancillary
Obligations; or (h) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Borrower or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which
would impair or eliminate any right of the Borrower to subrogation.  The Borrower further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes
a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and
waives any right to require that any resort be had by any applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates) to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in favor of any
Restricted Subsidiary or any other Person. 
  109 


The obligations of the Borrower hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation,
impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of
any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations or otherwise. 
The Borrower further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall constitute a continuing and irrevocable guarantee of all Specified Ancillary
Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Specified Ancillary Obligation (including a payment effected through exercise of a
right of setoff) is rescinded, or is or must otherwise be restored or returned by any applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates) upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise (including pursuant to any
settlement entered into by a holder of Specified Ancillary Obligations in its discretion).  In furtherance of the foregoing and not in
limitation of any other right which any applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates) may have at law or in equity against the Borrower by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Restricted Subsidiary to pay any Specified Ancillary Obligation when and
as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Borrower hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by any applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates), forthwith pay,
or cause to be paid, to such applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates) in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Specified Ancillary Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Borrower
further agrees that if payment in respect of any Specified Ancillary Obligation shall be due in a currency other than Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York or Chicago and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency
or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Specified Ancillary Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of any applicable Lender (or any of
its Affiliates), disadvantageous to such applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates) in any material respect, then, at the election of such applicable Lender, the Borrower shall make payment of such Specified Ancillary Obligation in Dollars and/or
in New York or Chicago and, as a separate and independent obligation, shall indemnify such applicable Lender (and any of its Affiliates) against any losses or reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment. 
Upon payment by the Borrower of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Borrower against any Restricted Subsidiary arising as a result
thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Specified Ancillary Obligations owed by such Restricted Subsidiary
to the applicable Lender (or its applicable Affiliates).  Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of the Borrower hereunder
except the full performance and payment in cash of the Secured Obligations (other than Unliquidated Obligations).  The Borrower hereby
absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each Subsidiary Guarantor to honor all of its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty in respect of Specified Swap
Obligations (provided, however, that the Borrower shall only be liable under this paragraph for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this paragraph or otherwise

  110 



under this Article X voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The Borrower intends that this paragraph
constitute, and this paragraph shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of each Subsidiary Guarantor for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
