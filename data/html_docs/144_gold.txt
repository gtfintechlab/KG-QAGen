(C)In the event that any change in market conditions or any law, regulation, treaty, or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation of application thereof, shall at any time after the date hereof, in the reasonable opinion of any Lender, make it unlawful or impractical for such Lender to fund or maintain Loans bearing interest based upon the LIBOR Rate or to continue such funding or maintaining, or to determine or charge interest rates at the LIBOR Rate, such Lender shall give notice of such changed circumstances to Agent and Borrowers and Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and (I) in the case of any outstanding Loans of such Lender bearing interest based upon the LIBOR Rate, the date specified in such Lender’s notice shall be deemed to be the last day of the Interest Period of such Loans, and interest upon such Lender’s Loans thereafter shall accrue interest at Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, and (II)  such Loans shall continue to accrue interest at Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin until such Lender determines that it would no longer be unlawful or impractical to maintain such Loans at the LIBOR Rate.

In the event Agent and all Lenders do not consent to the activation of a requested Additional Tranche within forty-five (45) days after receiving a written request from Borrower Representative, then the Revolving Loan Commitment shall not be increased and, within the next forty-five (45) days, Borrowers may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Agent and, if the Borrowing Base on the date of such request would have supported such increased Revolving Loan Commitment, upon repayment in full of all Obligations, no fee shall be due pursuant to Section 2.2(g) in connection with such termination.

Section 2.4Reserved.
Section 2.5Reserved.
Section 2.6General Provisions Regarding Payment; Loan Account.
(a)All payments to be made by each Borrower under any Financing Document, including payments of principal and interest made hereunder and pursuant to any other Financing Document, and all fees, expenses, indemnities and reimbursements, shall be made without set-off, recoupment or counterclaim.  If any payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension (it being understood and agreed that, solely for purposes of calculating financial covenants and computations contained herein and determining compliance therewith, if payment is made, in full, on any such extended due date, such payment shall be deemed to have been paid on the original due date without giving effect to any extension thereto).  Any payments received in the Payment Account before 12:00 Noon (Eastern time) on any date shall be deemed received by Agent on such date, and any payments received in the Payment Account at or after 12:00 Noon (Eastern time) on any date shall be deemed received by Agent on the next succeeding Business Day.  
(b)Agent shall maintain a loan account (the “Loan Account”) on its books to record Loans and other extensions of credit made by the Lenders hereunder or under any other Financing Document, and all payments thereon made by each Borrower.  All entries in the Loan Account shall be made in accordance with Agent’s customary accounting practices as in effect from time to time.  The balance in the Loan Account, as recorded in Agent’s books and records at any time shall be conclusive and binding evidence of the amounts due and owing to Agent by each Borrower absent manifest error; provided, however, that any failure to so record or any error in so recording shall not limit or otherwise affect any Borrower’s duty to pay all amounts owing hereunder or under any other Financing Document.  Agent shall endeavor to provide Borrowers with a monthly statement regarding the Loan Account (but neither Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability if Agent shall fail to provide any such statement).  Unless any Borrower notifies Agent of any objection to any such statement (specifically describing the basis for such objection) within ninety (90) days after the date of receipt thereof, it shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive upon Borrowers in all respects as to all matters reflected therein.
Section 2.7Maximum Interest.  In no event shall the interest charged with respect to the Loans or any other Obligations of any Borrower under any Financing Document exceed the maximum amount permitted under the laws of the State of New York or of any other applicable jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or elsewhere, if at any time the rate of interest payable 
47 

 
hereunder or under any Note or other Financing Document (the “Stated Rate”) would exceed the highest rate of interest permitted under any applicable law to be charged (the “Maximum Lawful Rate”), then for so long as the Maximum Lawful Rate would be so exceeded, the rate of interest payable shall be equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate; provided, however, that if at any time thereafter the Stated Rate is less than the Maximum Lawful Rate, each Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by law, continue to pay interest at the Maximum Lawful Rate until such time as the total interest received is equal to the total interest which would have been received had the Stated Rate been (but for the operation of this provision) the interest rate payable.  Thereafter, the interest rate payable shall be the Stated Rate unless and until the Stated Rate again would exceed the Maximum Lawful Rate, in which event this provision shall again apply.  In no event shall the total interest received by any Lender exceed the amount which it could lawfully have received had the interest been calculated for the full term hereof at the Maximum Lawful Rate. If, notwithstanding the prior sentence, any Lender has received interest hereunder in excess of the Maximum Lawful Rate, such excess amount shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Loans or to other amounts (other than interest) payable hereunder, and if no such principal or other amounts are then outstanding, such excess or part thereof remaining shall be paid to Borrowers.  In computing interest payable with reference to the Maximum Lawful Rate applicable to any Lender, such interest shall be calculated at a daily rate equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate divided by the number of days in the year in which such calculation is made.
Section 2.8Taxes; Capital Adequacy.  
(a)All payments of principal and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any present or future Taxes, except as required by applicable Law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and if any such withholding or deduction is in respect of any Indemnified Taxes, then the Borrowers shall pay such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by Agent and each Lender will equal the full amount Agent and such Lender would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required (including, without limitation, such withholdings and deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.8).  After payment of any Tax by a Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.8, such Borrower shall promptly forward to Agent the original or a certified copy of an official receipt, a copy of the return reporting such payment, or other documentation satisfactory to Agent evidencing such payment to such authority. Borrowers shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
(b)The Borrowers shall indemnify Agent and Lenders, within ten (10) days after demand thereof, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.8) payable or paid by Agent or any Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to Agent or any Lender and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate in reasonable detail as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrowers by a Lender (with a copy to Agent), or by Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(c)Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments made under any Financing Document shall deliver to Borrower 
48 

 
Representative and Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Borrowers or Agent as will enable Borrowers or Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.8(c)(i), 2.8(c)(ii) and 2.8(e) below) shall not be required if in such Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.   
(i)Each Lender that is not a “United States person” (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is a party hereto on the Closing Date or purports to become an assignee of an interest pursuant to Section 11.17(a) after the Closing Date (unless such Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment) (each such Lender a “Foreign Lender”) shall, to the extent permitted by Law, execute and deliver to Borrower Representative and Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower Representative or Agent) whichever of the following is applicable:  (A) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Financing Document, two (2) properly completed and executed originals of United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Financing Documents, two (2) properly completed and executed originals of IRS Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (B) two (2) executed originals of Form W-8ECI (or successor form); (C) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of any Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) two (2) executed originals of IRS Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form); (D) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, two (2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, IRS Form W-9 (or successor form), and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; or (E) other applicable forms, certificates or documents prescribed by the IRS.  Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower Representative and Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.  In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, such forms shall be delivered by each Foreign Lender upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form 
49 

 
previously delivered by such Foreign Lender.  Each Foreign Lender shall promptly notify Borrower Representative at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to Borrower Representative (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose).   
(ii)Each Lender that is a “United States person” (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is a party hereto on the Closing Date or purports to become an assignee of an interest pursuant to Section 11.17(a) after the Closing Date (unless such Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment) shall, to the extent permitted by Law, provide to Borrower Representative and Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower Representative or Agent), a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 or any successor form certifying as to such Lender’s entitlement to an exemption from U.S. backup withholding and other applicable forms, certificates or documents prescribed by the IRS or reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Agent.  Each such Lender shall promptly notify Borrowers at any time it determines that any certificate previously delivered to Borrower Representative (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. governmental authorities for such purposes) is no longer valid.   
(iii)Any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower Representative and Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower Representative or Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit Borrowers or Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
(d)If any Lender determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund in respect of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.8 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.8), then it shall promptly pay an amount equal to such refund to Borrowers, net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or of Agent with respect thereto, including any Taxes; provided, however, that Borrowers, upon the written request of such Lender or Agent, agree to repay any amount paid over to Borrowers to such Lender or to Agent (plus any related penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such Lender or Agent is required, for any reason, to disgorge or otherwise repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.8, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.8(d) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This Section 2.8 shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
(e)If a payment made to a Lender under any Financing Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower Representative and Agent at the time 
50 

 
or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Agent as may be necessary for Borrowers and Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (e), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(f)Each Lender shall severally indemnify Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.17 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by Agent in connection with any Financing Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Financing Document or otherwise payable by Agent to such Lender from any other source against any amount due to Agent under this paragraph (f).
(g)Each party’s obligations under Section 2.8(a) through (f) shall survive the resignation or replacement of Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations hereunder.
(h)If any Lender shall reasonably determine that the adoption or taking effect of, or any change in, any applicable Law regarding capital adequacy, in each instance, after the Closing Date, or any change after the Closing Date in the interpretation, administration or application thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation, administration or application thereof, or the compliance by any Lender or any Person controlling such Lender with any request, guideline or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of Law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency adopted or otherwise taking effect after the Closing Date, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such controlling Person’s capital as a consequence of such Lender’s obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such controlling Person could have achieved but for such adoption, taking effect, change, interpretation, administration, application or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such controlling Person’s policies with respect to capital adequacy) then from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth the basis for such demand and a calculation of the amount thereof in reasonable detail, a copy of which shall be furnished to Agent), Borrowers shall promptly pay to such Lender such additional amount as will compensate such Lender or such controlling Person for such reduction, so long as such amounts have accrued on or after the day which is two hundred seventy (270) days prior to the date on which such Lender first made demand therefor; provided that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a “change in applicable Law”, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.
51 

 
(i)If any Lender requests compensation under either Section 2.1(b)(iv) or Section 2.8(h), or requires Borrowers to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.8, then, upon the written request of Borrower Representative, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder (subject to the provisions of Section 11.17) to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or materially reduce amounts payable pursuant to any such Section, as the case may be, in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender (as determined in its sole good faith discretion).  Without limitation of the provisions of Section 12.14, each Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Section 2.9Appointment of Borrower Representative.

(e)No resignation by or termination of the appointment of Borrower Representative as agent and attorney-in-fact as aforesaid shall be effective, except after ten (10) Business Days’ prior written notice to Agent.  If the Borrower Representative resigns under this Agreement, Borrowers shall be entitled to appoint a successor Borrower Representative (which shall be a Borrower and shall be reasonably acceptable to Agent as such successor).  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor Borrower Representative hereunder, such successor Borrower Representative shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Borrower Representative and the term “Borrower Representative” means such successor Borrower Representative for all purposes of this Agreement and the other 
52 

 
Financing Documents, and the retiring or terminated Borrower Representative’s appointment, powers and duties as Borrower Representative shall be thereupon terminated.
Section 2.10Joint and Several Liability; Rights of Contribution; Subordination and Subrogation.
(a)Borrowers are defined collectively to include all Persons named as one of the Borrowers herein; provided, however, that any references herein to “any Borrower”, “each Borrower” or similar references, shall be construed as a reference to each individual Person named as one of the Borrowers herein.  Each Person so named shall be jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of Borrowers under this Agreement.  Each Borrower, individually, expressly understands, agrees and acknowledges, that the credit facilities would not be made available on the terms herein in the absence of the collective credit of all of the Persons named as the Borrowers herein, the joint and several liability of all such Persons, and the cross-collateralization of the collateral of all such Persons.  Accordingly, each Borrower individually acknowledges that the benefit to each of the Persons named as one of the Borrowers as a whole constitutes reasonably equivalent value, regardless of the amount of the credit facilities actually borrowed by, advanced to, or the amount of collateral provided by, any individual Borrower.  In addition, each entity named as one of the Borrowers herein hereby acknowledges and agrees that all of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, conditions, agreements and other terms contained in this Agreement shall be applicable to and shall be binding upon and measured and enforceable individually against each Person named as one of the Borrowers herein as well as all such Persons when taken together.  By way of illustration, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the terms of Section 10.1 of this Agreement are to be applied to each individual Person named as one of the Borrowers herein (as well as to all such Persons taken as a whole), such that the occurrence of any of the events described in Section 10.1 of this Agreement as to any Person named as one of the Borrowers herein shall constitute an Event of Default even if such event has not occurred as to any other Persons named as the Borrowers or as to all such Persons taken as a whole.
(b)Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, it is intended that the joint and several nature of the liability of each Borrower for the Obligations and the Liens granted by Borrowers to secure the Obligations, not constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance (as defined below).  Consequently, Agent, Lenders and each Borrower agree that if the liability of a Borrower for the Obligations, or any Liens granted by such Borrower securing the Obligations would, but for the application of this sentence, constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance, the liability of such Borrower and the Liens securing such liability shall be valid and enforceable only to the maximum extent that would not cause such liability or such Lien to constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance, and the liability of such Borrower and this Agreement shall automatically be deemed to have been amended accordingly.  For purposes hereof, the term “Fraudulent Conveyance” means a fraudulent conveyance under Section 548 of Chapter 11 of Title II of the Bankruptcy Code or a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under the applicable provisions of any fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or similar law of any state, nation or other governmental unit, as in effect from time to time.
(c)Agent is hereby authorized, without notice or demand (except as otherwise specifically required under this Agreement) and without affecting the liability of any Borrower hereunder, at any time and from time to time, to (i) renew, extend or otherwise increase the time for payment of the Obligations; (ii) with the written agreement of any Borrower, change the terms relating to the Obligations or otherwise modify, amend or change the terms of any Note or other agreement, document or instrument now or hereafter executed by any Borrower and delivered to Agent for any Lender; (iii) accept partial payments of the Obligations; (iv) take and hold any Collateral for the payment of the Obligations or for the payment of any guaranties of the Obligations and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such Collateral; (v) apply any such Collateral and direct the order or manner of sale 
53 

 
thereof as Agent, in its sole discretion, may determine; and (vi) settle, release, compromise, collect or otherwise liquidate the Obligations and any Collateral therefor in any manner, all guarantor and surety defenses being hereby waived by each Borrower.  Except as specifically provided in this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents, Agent shall have the exclusive right to determine the time and manner of application of any payments or credits, whether received from any Borrower or any other source, and such determination shall be binding on all Borrowers.  All such payments and credits may be applied, reversed and reapplied, in whole or in part, to any of the Obligations that Agent shall determine, in its sole discretion, without affecting the validity or enforceability of the Obligations of any other Borrower.
(d)Each Borrower hereby agrees that, except as hereinafter provided, its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of (i) the absence of any attempt to collect the Obligations from any obligor or other action to enforce the same; (ii) the waiver or consent by Agent with respect to any provision of any instrument evidencing the Obligations, or any part thereof, or any other agreement heretofore, now or hereafter executed by a Borrower and delivered to Agent; (iii) failure by Agent to take any steps to perfect and maintain its security interest in, or to preserve its rights to, any security or collateral for the Obligations; (iv) the institution of any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar proceeding, by or against a Borrower or Agent’s election in any such proceeding of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (v) any borrowing or grant of a security interest by a Borrower as debtor-in-possession, under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code; (vi) the disallowance, under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, of all or any portion of Agent’s claim(s) for repayment of any of the Obligations; or (vii) any other circumstance other than payment in full of the Obligations which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor or surety.
(e)Borrowers hereby agree, as between themselves, that to the extent that Agent, on behalf of Lenders, shall have received from any Borrower any Recovery Amount (as defined below), then the paying Borrower shall have a right of contribution against each other Borrower in an amount equal to such other Borrower’s contributive share of such Recovery Amount; provided, however, that in the event any Borrower suffers a Deficiency Amount (as defined below), then the Borrower suffering the Deficiency Amount shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against the other Borrowers in an amount equal to the Deficiency Amount; and provided, further, that in no event shall the aggregate amounts so reimbursed by reason of the contribution of any Borrower equal or exceed an amount that would, if paid, constitute or result in Fraudulent Conveyance.  Until all Obligations have been paid and satisfied in full, no payment made by or for the account of a Borrower including, without limitation, (i) a payment made by such Borrower on behalf of the liabilities of any other Borrower, or (ii) a payment made by any other Guarantor under any Guarantee, shall entitle such Borrower, by subrogation or otherwise, to any payment from such other Borrower or from or out of such other Borrower’s property.  The right of each Borrower to receive any contribution under this Section 2.10(e) or by subrogation or otherwise from any other Borrower shall be subordinate in right of payment to the Obligations and such Borrower shall not exercise any right or remedy against such other Borrower or any property of such other Borrower by reason of any performance of such Borrower of its joint and several obligations hereunder, until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and satisfied in full, and no Borrower shall exercise any right or remedy with respect to this Section 2.10(e) until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and satisfied in full.  As used in this Section 2.10(e), the term “Recovery Amount” means the amount of proceeds received by or credited to Agent from the exercise of any remedy of the Lenders under this Agreement or the other Financing Documents, including, without limitation, the sale of any Collateral.  As used in this Section 2.10(e), the term “Deficiency Amount” means any amount that is less than the entire amount a Borrower is entitled to receive by way of contribution or subrogation from, but that has not been paid by, the other Borrowers in respect of any Recovery Amount attributable to the Borrower entitled to contribution, until the Deficiency Amount has 
54 

 
been reduced to Zero Dollars ($0) through contributions and reimbursements made under the terms of this Section 2.10(e) or otherwise.
Section 2.11Collections and Lockbox Account. 
(a)Borrowers shall maintain a lockbox (the “Lockbox”) with Bank of America, N.A. or any other United States depository institution reasonably acceptable to Agent (the “Lockbox Bank”), subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and, subject to Section 7.4, shall execute with the Lockbox Bank a Deposit Account Control Agreement and such other agreements related to such Lockbox as Agent may reasonably require.  Borrowers shall direct Account Debtors to make payments on all Accounts directly from Account Debtors (i) into the Lockbox for deposit into the Lockbox Account and/or (ii) directly into the Lockbox Account; provided, however, that unless Agent shall otherwise direct by written notice to Borrowers, Borrowers shall be permitted to cause Account Debtors who are individuals to pay Accounts directly to Borrowers, which Borrowers shall then administer and apply in the manner required below. At all times following the Lockbox Post-Closing Period, all funds deposited into a Lockbox Account shall be transferred into the Payment Account (or, prior to the time of the initial borrowing of the Revolving Loans, such Deposit Account of Borrower, as Agent may direct in its sole discretion) by the close of each Business Day.  
(b)[Reserved]  
(c)Notwithstanding anything in any lockbox agreement or Deposit Account Control Agreement to the contrary, Borrowers agree that they shall be liable for any fees and charges in effect from time to time and charged by the Lockbox Bank in connection with the Lockbox, the Lockbox Account, and that Agent shall have no liability therefor.  Borrowers hereby indemnify and agree to hold Agent harmless from any and all liabilities, claims, losses and demands whatsoever, including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees and expenses, arising from or relating to actions of Agent or the Lockbox Bank pursuant to this Section or any lockbox agreement or Deposit Account Control Agreement or similar agreement, except to the extent of such losses arising solely from Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
(d)Agent shall apply, on a daily basis, all funds transferred into the Payment Account pursuant to this Section 2.11 to reduce the outstanding Revolving Loans in such order of application as Agent shall elect.  If as the result of collections of Accounts pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Section, a credit balance exists with respect to the Loan Account, such credit balance shall not accrue interest in favor of Borrowers, but Agent shall transfer such funds into an account designated by Borrower Representative for so long as no Event of Default exists.
(e)To the extent that any collections of Accounts or proceeds of other Collateral are not sent directly to the Lockbox or Lockbox Account but are received by any Borrower, such collections shall be held in trust for the benefit of Agent pursuant to an express trust created hereby and immediately remitted, in the form received, to applicable Lockbox or Lockbox Account.  No such funds received by any Borrower shall be commingled with other funds of the Borrowers.  
(f)Borrowers acknowledge and agree that compliance with the terms of this Section is essential, and that Agent and Lenders will suffer immediate and irreparable injury and have no adequate remedy at law, if any Borrower, through acts or omissions, causes or permits Account Debtors to send payments other than to the Lockbox or Lockbox Accounts or if any Borrower fails to promptly deposit collections of Accounts or proceeds of other Collateral in the Lockbox Account as herein required.  Accordingly, in addition to all other rights and remedies of Agent and Lenders hereunder, 
55 

 
Agent shall have the right to seek specific performance of the Borrowers’ obligations under this Section, and any other equitable relief as Agent may deem necessary or appropriate, and Borrowers waive any requirement for the posting of a bond in connection with such equitable relief.
(g)Borrowers shall not, and Borrowers shall not suffer or permit any Credit Party to, (i) withdraw any amounts from any Lockbox Account, (ii) change the procedures or sweep instructions under the agreements governing any Lockbox Accounts, or (iii) send to or deposit in any Lockbox Account any funds other than payments made with respect to and proceeds of Accounts or other Collateral.  Borrowers shall, and shall cause each Credit Party to, cooperate with Agent in the identification and reconciliation on a daily basis of all amounts received in or required to be deposited into the Lockbox Accounts.  If more than twenty percent (20%) of the collections of Accounts received by Borrowers during any given fifteen (15) day period is not identified or reconciled to the reasonable satisfaction of Agent within ten (10) Business Days of receipt, Agent shall not be obligated to make further advances of Revolving Loans under this Agreement until such amount is identified or is reconciled to the reasonable satisfaction of Agent, as the case may be.  In addition, if any such amount cannot be identified or reconciled to the reasonable satisfaction of Agent, Agent may utilize its own staff or, if it deems necessary in its Permitted Discretion, engage an outside auditor, in either case at Borrowers’ expense (which in the case of Agent’s own staff shall be in accordance with Agent’s then prevailing customary charges (plus expenses)), to make such examination and report as may be necessary to identify and reconcile such amounts required to be deposited in the Lockbox Account.
(h)If any Borrower breaches its obligation to direct payments of the proceeds of the Collateral to the Lockbox Account, Agent, as the irrevocably made, constituted and appointed true and lawful attorney for Borrowers, may, by the signature or other act of any of Agent’s authorized representatives (without requiring any of them to do so), direct any Account Debtor to pay proceeds of the Collateral to Borrowers by directing payment to the Lockbox Account.
Section 2.12Termination; Restriction on Termination.
(a)Termination by Lenders.  In addition to the rights set forth in Section 10.2, Agent may, and at the direction of Required Lenders shall, terminate this Agreement without notice upon or after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default.
(b)Termination by Borrowers.  Upon at least ten (10) Business Days’ prior written notice and pursuant to customary payoff documentation, Borrowers may, at its option, terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that no such termination shall be effective until Borrowers have paid all the Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no claim has been made) in cash in full in accordance with Section 2.12(c).   Any notice of termination given by Borrowers shall be irrevocable unless all Lenders otherwise agree in writing and no Lender shall have any obligation to make any Loans on or after the termination date stated in such notice; provided that a notice of termination of the Loans delivered by the Borrowers may state that such notice is conditioned upon the consummation of an acquisition or sale transaction or upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of other Debt or any other specified event, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrowers (by notice to the Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Borrowers may elect to terminate this Agreement in its entirety only.  No section of this Agreement or type of Loan available hereunder may be terminated singly. 
(c)Effectiveness of Termination.  All of the Obligations shall be immediately due and payable upon the Termination Date.  All undertakings, agreements, covenants, warranties and representations of Borrowers contained in the Financing Documents shall survive any such termination and Agent shall retain its Liens in the Collateral and Agent and each Lender shall retain all of its rights 
56 

 
and remedies under the Financing Documents notwithstanding such termination until all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no claim has been made) have been discharged or paid, in full, in immediately available funds, including, without limitation, all Obligations under Section 2.2 and the terms of any Fee Letter resulting from such termination.

ure to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (b) their respective rights, privileges and franchises necessary or desirable in the normal conduct of business, except where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Section 4.4Maintenance of Property; Insurance.
(a)Each Borrower will keep, and will cause each Subsidiary to keep, in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment, all material property useful and necessary in its business in good working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted.  If all or any material part of the Collateral useful or necessary in its business, or upon which any Borrowing Base is calculated, becomes damaged or destroyed, each Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to, promptly and completely repair and/or restore the affected Collateral in a good and workmanlike manner. 
65 

 
(b)Upon completion of any Permitted Contest, Borrowers shall, and will cause each Subsidiary to, promptly pay the amount due, if any, and deliver to Agent proof of the completion of the contest and payment of the amount due, if any.
(c)The Credit Parties will maintain, and will cause each of their Subsidiaries to maintain insurance policies and coverage with respect to all their property and assets to such extent and covering such risks as is customary for companies in sound financial condition in the same or similar businesses and operations and in the same or similar locations (after giving effect to any self-insurance compatible with such standards). All such insurance policies will be provided by insurance companies that the Borrower believes (in the Borrower’s reasonable business judgment) are financially sound and reputable at the time the relevant coverage is placed or renewed. 
(d)On or prior to the Closing Date, and at all times thereafter, each Borrower will cause Agent to be named as an additional insured, assignee and lender loss payee (which shall include, as applicable, identification as mortgagee), as applicable, on each insurance policy required to be maintained pursuant to this Section 4.4 pursuant to endorsements in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Agent.  Borrowers shall deliver to Agent and the Lenders (i) on the Closing Date, a certificate from Borrowers’ insurance broker dated such date showing the amount of coverage as of such date, and that such policies will include effective waivers (whether under the terms of any such policy or otherwise) by the insurer of all claims for insurance premiums against all loss payees and additional insureds and all rights of subrogation against all loss payees and additional insureds, and that if all or any part of such policy is canceled, terminated or expires, the insurer will forthwith give notice thereof to each additional insured, assignee and loss payee and that no cancellation, reduction in amount or material change in coverage thereof shall be effective until at least thirty (30) days after receipt by each additional insured, assignee and loss payee of written notice thereof, (ii) on an annual basis, and upon the request of any Lender through Agent from time to time full information as to the insurance carried, (iii) within five (5) days of receipt of notice from any insurer, a copy of any notice of cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in coverage from that existing on the date of this Agreement, (iv) forthwith, notice of any cancellation or nonrenewal of coverage by any Borrower, and (v) at least ten (10) days prior to expiration of any policy of insurance, evidence of renewal of such insurance upon the terms and conditions herein required.
(e)In the event any Borrower fails to provide Agent with evidence of the insurance coverage required by this Agreement, Agent may purchase insurance at Borrowers’ expense to protect Agent’s interests in the Collateral if Borrower fails to obtain insurance coverage as required by clause (c) above within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of notice from Agent of such failure, except if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing Agent may purchase insurance pursuant to this Section 4.4(e) without first notifying Borrower of such failure (but shall endeavor in good faith to provide Borrowers notice of such purchase within two (2) Business Days following such purchase).  This insurance may, but need not, protect such Borrower’s interests.  The coverage purchased by Agent may not pay any claim made by such Borrower or any claim that is made against such Borrower in connection with the Collateral.  Such Borrower may later cancel any insurance purchased by Agent, but only after providing Agent with evidence that such Borrower has obtained insurance as required by this Agreement.  If Agent purchases insurance for the Collateral, Borrowers will be responsible for the costs of that insurance to the fullest extent provided by law, including interest and other charges imposed by Agent in connection with the placement of the insurance, until the effective date of the cancellation or expiration of the insurance.  The costs of the insurance may be added to the Obligations.  The costs of the insurance may be more than the cost of insurance such Borrower is able to obtain on its own; provided however, that Agent shall use its Permitted Discretion in selecting any such insurance policies.

Section 10.3UCC Remedies.
(a)Upon the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default under this Agreement or the other Financing Documents, Agent, in addition to all other rights, options, and remedies granted to Agent under this Agreement or at law or in equity, may exercise, either directly or through one or more assignees or designees, all rights and remedies granted to it under all Financing Documents and under the UCC in effect in the applicable jurisdiction(s) and under any other applicable law; including, without limitation:
(i)the right to take possession of, send notices regarding, and collect directly the Collateral, with or without judicial process;
(ii)the right to (by its own means or with judicial assistance) enter any of Borrowers’ premises and take possession of the Collateral, or render it unusable, or to render it usable or saleable, or dispose of the Collateral on such premises in compliance with subsection (iii) below and to take possession of Borrowers’ original books and records, to obtain access to Borrowers’ data processing equipment, computer hardware and software relating to the Collateral and to use all of the foregoing and the information contained therein in any manner Agent deems appropriate, without any liability for rent, storage, utilities, or other sums, and Borrowers shall not resist or interfere with such action (if Borrowers’ books and records are prepared or maintained by an accounting service, contractor or other third party agent, Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize such service, contractor or other agent, upon notice by Agent to such Person that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to deliver to Agent or its designees such 
87 

 
books and records, and to follow Agent’s instructions with respect to further services to be rendered);
(iii)the right to require Borrowers at Borrowers’ expense to assemble all or any part of the Collateral and make it available to Agent at any place designated by Lender;
(iv)the right to notify postal authorities to change the address for delivery of Borrowers’ mail to an address designated by Agent and to receive, open and dispose of all mail addressed to any Borrower; and/or
(v)the right to enforce Borrowers’ rights against Account Debtors and other obligors, including, without limitation, (i) the right to collect Accounts directly in Agent’s own name (as agent for Lenders) and to charge the collection costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, to Borrowers, and (ii) the right, in the name of Agent or any designee of Agent or Borrowers, to verify the validity, amount or any other matter relating to any Accounts by mail, telephone, telegraph or otherwise, including, without limitation, verification of Borrowers’ compliance with applicable Laws.  Borrowers shall cooperate fully with Agent in an effort to facilitate and promptly conclude such verification process.  Such verification may include contacts between Agent and applicable federal, state and local regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the Borrowers’ affairs, all of which contacts Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize.
(b)Each Borrower agrees that a notice received by it at least ten (10) days before the time of any intended public sale, or the time after which any private sale or other disposition of the Collateral is to be made, shall be deemed to be reasonable notice of such sale or other disposition.  If permitted by applicable law, any perishable Collateral which threatens to speedily decline in value or which is sold on a recognized market may be sold immediately by Agent without prior notice to Borrowers.  At any sale or disposition of Collateral, Agent may (to the extent permitted by applicable law) purchase all or any part of the Collateral, free from any right of redemption by Borrowers, which right is hereby waived and released.  Each Borrower covenants and agrees not to interfere with or impose any obstacle to Agent’s exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral.  Agent shall have no obligation to clean-up or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale.  Agent may comply with any applicable state or federal law requirements in connection with a disposition of the Collateral and compliance will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral.  Agent may sell the Collateral without giving any warranties as to the Collateral.  Agent may specifically disclaim any warranties of title or the like.  This procedure will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral.  If Agent sells any of the Collateral upon credit, Borrowers will be credited only with payments actually made by the purchaser, received by Agent and applied to the indebtedness of the purchaser.  In the event the purchaser fails to pay for the Collateral, Agent may resell the Collateral and Borrowers shall be credited with the proceeds of the sale. Borrowers shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all Obligations.
(c)Without restricting the generality of the foregoing and for the purposes aforesaid, each Borrower hereby appoints and constitutes Agent its lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution in the Collateral, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to (i) use unadvanced funds remaining under this Agreement or which may be reserved, escrowed or set aside for any purposes hereunder at any time, or to advance funds in excess of the face amount of the Notes, (ii) pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and claims, which may be Liens or security interests, or to avoid such bills and claims becoming Liens against the Collateral, (iii) execute all applications and certificates in the name of such Borrower and to prosecute and defend all actions or 
88 

 
proceedings in connection with the Collateral, and (iv) do any and every act which such Borrower might do in its own behalf; it being understood and agreed that this power of attorney in this subsection (c) shall be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.
(d)Solely for the purpose of enabling Agent to exercise rights and remedies under this Article 10 following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, subject to any right of any third parties and/or any agreement between any Borrower and any third party to the extent not granted or entered into in contravention of the terms of this Agreement, Agent and each Lender is hereby granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free license or other right to use, without charge, Borrowers’ labels, rights of use of any name, any other Intellectual Property and advertising matter, and any similar property as it pertains to the Collateral, in completing production of, advertising for sale, and selling any Collateral and, in connection with Agent’s exercise of its rights under this Article, Borrowers’ rights under all licenses (whether as licensor or licensee) and all franchise agreements inure to Agent’s and each Lender’s benefit. 
Section 10.4Reserved. 
Section 10.5Default Rate of Interest.  At the election of Agent or Required Lenders, after the occurrence of an Event of Default and for so long as it continues, the overdue principal and interest with respect to any Loans shall bear interest at rates that are two percent (2.0%) per annum in excess of the rates otherwise payable under this Agreement; provided, however, that in the case of any Event of Default specified in Section 10.1(e) or 10.1(f) above, such default rates shall apply immediately and automatically without the need for any election or action of any kind on the part of Agent or any Lender.
Section 10.6Setoff Rights.  During the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is hereby authorized by each Borrower at any time or from time to time, with reasonably prompt subsequent notice to such Borrower (any prior or contemporaneous notice being hereby expressly waived) to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all (a) balances held by such Lender or any of such Lender’s Affiliates at any of its offices for the account of such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (regardless of whether such balances are then due to such Borrower or its Subsidiaries), and (b) other property at any time held or owing by such Lender to or for the credit or for the account of such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, against and on account of any of the Obligations; except that no Lender shall exercise any such right without the prior written consent of Agent.  Any Lender exercising a right to set off shall purchase for cash (and the other Lenders shall sell) interests in each of such other Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Obligations as would be necessary to cause all Lenders to share the amount so set off with each other Lender in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share of the Obligations.  Each Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that any Lender and any of such Lender’s Affiliates may exercise its right to set off with respect to the Obligations as provided in this Section 10.6.
Section 10.7Application of Proceeds.  
(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Borrower irrevocably waives the right to direct the application of any and all payments at any time or times thereafter received by Agent from or on behalf of such Borrower or any Guarantor of all or any part of the Obligations, and, as between Borrowers on the one hand and Agent and Lenders on the other, Agent shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and to reapply any and all payments received against the Obligations in such manner as Agent may deem advisable notwithstanding any previous application by Agent.
89 

 
(b)Following the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, but absent the occurrence and continuance of an Acceleration Event, Agent shall apply any and all payments received by Agent in respect of the Obligations, and any and all proceeds of Collateral received by Agent, in such order as Agent may from time to time elect.
(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if an Acceleration Event shall have occurred, and so long as it continues, Agent shall apply any and all payments received by Agent in respect of the Obligations, and any and all proceeds of Collateral received by Agent, in the following order:  first, to all fees, costs, indemnities, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred by or owing to Agent with respect to this Agreement, the other Financing Documents or the Collateral; second, to all fees, costs, indemnities, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred by or owing to any Lender with respect to this Agreement, the other Financing Documents or the Collateral; third, to accrued and unpaid interest on the Obligations (including any interest which, but for the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued on such amounts); fourth, to the principal amount of the Obligations outstanding; and fifth to any other indebtedness or obligations of Borrowers owing to Agent or any Lender under the Financing Documents. Any balance remaining shall be delivered to Borrowers or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such balance or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.  In carrying out the foregoing, (y) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to the application to the next succeeding category, and (z) each of the Persons entitled to receive a payment in any particular category shall receive an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of amounts available to be applied pursuant thereto for such category.
Section 10.8Waivers.
(a)Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Borrower waives:  (i) presentment, demand and protest, and notice of presentment, dishonor, intent to accelerate, acceleration, protest, default, nonpayment, maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension or renewal of any or all Financing Documents, the Notes or any other notes, commercial paper, accounts, contracts, documents, Instruments, Chattel Paper and Guarantees at any time held by Lenders on which any Borrower may in any way be liable, and hereby ratifies and confirms whatever Lenders may do in this regard; (ii) all rights to notice and a hearing prior to Agent’s or any Lender’s taking possession or control of, or to Agent’s or any Lender’s replevy, attachment or levy upon, any Collateral or any bond or security which might be required by any court prior to allowing Agent or any Lender to exercise any of its remedies; and (iii) the benefit of all valuation, appraisal and exemption Laws.  Each Borrower acknowledges that it has been advised by counsel of its choices and decisions with respect to this Agreement, the other Financing Documents and the transactions evidenced hereby and thereby.
(b)Each Borrower for itself and all its successors and assigns, (i) agrees that its liability shall not be in any manner affected by any indulgence, extension of time, renewal, waiver, or modification granted or consented to by Lender; (ii) consents to any indulgences and all extensions of time, renewals, waivers, or modifications that may be granted by Agent or any Lender with respect to the payment or other provisions of the Financing Documents, and to any substitution, exchange or release of the Collateral, or any part thereof, with or without substitution, and agrees to the addition or release of any Borrower, endorsers, guarantors, or sureties, or whether primarily or secondarily liable, without notice to any other Borrower and without affecting its liability hereunder; (iii) agrees that its liability shall be unconditional and without regard to the liability of any other Borrower, Agent or any Lender for any tax on the indebtedness; and (iv) to the fullest extent permitted by law, expressly waives the benefit of any statute or rule of law or equity now provided, or which may hereafter be provided, which would produce a result contrary to or in conflict with the foregoing.
90 

 
(c)To the extent that Agent or any Lender may have acquiesced in any noncompliance with any requirements or conditions precedent to the closing of the Loans or to any subsequent disbursement of Loan proceeds, such acquiescence shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver by Agent or any Lender of such requirements with respect to any future disbursements of Loan proceeds and Agent may at any time after such acquiescence require Borrowers to comply with all such requirements.  Any forbearance by Agent or Lender in exercising any right or remedy under any of the Financing Documents, or otherwise afforded by applicable law, including any failure to accelerate the maturity date of the Loans, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy nor shall it serve as a novation of the Notes or as a reinstatement of the Loans or a waiver of such right of acceleration or the right to insist upon strict compliance of the terms of the Financing Documents.  Agent’s or any Lender’s acceptance of payment of any sum secured by any of the Financing Documents after the due date of such payment shall not be a waiver of Agent’s and such Lender’s right to either require prompt payment when due of all other sums so secured or to declare a default for failure to make prompt payment.  The procurement of insurance or the payment of taxes or other Liens or charges by Agent as the result of an Event of Default shall not be a waiver of Agent’s right to accelerate the maturity of the Loans, nor shall Agent’s receipt of any condemnation awards, insurance proceeds, or damages under this Agreement operate to cure or waive any Credit Party’s default in payment of sums secured by any of the Financing Documents.
(d)Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Agreement or the other Financing Documents, each Borrower agrees that if an Event of Default is continuing (i) Agent and Lenders shall not be subject to any “one action” or “election of remedies” law or rule, and (ii) all Liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided to Agent or Lenders shall remain in full force and effect until Agent or Lenders have exhausted all remedies against the Collateral and any other properties owned by Borrowers and the Financing Documents and other security instruments or agreements securing the Loans have been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized upon in satisfaction of Borrowers’ obligations under the Financing Documents.
(e)Nothing contained herein or in any other Financing Document shall be construed as requiring Agent or any Lender to resort to any part of the Collateral for the satisfaction of any of Borrowers’ obligations under the Financing Documents in preference or priority to any other Collateral at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, and Agent may seek satisfaction out of all of the Collateral or any part thereof, in its absolute discretion in respect of Borrowers’ obligations under the Financing Documents.  In addition, at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Agent shall have the right from time to time to partially foreclose upon any Collateral in any manner and for any amounts secured by the Financing Documents then due and payable as determined by Agent in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, the following circumstances:  (i) in the event any Borrower defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of one or more scheduled payments of principal and/or interest, Agent may foreclose upon all or any part of the Collateral to recover such delinquent payments, or (ii) in the event Agent elects to accelerate less than the entire outstanding principal balance of the Loans, Agent may foreclose all or any part of the Collateral to recover so much of the principal balance of the Loans as Lender may accelerate and such other sums secured by one or more of the Financing Documents as Agent may elect.  Notwithstanding one or more partial foreclosures, any unforeclosed Collateral shall remain subject to the Financing Documents to secure payment of sums secured by the Financing Documents and not previously recovered.
(f)To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives in the event of foreclosure of any or all of the Collateral any equitable right otherwise available to any Credit Party which would require the separate sale of any of the Collateral or require Agent or Lenders to exhaust their remedies against any part of the Collateral before 
91 

 
proceeding against any other part of the Collateral; and further in the event of such foreclosure each Borrower does hereby expressly consent to and authorize, at the option of Agent, the foreclosure and sale either separately or together of each part of the Collateral.
Section 10.9Injunctive Relief.  The parties acknowledge and agree that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any Credit Party’s obligations under any Financing Documents, Agent and Lenders may have no adequate remedy in money damages and, accordingly, shall be entitled to an injunction (including, without limitation, a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, writ of attachment, or order compelling an audit) against such breach or threatened breach, including, without limitation, maintaining any cash management and collection procedure described herein.  However, no specification in this Agreement of a specific legal or equitable remedy shall be construed as a waiver or prohibition against any other legal or equitable remedies in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Agreement.  Each Credit Party waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the requirement of the posting of any bond in connection with such injunctive relief.  By joining in the Financing Documents as a Credit Party, each Credit Party specifically joins in this Section as if this Section were a part of each Financing Document executed by such Credit Party.
Section 10.10Marshalling; Payments Set Aside.  Neither Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in payment of any or all of the Obligations.  To the extent that Borrower makes any payment or Agent enforces its Liens or Agent or any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such enforcement or set-off is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, or required to be repaid by anyone, then to the extent of such recovery, the Obligations or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or set-off had not occurred.
Article 11 - AGENT
Section 11.1Appointment and Authorization.  Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes Agent to enter into each of the Financing Documents to which it is a party (other than this Agreement) on its behalf and to take such actions as Agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Financing Documents as are delegated to Agent by the terms thereof, together with all such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Subject to the terms of Section 11.16 and to the terms of the other Financing Documents, Agent is authorized and empowered to amend, modify, or waive any provisions of this Agreement or the other Financing Documents on behalf of Lenders.  The provisions of this Article 11 are solely for the benefit of Agent and Lenders and neither any Borrower nor any other Credit Party shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions hereof.  In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement, Agent shall act solely as agent of Lenders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with or for any Borrower or any other Credit Party.  Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder, or under the Financing Documents, by or through its agents, servicers, trustees, investment managers or employees.  
Section 11.2Agent and Affiliates.  Agent shall have the same rights and powers under the Financing Documents as any other Lender and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not Agent, and Agent and its Affiliates may lend money to, invest in and generally engage in any kind of business with each Credit Party or Affiliate of any Credit Party as if it were not Agent hereunder.
Section 11.3Action by Agent.  The duties of Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature.  Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any 
92 

 
Lender.  Nothing in this Agreement or any of the Financing Documents is intended to or shall be construed to impose upon Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any of the Financing Documents except as expressly set forth herein or therein.
Section 11.4Consultation with Experts.  Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.
Section 11.5Liability of Agent.  Neither Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents, trustees, investment managers, servicers or employees shall be liable to any Lender for any action taken or not taken by it in connection with the Financing Documents, except that Agent shall be liable with respect to its specific duties set forth hereunder but only to the extent of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct in the discharge thereof as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  Neither Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents, trustees, investment managers, servicers or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (a) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Financing Document or any borrowing hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements specified in any Financing Document; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in any Financing Document; (d) the validity, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Financing Document, any Lien purported to be created or perfected thereby or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; (e) the existence or non-existence of any Default or Event of Default; or (f) the financial condition of any Credit Party.  Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or other writing (which may be a bank wire, facsimile or electronic transmission or similar writing) believed by it to be genuine or to be signed by the proper party or parties.  Agent shall not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole recourse of any Lender to whom payment was due but not made, shall be to recover from other Lenders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to be entitled (and such other Lenders hereby agree to return to such Lender any such erroneous payments received by them).
Section 11.6Indemnification.  Each Lender shall, in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, indemnify Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by Borrowers) upon demand against any cost, expense (including counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) that Agent may suffer or incur in connection with the Financing Documents or any action taken or omitted by Agent hereunder or thereunder.  If any indemnity furnished to Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against even if so directed by Required Lenders until such additional indemnity is furnished.
Section 11.7Right to Request and Act on Instructions.  Agent may at any time request instructions from Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this Agreement or of any of the Financing Documents Agent is permitted or desires to take or to grant, and if such instructions are promptly requested, Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from any action or withholding any approval under any of the Financing Documents until it shall have received such instructions from Required Lenders or all or such other portion of the Lenders as shall be prescribed by this Agreement.  Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents in accordance with the instructions of Required Lenders (or all or such other portion of the Lenders as shall be prescribed by this Agreement) and, notwithstanding the instructions of 
93 

 
Required Lenders (or such other applicable portion of the Lenders), Agent shall have no obligation to take any action if it believes, in good faith, that such action would violate applicable Law or exposes Agent to any liability for which it has not received satisfactory indemnification in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6.
Section 11.8Credit Decision.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking any action under the Financing Documents.
Section 11.9Collateral Matters.  Lenders irrevocably authorize Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to (a) release any Lien granted to or held by Agent under any Security Document (i) upon termination of the Revolving Loan Commitment and payment in full of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no claim has been made); or (ii) constituting property sold or disposed of as part of or in connection with any disposition permitted under any Financing Document (it being understood and agreed that Agent may conclusively rely without further inquiry on a certificate of a Responsible Officer as to the sale or other disposition of property being made in full compliance with the provisions of the Financing Documents); and (b) subordinate any Lien granted to or held by Agent under any Security Document to a Permitted Lien that is allowed to have priority over the Liens granted to or held by Agent pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Liens”.  Upon request by Agent at any time, Lenders will confirm Agent’s authority to release and/or subordinate particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 11.9.
Section 11.10Agency for Perfection.  Agent and each Lender hereby appoint each other Lender as agent for the purpose of perfecting Agent’s security interest in assets which, in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code in any applicable jurisdiction, can be perfected by possession or control.  Should any Lender (other than Agent) obtain possession or control of any such assets, such Lender shall notify Agent thereof, and, promptly upon Agent’s request therefor, shall deliver such assets to Agent or in accordance with Agent’s instructions or transfer control to Agent in accordance with Agent’s instructions.  Each Lender agrees that it will not have any right individually to enforce or seek to enforce any Security Document or to realize upon any Collateral for the Loan unless instructed to do so by Agent (or consented to by Agent), it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised only by Agent.
Section 11.11Notice of Default.  Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to Agent for the account of Lenders, unless Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or a Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default”.  Agent will notify each Lender of its receipt of any such notice.  Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by Required Lenders (or all or such other portion of the Lenders as shall be prescribed by this Agreement) in accordance with the terms hereof.  Unless and until Agent has received any such request, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interests of Lenders.

Section 11.12Assignment by Agent; Resignation of Agent; Successor Agent.
(a)Agent may at any time assign its rights, powers, privileges and duties hereunder to any Eligible Assignee that is (i) another Lender or an Affiliate of Agent or any Approved Fund, or (ii) any Person to whom Agent, in its capacity as a Lender, has assigned (or will assign, in conjunction with such assignment of agency rights hereunder) 50% or more of its Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in each case without the consent of the Lenders or Borrowers.  Following any such assignment, Agent shall endeavor to give notice to the Lenders and shall give notice to Borrowers.  Failure to give such notice shall not affect such assignment in any way or cause the assignment to be ineffective.  An assignment by Agent pursuant to this subsection (a) shall not be deemed a resignation by Agent for purposes of subsection (b) below.
(b)Without limiting the rights of Agent to designate an assignee pursuant to subsection (a) above, Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and Borrowers.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent, which successor Agent shall be an Eligible Assignee.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within ten (10) Business Days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which successor Agent shall be an Eligible Assignee; provided, however, that if Agent shall notify Borrowers and the Lenders that no Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice from Agent that no Person has accepted such appointment and, from and following delivery of such notice, (i) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Financing Documents, and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this paragraph.  
(c)Upon (i) an assignment permitted by subsection (a) above, or (ii) the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Agent pursuant to subsection (b) above, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Financing Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph).  The fees payable by Borrowers to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between Borrowers and such successor.  After the retiring Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Financing Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.12 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent and its sub-agents in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting or was continuing to act as Agent.
Section 11.13Payment and Sharing of Payment.
(a)Revolving Loan Advances, Payments and Settlements; Interest and Fee Payments.
(i)Agent shall have the right, on behalf of Revolving Lenders to disburse funds to Borrowers for all Revolving Loans requested or deemed requested by Borrowers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  Agent shall be conclusively entitled to assume, for purposes of the preceding sentence, that each Revolving Lender, other than any Non-Funding Lenders, will fund its Pro Rata Share of all Revolving Loans requested by Borrowers.  Each Revolving Lender shall reimburse Agent on demand, in accordance with the provisions of the immediately following paragraph, for all funds disbursed on its behalf by Agent pursuant to the 
95 

 
first sentence of this clause (i), or if Agent so requests, each Revolving Lender will remit to Agent its Pro Rata Share of any Revolving Loan before Agent disburses the same to a Borrower.  If Agent elects to require that each Revolving Lender make funds available to Agent, prior to a disbursement by Agent to a Borrower, Agent shall advise each Revolving Lender by telephone, facsimile or e-mail of the amount of such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loan requested by such Borrower no later than noon (Eastern time) on the date of funding of such Revolving Loan, and each such Revolving Lender shall pay Agent on such date such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such requested Revolving Loan, in same day funds, by wire transfer to the Payment Account, or such other account as may be identified by Agent to Revolving Lenders from time to time.  If any Lender fails to pay the amount of its Pro Rata Share of any funds advanced by Agent pursuant to the first sentence of this clause (i) within one (1) Business Day after Agent’s demand, Agent shall promptly notify Borrower Representative, and Borrowers shall immediately repay such amount to Agent.  Any repayment required by Borrowers pursuant to this Section 11.13 shall be accompanied by accrued interest thereon from and including the date such amount is made available to a Borrower to but excluding the date of payment at the rate of interest then applicable to Revolving Loans.  Nothing in this Section 11.13 or elsewhere in this Agreement or the other Financing Documents shall be deemed to require Agent to advance funds on behalf of any Lender or to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Agent or any Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
(ii)On a Business Day of each week as selected from time to time by Agent, or more frequently (including daily), if Agent so elects (each such day being a “Settlement Date”), Agent will advise each Revolving Lender by telephone, facsimile or e-mail of the amount of each such Revolving Lender’s percentage interest of the Revolving Loan balance as of the close of business of the Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date.  In the event that payments are necessary to adjust the amount of such Revolving Lender’s actual percentage interest of the Revolving Loans to such Lender’s required percentage interest of the Revolving Loan balance as of any Settlement Date, the Revolving Lender from which such payment is due shall pay Agent, without setoff or discount, to the Payment Account before 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the Business Day following the Settlement Date the full amount necessary to make such adjustment.  Any obligation arising pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever.  In the event settlement shall not have occurred by the date and time specified in the second preceding sentence, interest shall accrue on the unsettled amount at the rate of interest then applicable to Revolving Loans.
(iii)On each Settlement Date, Agent shall advise each Revolving Lender by telephone, facsimile or e-mail of the amount of such Revolving Lender’s percentage interest of principal, interest and fees paid for the benefit of Revolving Lenders with respect to each applicable Revolving Loan, to the extent of such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Loan Exposure with respect thereto, and shall make payment to such Revolving Lender before 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the Business Day following the Settlement Date of such amounts in accordance with wire instructions delivered by such Revolving Lender to Agent, as the same may be modified from time to time by written notice to Agent; provided, however, that, in the case such Revolving Lender is a Defaulted Lender, Agent shall be entitled to set off the funding short-fall against that Defaulted Lender’s respective share of all payments received from any Borrower.
(iv)On the Closing Date, Agent, on behalf of Lenders, may elect to advance to Borrowers the full amount of the initial Loans to be made on the Closing Date prior to receiving funds from Lenders, in reliance upon each Lender’s commitment to make its Pro Rata 
96 

 
Share of such Loans to Borrowers in a timely manner on such date.  If Agent elects to advance the initial Loans to Borrower in such manner, Agent shall be entitled to receive all interest that accrues on the Closing Date on each Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such Loans unless Agent receives such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such Loans before 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing Date.
(v)It is understood that for purposes of advances to Borrowers made pursuant to this Section 11.13, Agent will be using the funds of Agent, and pending settlement, (A) all funds transferred from the Payment Account to the outstanding Revolving Loans shall be applied first to advances made by Agent to Borrowers pursuant to this Section 11.13, and (B) all interest accruing on such advances shall be payable to Agent.  
(vi)The provisions of this Section 11.13(a) shall be deemed to be binding upon Agent and Lenders notwithstanding the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, or any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding pertaining to any Borrower or any other Credit Party.
(b)[Reserved].  
(c)Return of Payments.
(i)If Agent pays an amount to a Lender under this Agreement in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received by Agent from a Borrower and such related payment is not received by Agent, then Agent will be entitled to recover such amount from such Lender on demand without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind, together with interest accruing on a daily basis at the Federal Funds Rate.
(ii)If Agent determines at any time that any amount received by Agent under this Agreement must be returned to any Borrower or paid to any other Person pursuant to any insolvency law or otherwise, then, notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement or any other Financing Document, Agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Lender.  In addition, each Lender will repay to Agent on demand any portion of such amount that Agent has distributed to such Lender, together with interest at such rate, if any, as Agent is required to pay to any Borrower or such other Person, without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.
(d)Defaulted Lenders.  The failure of any Defaulted Lender to make any payment required by it hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations to make payment, but neither any other Lender nor Agent shall be responsible for the failure of any Defaulted Lender to make any payment required hereunder.  Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, a Defaulted Lender shall not have any voting or consent rights under or with respect to any Financing Document or constitute a “Lender” (or be included in the calculation of “Required Lenders” hereunder) for any voting or consent rights under or with respect to any Financing Document.
(e)Sharing of Payments.  If any Lender shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of setoff or otherwise) on account of any Loan (other than pursuant to the terms of Section 2.8(d)) in excess of its Pro Rata Share of payments entitled pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 11.13, such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such participations in extensions of credit made by such other Lenders (without recourse, representation or warranty) as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter required to be returned or otherwise recovered from such purchasing 
97 

 
Lender, such portion of such purchase shall be rescinded and each Lender which has sold a participation to the purchasing Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the ratable extent of such return or recovery, without interest.  Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this clause (e) may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including pursuant to Section 10.6) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of Borrowers in the amount of such participation).  If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this clause (e) applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this clause (e) to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.
Section 11.14Right to Perform, Preserve and Protect.  If any Credit Party fails to perform any obligation hereunder or under any other Financing Document, Agent itself may, but shall not be obligated to, cause such obligation to be performed at Borrowers’ expense.  Agent is further authorized by Borrowers and the Lenders to make expenditures from time to time which Agent, in its Permitted Discretion, deems necessary or desirable to (a) preserve or protect the business conducted by Borrowers, the Collateral, or any portion thereof, and/or (b) enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Loan and other Obligations.  Each Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse Agent on demand for any and all costs, liabilities and obligations incurred by Agent pursuant to this Section 11.14.  Each Lender hereby agrees to indemnify Agent upon demand for any and all costs, liabilities and obligations incurred by Agent pursuant to this Section 11.14, in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6.
Section 11.15Additional Titled Agents.  Except for rights and powers, if any, expressly reserved under this Agreement to any bookrunner, arranger or to any titled agent named on the cover page of this Agreement, other than Agent (collectively, the “Additional Titled Agents”), and except for obligations, liabilities, duties and responsibilities, if any, expressly assumed under this Agreement by any Additional Titled Agent, no Additional Titled Agent, in such capacity, has any rights, powers, liabilities, duties or responsibilities hereunder or under any of the other Financing Documents.  Without limiting the foregoing, no Additional Titled Agent shall have nor be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender.  At any time that any Lender serving as an Additional Titled Agent shall have transferred to any other Person (other than any Affiliates) all of its interests in the Loan, such Lender shall be deemed to have concurrently resigned as such Additional Titled Agent.
Section 11.16Amendments and Waivers.
(a)No provision of this Agreement or any other Financing Document may be amended, waived or otherwise modified unless such amendment, waiver or other modification is in writing and is signed or otherwise approved by Borrowers, the Required Lenders and any other Lender to the extent required under Section 11.16(b); provided, however, the Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto. 
(b)In addition to the required signatures under Section 11.16(a), no provision of this Agreement or any other Financing Document may be amended, waived or otherwise modified unless such amendment, waiver or other modification is in writing and is signed or otherwise approved by the following Persons:
(i)if any amendment, waiver or other modification would increase a Lender’s funding obligations in respect of any Loan, by such Lender; and/or
(ii)if the rights or duties of Agent are affected thereby, by Agent;
98 

 
provided, however, that, in each of (i) and (ii) above, no such amendment, waiver or other modification shall, unless signed or otherwise approved in writing by all the Lenders directly affected thereby, (A) reduce the principal of, rate of interest on or any fees with respect to any Loan or forgive any principal, interest (other than default interest) or fees (other than late charges) with respect to any Loan; (B) postpone the date fixed for, or waive, any payment (other than any mandatory prepayment pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(ii)) of principal of any Loan, or of interest on any Loan (other than default interest) or any fees provided for hereunder (other than late charges) or postpone the date of termination of any commitment of any Lender hereunder; (C) change the definition of the term Required Lenders or the percentage of Lenders which shall be required for Lenders to take any action hereunder; (D) release all or substantially all of the Collateral, authorize any Borrower to sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Collateral, release any Guarantor of all or any portion of the Obligations or its Guarantee obligations with respect thereto, or consent to a transfer of any of the Intellectual Property, except, in each case with respect to this clause (D), as otherwise may be provided in this Agreement or the other Financing Documents (including in connection with any disposition permitted hereunder); (E) amend, waive or otherwise modify this Section 11.16(b) or the definitions of the terms used in this Section 11.16(b) insofar as the definitions affect the substance of this Section 11.16(b);  (F) consent to the assignment, delegation or other transfer by any Credit Party of any of its rights and obligations under any Financing Document or release any Borrower of its payment obligations under any Financing Document, except, in each case with respect to this clause (F), pursuant to a merger or consolidation permitted pursuant to this Agreement; or (G) amend any of the provisions of Section 10.7 or amend any of the definitions Pro Rata Share, Revolving Loan Commitment, Revolving Loan Commitment Amount, Revolving Loan Commitment Percentage or that provide for the Lenders to receive their Pro Rata Shares of any fees, payments, setoffs or proceeds of Collateral hereunder.  It is hereby understood and agreed that all Lenders shall be deemed directly affected by an amendment, waiver or other modification of the type described in the preceding clauses (C), (D), (E), (F) and (G) of the preceding sentence.
Section 11.17Assignments and Participations.
(a)Assignments.
(i)Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or any portion of such Lender’s Loan together with all related obligations of such Lender hereunder.  Except as Agent may otherwise agree, the amount of any such assignment (determined as of the date of the applicable Assignment Agreement or, if a “Trade Date” is specified in such Assignment Agreement, as of such Trade Date) shall be in a minimum aggregate amount equal to $1,000,000 or, if less, the assignor’s entire interests in the outstanding Loan; provided, however, that, in connection with simultaneous assignments to two or more related Approved Funds, such Approved Funds shall be treated as one assignee for purposes of determining compliance with the minimum assignment size referred to above.  Borrowers and Agent shall be entitled to continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with the interests so assigned to an Eligible Assignee until Agent shall have received and accepted an effective Assignment Agreement executed, delivered and fully completed by the applicable parties thereto and a processing fee of $3,500 to be paid by the assigning Lender; provided, however, that only one processing fee shall be payable in connection with simultaneous assignments to two or more related Approved Funds.
(ii)From and after the date on which the conditions described above have been met, (A) such Eligible Assignee shall be deemed automatically to have become a party hereto and, to the extent of the interests assigned to such Eligible Assignee pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder, and (B) the assigning Lender, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it 
99 

 
pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall be released from its rights and obligations hereunder (other than those that survive termination pursuant to Section 12.1).  Upon the request of the Eligible Assignee (and, as applicable, the assigning Lender) pursuant to an effective Assignment Agreement, each Borrower shall execute and deliver to Agent for delivery to the Eligible Assignee (and, as applicable, the assigning Lender) Notes in the aggregate principal amount of the Eligible Assignee’s Loan (and, as applicable, Notes in the principal amount of that portion of the principal amount of the Loan retained by the assigning Lender).  Upon receipt by the assigning Lender of such Note, the assigning Lender shall return to Borrower Representative any prior Note held by it.
(iii)Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of Borrower, shall maintain at the office of its servicer located in Bethesda, Maryland a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of each Lender, and the commitments of, and principal amount of the Loan owing to, such Lender pursuant to the terms hereof (the “Register”). The entries in such Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and Borrower, Agent and Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded therein pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. Such Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time upon reasonable prior notice to Agent. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this  purpose as an agent of Borrower maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant’s interest in the Obligations (each, a “Participant Register”). The entries in the Participant Registers shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. Each Participant Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower and Agent at any reasonable time upon reasonable prior notice to the applicable Lender; provided, that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Financing Document) to any Person (including Borrower) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury regulations.  For the avoidance of doubt, Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(iv)Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.17(a) or any other provision of this Agreement, any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(v)Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.17(a) or any other provision of this Agreement, Agent has the right, but not the obligation, to effectuate assignments of Loan via an electronic settlement system acceptable to Agent as designated in writing from time to time to the Lenders by Agent (the “Settlement Service”).  At any time when Agent elects, in its sole discretion, to implement such Settlement Service, each such assignment shall be effected by the assigning Lender and proposed assignee pursuant to the procedures then in effect under the Settlement Service, which procedures shall be consistent with the other provisions of this Section 11.17(a).  Each assigning Lender and proposed Eligible Assignee shall comply with the requirements of the Settlement Service in connection with effecting any assignment of Loan pursuant to the Settlement Service.  With the prior written approval of Agent, 
100 

 
Agent’s approval of such Eligible Assignee shall be deemed to have been automatically granted with respect to any transfer effected through the Settlement Service.  Assignments and assumptions of the Loan shall be effected by the provisions otherwise set forth herein until Agent notifies Lenders of the Settlement Service as set forth herein.
(b)Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower or Agent, sell to one or more Persons (other than any Borrower or any Borrower’s Affiliates and, so long as no Specified Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any Disqualified Institution) participating interests in its Loan, commitments or other interests hereunder (any such Person, a “Participant”).  In the event of a sale by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, (i) such Lender’s obligations hereunder shall remain unchanged for all purposes, (ii) Borrowers and Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations hereunder, and (iii) all amounts payable by each Borrower shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation and shall be paid directly to such Lender.  Each Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due and payable (as a result of acceleration or otherwise), each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement; provided, however, that such right of set-off shall be subject to the obligation of each Participant to share with Lenders, and Lenders agree to share with each Participant, as provided in Section 11.5.
(c)Replacement of Lenders.  Within thirty (30) days after: (i) receipt by Agent of notice and demand from any Lender for payment of additional costs as provided in Section 2.8(h), which demand shall not have been revoked, (ii) any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.8(a) through (h), (iii) any Lender is a Defaulted Lender, and the circumstances causing such status shall not have been cured or waived; or (iv) any failure by any Lender to consent to a requested amendment, waiver or modification to any Financing Document in which Required Lenders have already consented to such amendment, waiver or modification but the consent of each Lender, or each Lender affected thereby, is required with respect thereto (each relevant Lender in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) being an “Affected Lender”) each of Borrower Representative and Agent may, at its option, notify such Affected Lender and, in the case of Borrowers’ election, Agent, of such Person’s intention to obtain, at Borrowers’ expense, a replacement Lender (“Replacement Lender”) for such Lender, which Replacement Lender shall be an Eligible Assignee and, in the event the Replacement Lender is to replace an Affected Lender described in the preceding clause (iv), such Replacement Lender consents to the requested amendment, waiver or modification making the replaced Lender an Affected Lender.  In the event Borrowers or Agent, as applicable, obtains a Replacement Lender within ninety (90) days following notice of its intention to do so, the Affected Lender shall sell, at par, and assign all of its Loan and funding commitments hereunder to such Replacement Lender in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 11.17(a); provided, however, that (A) Borrowers shall have reimbursed such Lender for its increased costs and additional payments for which it is entitled to reimbursement under Section 2.8(a) through (h), as applicable, of this Agreement through the date of such sale and assignment, and (B) Borrowers shall pay to Agent the $3,500 processing fee in respect of such assignment.  In the event that a replaced Lender does not execute an Assignment Agreement pursuant to Section 11.17(a) within five (5) Business Days after receipt by such replaced Lender of notice of replacement pursuant to this Section 11.17(c) and presentation to such replaced Lender of an Assignment Agreement evidencing an assignment pursuant to this Section 11.17(c), such replaced Lender shall be deemed to have consented to the terms of such Assignment Agreement, and any such Assignment Agreement executed by Agent, the Replacement Lender and, to the extent required pursuant to Section 11.17(a), Borrowers, shall be effective for purposes of this Section 11.17(c) and Section 11.17(a).  Upon any such assignment and 
101 

 
payment, such replaced Lender shall no longer constitute a “Lender” for purposes hereof, other than with respect to such rights and obligations that survive termination as set forth in Section 12.1.
(d)Credit Party Assignments.  No Credit Party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or other obligations hereunder or under any other Financing Document without the prior written consent of Agent and each Lender.
Section 11.18Funding and Settlement Provisions Applicable When Non-Funding Lenders Exist.  So long as Agent has not waived the conditions to the funding of Loans set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 2.1, any Lender may deliver a notice to Agent stating that such Lender shall cease making Revolving Loans due to the non-satisfaction of one or more conditions to funding Loans set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 2.1, and specifying any such non-satisfied conditions.  Any Lender delivering any such notice shall become a non-funding Lender (a “Non-Funding Lender”) for purposes of this Agreement commencing on the Business Day following receipt by Agent of such notice, and shall cease to be a Non-Funding Lender on the date on which such Lender has either revoked the effectiveness of such notice or acknowledged in writing to each of Agent the satisfaction of the condition(s) specified in such notice, or Required Lenders waive the conditions to the funding of such Loans giving rise to such notice by Non-Funding Lender.  Each Non-Funding Lender shall remain a Lender for purposes of this Agreement to the extent that such Non-Funding Lender has Revolving Loan Outstanding in excess of Zero Dollars ($0); provided, however, that during any period of time that any Non-Funding Lender exists, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary set forth herein, the following provisions shall apply: 
(a)For purposes of determining the Pro Rata Share of each Lender under clause (b) of the definition of such term, each Non-Funding Lender shall be deemed to have a Revolving Loan Commitment Amount as in effect immediately before such Lender became a Non-Funding Lender. 
(b)Except as provided in clause (a) above, the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount of each Non-Funding Lender shall be deemed to be Zero Dollars ($0). 
(c)The Revolving Loan Commitment at any date of determination during such period shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment Amounts of all Lenders, other than the Non-Funding Lenders as of such date plus (ii) the aggregate Revolving Loan Outstandings of all Non-Funding Lenders as of such date.
(d)[Reserved].
(e)Agent shall have no right to make or disburse Revolving Loans for the account of any Non-Funding Lender pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(i) to pay interest, fees, expenses and other charges of any Credit Party.
(f)To the extent that Agent applies proceeds of Collateral or other payments received by Agent to repayment of Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 10.7, such payments and proceeds shall be applied first in respect of Revolving Loans made at the time any Non-Funding Lenders exist, and second in respect of all other outstanding Revolving Loans.
Article 12 - MISCELLANEOUS
Section 12.1Survival.  All agreements, representations and warranties made herein and in every other Financing Document shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Financing Documents.  The provisions of Section 2.10 and Articles 11 and 12 shall survive the payment of the Obligations (both with respect to any Lender and all Lenders collectively) and any termination of 
102 

 
this Agreement and any judgment with respect to any Obligations, including any final foreclosure judgment with respect to any Security Document, and no unpaid or unperformed, current or future, Obligations will merge into any such judgment.
Section 12.2No Waivers.  No failure or delay by Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege under any Financing Document shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  The rights and remedies herein and therein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.  Any reference in any Financing Document to the “continuing” nature of any Event of Default shall not be construed as establishing or otherwise indicating that any Borrower or any other Credit Party has the independent right to cure any such Event of Default, but is rather presented merely for convenience should such Event of Default be waived in accordance with the terms of the applicable Financing Documents.
Section 12.3Notices.
(a)All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including prepaid overnight courier, facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party at its address, facsimile number or e-mail address set forth on the signature pages hereof (or, in the case of any such Lender who becomes a Lender after the date hereof, in an assignment agreement or in a notice delivered to Borrower Representative and Agent by the assignee Lender forthwith upon such assignment) or at such other address, facsimile number or e-mail address as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to Agent and Borrower Representative; provided, however, that notices, requests or other communications shall be permitted by electronic means only in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.3(b) and (c).  Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile, when such notice is transmitted to the facsimile number specified by this Section and the sender receives a confirmation of transmission from the sending facsimile machine, or (ii) if given by mail, prepaid overnight courier or any other means, when received or when receipt is refused at the applicable address specified by this Section 12.3(a).
(b)Notices and other communications to the parties hereto may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved from time to time by Agent, provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to notices sent directly to any Lender if such Lender has notified Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices by electronic communication.  Agent or Borrower Representative may, in their discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to them hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it, provided, however, that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.
(c)Unless Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the sender’s receipt of an acknowledgment from the intended recipient (such as by the “return receipt requested” function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgment), and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor, provided, however, that if any such notice or other communication is not sent or posted during normal business hours, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next Business Day.
Section 12.4Severability.  In case any provision of or obligation under this Agreement or any other Financing Document shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, 
103 

 
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
Section 12.5Headings.  Headings and captions used in the Financing Documents (including the Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes hereto and thereto) are included for convenience of reference only and shall not be given any substantive effect.
Section 12.6Confidentiality.  Agent and each Lender shall hold all non-public information regarding the Credit Parties and their respective businesses identified as such by Borrowers and obtained by Agent or any Lender pursuant to the requirements hereof in accordance with such Person’s customary procedures for handling information of such nature, except that disclosure of such information may be made (i) to their respective agents, employees, Subsidiaries, Affiliates, attorneys, auditors, professional consultants, rating agencies, insurance industry associations and portfolio management services (it being understood that such Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such information and be instructed to keep such information confidential), (ii) to prospective transferees or purchasers of any interest in the Loans, Agent or a Lender, provided, however, that any such Persons are bound by obligations of confidentiality, (iii) as required by Law, subpoena, judicial order or similar order and in connection with any litigation, (iv) as may be required in connection with the examination, audit or similar investigation of such Person to the extent such examiners, auditors or investigators have been instructed to or are otherwise obligated to maintain such information as confidential, and (v) to a Person that is a trustee, investment advisor or investment manager, collateral manager, servicer, noteholder or secured party in a Securitization (as hereinafter defined) in connection with the administration, servicing and reporting on the assets serving as collateral for such Securitization.
