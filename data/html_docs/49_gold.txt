THIS CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT (this Agreement), is entered into as of January 28, 2016, by and among the lenders identified on the signature pages hereto (each such lender and any lender that becomes a party hereto pursuant to an Incremental Facility Amendment, together with its successors and permitted assigns, is referred to herein as a Lender), TCW ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY (in its individual capacity, TCW), as Agent, DIFFERENTIAL BRANDS GROUP INC., a Delaware corporation formerly known as Joes Jeans Inc.

The parties agree as follows:
 
1.                                    DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION.
 
1.1.                        Definitions, Code Terms, Accounting Terms and Construction.  Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings specified therefor on Schedule 1.1.  Additionally, matters of (i) interpretation of terms defined in the Code, (ii) interpretation of accounting terms and (iii) construction are set forth in Schedule 1.1.
 
2.                                    LOANS AND TERMS OF PAYMENT.
 
2.1.                        Term Loan.
 
(a)                               On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the Lenders hereby agree to make to Borrowers on the Closing Date a term loan in an aggregate original principal amount equal to $50,000,000 (the Term Loan).  Each Lenders obligation to fund the Term Loan on the Closing Date shall be limited to such Lenders Term Loan Commitment, and no Lender shall have any obligation to fund any portion of the Term Loan required to be funded by any other Lender, but not so funded.  Borrowers shall not have any right to reborrow any portion of the Term Loan which is repaid or prepaid from time to time. Each Lenders Term Loan Commitment shall terminate immediately and without further action upon the making of the Term Loan on the Closing Date in the amount of such Lenders Term Loan Commitment in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
(b)                              The Administrative Borrower shall give the Agent prior written notice in substantially the form of Exhibit I hereto (a Notice of Borrowing), not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the Closing Date (or with respect to any Incremental Term Loan, on the date on which such Incremental Term Loan is requested to be made). Such Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the principal amount of the Term Loan or Incremental Term Loan requested, (ii) whether the Term Loan or Incremental Term Loan is requested to be Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Loan, and if a LIBOR Loan, the Interest Period applicable thereto, and (iii) wire transfer instructions pursuant to which the proceeds of the Term Loan or Incremental Term Loan should be disbursed.  Agent and the Lenders may act without liability upon the basis of such Notice of Borrowing believed by Agent in good faith to be from the Administrative Borrower. The Agent and the Lenders shall have no duty to verify the authenticity of the signature appearing on any written Notice of Borrowing.
 
1





 
(b)                              Each Lender shall make its Term Loan Commitment available to Agent, in immediately available funds, in the Agents Account no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Closing Date (or with respect to any Incremental Term Loan, on the date on which such Incremental Term Loan is requested to be made). Upon receipt of all amounts requested in the Notice of Borrowing, the Agent will make the proceeds of such Term Loan available to the Borrowers on the day of the proposed Term Loan by causing said amount, in immediately available funds, to be deposited in the account or accounts designated by the Administrative Borrower.
 
2.2.                        Incremental Facility Loans.
 
(a)                               Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein the Lenders agree that the Borrowers may, on any Business Day from time to time after the Closing Date and before the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, deliver a written notice to Agent (an Incremental Request) at least 15 Business Days (or such shorter period as Agent may agree in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed borrowing date requesting to add additional term loans (the Incremental Term Loans; and each credit facility for making any Incremental Term Loans is an Incremental Facility) up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the Available Increase Amount, provided that, (i) immediately prior to and immediately after giving effect to any Incremental Facility Amendment and the closing of such Incremental Facility, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, (ii) immediately prior to and immediately after giving effect to any Incremental Facility Amendment and the closing of such Incremental Facility, the representations and warranties of each Borrower and each other Loan Party contained in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof) on and as of the date such Incremental Term Loans are advanced, as though made on and as of such date (except to the extent that such representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date), (iii) immediately prior to and immediately after giving effect to any Incremental Facility Amendment and the closing of such Incremental Facility, the Loan Parties shall be in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants set forth in Section 8 (after giving effect to the related use of proceeds)  as of the last day of the immediately preceding Fi

25x and (y) 3.00 to 1.00, (v) the final stated maturity date for any Incremental Term Loan shall be no earlier than the Maturity Date, (vi) the weighted average life to maturity applicable to each Incremental Facility shall be no shorter than weighted average life to maturity of the Term Loan, (vii) the aggregate principal amount of all Incremental Term Loans shall not exceed $50,000,000, (viii) each Incremental Facility shall be in a principal amount of at least $10,000,000 and integral multiples of $5,000,000 in excess thereof and (ix) no more than four (4) Incremental Requests may be delivered during the term of this Agreement.
 
(b)                              The existing Lenders shall have the right to, but shall not be obligated to, participate in any Incremental Facility in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.  If one or more existing Lenders decline participation in any Incremental Facility (any Lender who does not respond within 15 Business Days to a request by Agent or Borrowers shall be deemed to have declined), any existing Lenders who have elected to participate in such Incremental Facility shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such declined portion in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares (ignoring, for the purpose of calculating such Pro Rata Shares, the portion of the Term Loan held by any
 
2





 
existing Lender who has elected not to participate).  Agent or the Borrowers may seek one or more new financial institutions (each of which must qualify as an assignee pursuant to Section 14) to be added as Lenders for purposes of participating in any remaining portion of any Incremental Facility declined by the existing Lenders (with allocations among such new Lenders to be determined by the Agent and the Borrowers).
 
(c)                               The interest rates, original issue discount, and initial fees for any Incremental Term Loans (collectively referred to herein as the yield therefor) shall be determined mutually by the Borrowers and the Lenders providing the applicable Incremental Term Loans; provided, that anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, if the yield that is applicable to any Incremental Term Loan is more than 0.50% higher than the corresponding yield applicable to the other outstanding Term Loan hereunder immediately prior to the effectiveness of the applicable Incremental Facility (the amount by which the yield is higher, less 0.50%, the Excess), then the yield applicable to the other outstanding Term Loan hereunder immediately prior to the effectiveness of such Incremental Facility shall be increased by the amount of the Excess, effective on the date such Incremental Term Loan is made, and without the necessity of any action by any party hereto.  In determining the applicable yield for purposes of the foregoing: (w) original issue discount or upfront fees paid by the Borrowers in connection with any Incremental Facility or the Term Loan (based on a four (4) year average life to maturity or lesser remaining life to maturity) shall be included, (x) any amendments to the rates of interest applicable to the other outstanding Term Loan that became effective subsequent to the Closing Date but prior to the time of such Incremental Facility shall be included, (y) arrangement, commitment, structuring and underwriting fees and any amendment fees paid or payable to the Agent (or its affiliates) in its capacity as such in connection with any of the other outstanding Term Loan or to one or more arrangers (or their affiliates) in their capacities as such applicable to any Incremental Facility shall be excluded and (z) if the Incremental Facility includes any interest rate floor greater than that applicable to the other outstanding Term Loan and such floor is greater than the floor applicable to the other outstanding Term Loan on the date of determination such excess amount shall be equated to interest margin for determining the increase.  Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 2.2, any Incremental Term Loans shall be on terms and pursuant to documentation to be determined by the Borrowers and the Lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans; provided that, to the extent such terms and documentation relating to the Incremental Term Loans are not consistent with the other outstanding Term Loan (except to the extent permitted above with respect to the interest rate and maturity date and below with respect to mandatory prepayments), they shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.
 
(d)                              Incremental Facilities shall rank pari passu in right of payment and pari passu with respect to security with the other Term Loan.  Incremental Facilities shall share ratably in any prepayments of the other outstanding Term Loans unless the Borrowers and the Lenders in respect of the Incremental Facilities elect less than a ratable share of such prepayments.
 
(e)                               The proceeds of any Incremental Facility may be used by the Borrowers solely for the financing of Acquisitions permitted hereunder; provided, that the proceeds of any Incremental Facility shall not be used to acquire any Affiliate of Equity Sponsor.
 
(f)                                Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 2.2, no Lender shall be obligated to provide any Incremental Facility.
 
(g)                               Unless otherwise specifically provided herein or in the applicable Incremental Facility Amendment, all references in this Agreement and any other Loan Document to the Term Loan shall be deemed, unless the context otherwise requires, to include any Incremental Term Loan made pursuant to this Section 2.2.  The Term Loan, including any such Incremental Term Loan established pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall constitute the Term Loan under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits
 
3





 
afforded by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from any guarantees and the security interests created by the Loan Documents.  Borrowers shall take any actions reasonably required by Agent to ensure and demonstrate that the Liens and security interests granted by the Loan Documents continue to be perfected under the Code or otherwise after giving effect to the establishment of any such Incremental Term Loan, subject to the exceptions and limitations contained in, and to the extent required by, the Loan Documents.
 
(h)                              Each Incremental Facility shall be evidenced by an amendment (an Incremental Facility Amendment) to this Agreement, giving effect only to the modifications required to implement such Incremental Facility as permitted by this Section 2.2 (and subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 2.2), executed by Borrowers, the Guarantors, Agent and each Lender (including any new Lender, if any) providing a portion of the Incremental Facility; which such amendment, when so executed, shall amend this Agreement as provided therein.  The implementation of an Incremental Facility may also require amendments to the other Loan Documents, and such other new Loan Documents, as Agent deems necessary or appropriate to effect the modifications permitted by this Section 2.2.  Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with any Incremental Facility Amendment, the respective Loan Parties shall (at their expense) amend (and the Agent is hereby directed to amend) any mortgage securing the Obligations that has a stated maximum amount of loans secured thereby less than the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan after giving effect to such Incremental Facility Amendment so that such stated maximum amount of loans secured thereby is increased to reflect the increase contemplated by the applicable Incremental Facility Amendment (or such different amount as may be advised by local counsel to the Agent).  The Borrowers agree to pay the reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent relating to any Incremental Facility Amendment and the transactions contemplated thereby.  Neither the applicable Incremental Facility Amendment, nor any such amendments to the other Loan Documents or such other new Loan Documents, shall be required to be executed or approved by any Lender, other than any Lender providing a portion of the Incremental Facility and the Agent, in order to be effective.  The effectiveness of any Incremental Facility Amendment shall be subject to, among other things, the satisfaction on the date thereof of each of the conditions set forth in this Section 2.2, and, except as otherwise specified in the applicable Incremental Facility Amendment, Agent shall have received customary legal opinions as to matters reasonably requested, board resolutions and other customary closing documents and certificates reasonably requested by Agent in connection therewith.
 
2.3.                        LIBOR Option.
 
(a)                               The Borrowers may, at any time and from time to time, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, elect to have interest on all or a portion of the Loans be charged at a rate of interest based upon the LIBOR Rate (the LIBOR Option) by notifying the Agent in writing prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) at least 3 Business Days prior to (i) the commencement of the proposed Interest Period or (ii) in the case of the conversion of a LIBOR Loan into a Base Rate Loan, by 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) at least 1 Business Day prior to the last day of the then current Interest Period (the LIBOR Deadline).  Notice of the Borrowers election of the LIBOR Option for a permitted portion of the Loans and an Interest Period pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) shall be made by delivery by Administrative Borrower to the Agent of a LIBOR Notice received by the Agent before the LIBOR Deadline.  Promptly upon its receipt of each such LIBOR Notice, the Agent shall provide a copy thereof to each of the Lenders.  Each LIBOR Notice shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrowers.
 
(b)                              Interest on LIBOR Loans shall be payable in accordance with Section 2.6.  On the last day of each applicable Interest Period, unless the Borrowers properly have exercised the LIBOR Option with respect thereto, the interest rate applicable to such LIBOR Loans automatically shall convert to the rate of interest then applicable to Base Rate Loans of the same type hereunder.  At any time that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrowers no longer shall have the option to request
 
4





 
that any portion of the Loans bear interest at the LIBOR Rate and the Agent shall have the right to convert the interest rate on all outstanding LIBOR Loans to the rate of interest then applicable to Base Rate Loans of the same type hereunder on the last day of the then current Interest Period.
 
(c)                               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Borrowers (i) shall have not more than eight (8) LIBOR Loans in effect at any given time, and (ii) only may exercise the LIBOR Option for LIBOR Loans of at least $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof.
 
(d)                              The Borrowers may prepay LIBOR Loans at any time; provided, however, that in the event that LIBOR Loans are prepaid on any date that is not the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, including as a result of any mandatory prepayment pursuant or any application of payments or proceeds of Collateral, or for any other reason, including early termination of the term of this Agreement or acceleration of all or any portion of the Obligations pursuant to the terms hereof, the Borrowers shall indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and Lenders and their participants harmless against any and all Funding Losses in accordance with Section 2.3(f).
 
(e)                               Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither Agent nor any Lender, nor any of their participants, is required actually to acquire eurodollar deposits to fund or otherwise match fund any Obligation as to which interest accrues at the LIBOR Rate.  The provisions of this Agreement shall apply as if each Lender or its participants had match funded any Obligation as to which interest is accruing at the LIBOR Rate by acquiring eurodollar deposits for each Interest Period in the amount of the LIBOR Loans.
 
(f)                                In connection with each LIBOR Loan, the Borrowers shall indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and the Lenders harmless against any loss, cost, or expense incurred by Agent or any Lender as a result of (a) the payment of any principal of any LIBOR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or any mandatory prepayment required pursuant to Section 2.4(d)), (b) the conversion of any LIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), or (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBOR Loan on the date specified in any Notice of Borrowing or LIBOR Notice delivered pursuant hereto (such losses, costs, and expenses, collectively, Funding Losses), provided that in no event shall Funding Losses include any loss of anticipated profits.  Funding Losses shall be paid by Borrowers directly to the applicable Agent or Lender, and with respect to any Agent or any Lender, be deemed to equal the amount reasonably determined by such Agent or such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such LIBOR Loan had such event not occurred, at the LIBOR Rate that would have been applicable thereto (but disregarding clause (b) of the definition thereof), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period therefor), minus (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Agent or such Lender would be offered were it to be offered, at the commencement of such period, Dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period in the London interbank market.  A certificate of an Agent or a Lender delivered to the Administrative Borrower setting forth any amount or amounts that such Agent or such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.3(f) (and a reasonably detailed calculation thereof) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
2.4.                        Payments; Prepayments.
 
(a)                               Payments by Borrowers.  The Borrowers will make each payment under this Agreement not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the day when due, in lawful money of the
 
5





 
United States of America and in immediately available funds, to Agents Account.  All payments received by Agent after 12:00 noon (New York City time) on any Business Day may be credited (solely for purposes of calculating interest hereunder) to the Loan Account on the next succeeding Business Day.  All payments shall be made by the Borrowers without set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction or other defense to Agent and Lenders.  After receipt, Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal ratably to the applicable Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Share of the Term Loan and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, provided that Agent will cause to be distributed all interest and fees received from or for the account of the Borrowers not less than once each month and in any event promptly after receipt thereof.  Whenever any payment to be made under any such Loan Document shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest.
 
(b)                              Scheduled Amortization Payments.  The principal amount of the Term Loan shall be paid in installments (all such installment payments, collectively, the Scheduled Term Loan Installment Payments) on the dates shown below in an amount equal to the product of (i) the percentage set forth in Column B below shown opposite each date as set forth in Column A below times (ii) the sum of (x) the original principal amount of the Term Loan made on the Closing Date plus (y) except as otherwise provided in any applicable Incremental Facility Amendment, commencing on the last Business Day of the Fiscal Quarter in

The   remaining principal balance of the Term Loan   
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other Obligations accrued and unpaid, shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date.
 
(c)                               Optional Prepayments.  At any time and from time to time, upon at least 3 days prior written notice to the Agent (or such shorter period consented to by the Agent), and subject to Section 2.3(d) in the case of LIBOR Loans, the Borrowers may prepay the principal of the Loans in whole or in part and ratably in accordance with each Lenders Pro Rata Share as to the Loans being prepaid.  Each prepayment made pursuant to this clause (c) shall be accompanied by the payment of (A) accrued interest to the date of such payment and (B) the Applicable Prepayment Premium.  Each such prepayment shall be applied against the remaining installments of principal due on the Term Loan on a pro rata basis.
 
(d)                              Mandatory Prepayments. Subject to the ABL Credit Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement (and without duplication):
 
(i)                                  Upon the issuance or incurrence by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness), or upon an Equity Issuance by Parent (other than Excluded Equity Issuances), in each case, after the Closing Date, the Borrowers shall prepay the outstanding amount of the Loans in accordance with clause (e) below in an amount equal to (A) 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received by such Person in connection therewith, plus (B) the Applicable Prepayment Premium.  The provisions of this Section 2.4(d)(i) shall not be deemed to be implied consent to any such issuance, incurrence or sale otherwise prohibited by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
 
(ii)                              On or prior to the date audited annual financial statements are required to be delivered to Agent pursuant to Section 6.1, commencing with the financial statements for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2017, the Borrowers shall prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans in accordance with clause (e) below in an amount equal to the result of (A) the ECF Percentage of the Excess Cash Flow of Parent and its Subsidiaries for such Fiscal Year minus (B) the aggregate amount of all optional principal payments on the Loans that were made during such Fiscal Year pursuant to Section 2.4(c) and any Applicable Prepayment Premium paid during such Fiscal Year in connection therewith, such amount not to be less than zero.
 
(iii)                          Upon the receipt by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any Extraordinary Receipts (but only, unless the ABL Obligations have been paid in full, to the extent constituting Term Priority Collateral), the Borrowers shall, no later than three Business Days following receipt thereof, prepay the outstanding principal of the Loans in accordance with clause (e) below in an amount equal to 100% of such Extraordinary Receipts (net of any expenses incurred in collecting such
 
7





 
Extraordinary Receipts or otherwise in connection therewith and any taxes payable or estimated by Borrowers in good faith to be payable by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection therewith) (Net Extraordinary Receipts), to the extent that the aggregate amount of Net Extraordinary Receipts received by all Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries exceeds $250,000 in any Fiscal Year (or, in the case of the Fiscal Year ending December 31, 2016, during the period commencing with the day after the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2016).
 
(iv)                          Upon any Disposition by any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries described in clause (a), (g) or (h) of the definition of Permitted Dispositions (but only, unless the ABL Obligations have been paid in full, to the extent resulting from a Disposition of Term Priority Collateral), the Borrowers shall, no later than three Business Days following receipt thereof, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans in accordance with clause (e) below in an amount equal to (A) 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received by such Person in connection with such Disposition, to the extent that the aggregate amount of Net Cash Proceeds received by all Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries (and not paid to the Lenders as a prepayment of the Loans in accordance herewith) shall exceed for all such Dispositions $250,000 in any Fiscal Year (or, in the case of the Fiscal Year ending December 31, 2016, during the period commencing with the day after the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2016), plus (B) except in connection with any prepayment in connection with a Disposition pursuant to clause (g) of the definition of Permitted Dispositions, the Applicable Prepayment Premium.  Nothing contained in this Section 2.4(d)(iv) shall permit any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries to make a Disposition of any property other than in accordance with Section 7.4.
 
(v)                              If a Change of Control occurs, the Borrowers shall immediately prepay the entire outstanding principal amount of the Loans, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, all other Obligations accrued and unpaid and the Applicable Prepayment Premium.
 
(vi)                          Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Net Cash Proceeds received by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with a Disposition or the receipt of Extraordinary Receipts consisting of insurance proceeds or condemnation awards that are required to be used to prepay the Loans pursuant to Section 2.4(d)(iii) or Section 2.4(d)(iv), as the case may be, an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds and Extraordinary Receipts shall not be required to be so used to prepay the Loans to the extent that an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds and Net Extraordinary Receipts are used to replace, repair or restore properties or assets used in or are reinvested in assets usable in the business of the Loan Parties, provided that, (A) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date such Person receives such Net Cash Proceeds or Extraordinary Receipts, (B) the Administrative Borrower delivers a certificate to Agent within 30 days after such Disposition or receipt of such Extraordinary Receipts, as the case may be, stating that an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds or Net Extraordinary Receipts shall be used to replace, repair, restore or reinvest in properties or other assets used or usable in the business of the Loan Parties within a period specified in such certificate not to exceed 180 days (which period shall be extended to 365 days in the event a binding letter of intent is entered into within such 180-day period) after the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds or Extraordinary Receipts (which certificate shall set forth estimates of the Net Cash Proceeds or Net Extraordinary Receipts to be so expended), (C) pending usage, such Net Cash Proceeds or Net Extraordinary Receipts are deposited in an account subject to a Control Agreement, and (D) upon the earlier of (1) the expiration of the period specified in the relevant certificate furnished to Agent pursuant to clause (B) above or (2) the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds or Net Extraordinary Receipts, if not theretofore so used, may, at the direction of Agent, be used to prepay the Loans in accordance with Section 2.4(d)(iii) or (iv), as applicable.
 
(vii)                      Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary contained in this Section 2.4(d), it is agreed and understood that (a) until the ABL Obligations have been paid in full, the
 
8





 
Net Cash Proceeds of a Disposition of ABL Priority Collateral, or any Extraordinary Receipts consisting of insurance recoveries or condemnation awards that are direct proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral, shall not be subject to the prepayment requirements of this Section 2.4(d), and (b) the mandatory prepayment provisions set forth in this Section 2.4(d) shall be subject to, and superseded by, any applicable provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.
 
(viii)                  The Administrative Borrower shall provide written notice of any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.4(d) when paid, which notice shall state pursuant to which clause of this Section 2.4(d) the prepayment is being made.
 
(e)                               Application and Apportionment of Payments.
 
(i)                                  Subject to the terms of Section 2.4(e)(ii) below, each prepayment made by the Borrowers pursuant to subsections (c) or (d) above shall be applied to the remaining installments of principal of the Term Loan on a pro rata basis.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, prepayments required under Section 2.4(c) and (d) shall be applied in the manner set forth in Section 2.4(e)(ii) below.
 
(ii)                              Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and any prior application required by the ABL Lender under the ABL Credit Agreement, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Agent may, and upon the direction of the Required Lenders shall, apply all proceeds of the Collateral and any other payments received by Agent, (I) first, ratably to pay the Obligations in respect of any fees, cost and expense reimbursements, indemnities and other amounts then due and payable to the Agent until paid in full; (II) second, ratably to pay interest then due and payable in respect of the Agent Advances until paid in full; (III) third, ratably to pay principal of the Agent Advances until paid in full; (IV) fourth, ratably to pay any fees, costs, expenses and indemnities in respect of the Obligations then due and payable to the Lenders until paid in full; (V) fifth, ratably to pay interest then due and payable in respect of the Obligations until paid in full; (VI) sixth, ratably to pay principal of the Loans until paid in full; and (VII) seventh, to the ratable payment of all other Obligations applicable to any Loan Party then due and payable until paid in full.
 
(iii)                          For the avoidance of doubt, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and Agent has elected to or has been directed by the Required Lenders to apply payments in respect of any Obligations and all proceeds of the Collateral in accordance with Section 2.4(e)(ii), Section 2.4(e)(ii) shall not be deemed to apply to any payment by the Borrowers specified by the Administrative Borrower to Agent to be for the payment of Obligations then due and payable under any provision of this Agreement or the prepayment of all or part of the principal of the Loan in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 2.4(c).
 
(iv)                          All payments of principal and interest in respect of outstanding Loans, all payments of fees (other than the fees set forth in Section 2.11 hereof), and all other payments in respect of any other Obligations, shall be allocated by Agent among such of the Lenders as are entitled thereto, in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares or otherwise as provided herein or, in respect of payments not made on account of the Loans, as designated by the Person making payment when the payment is made.
 
(f)                                Crediting Payments. For purposes of calculating the accrual of interest on outstanding Obligations, each payment shall be applied to the applicable Obligations as of the Business Day of receipt of immediately available funds by Agent; provided that all payments received by Agent after 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on any Business Day will be credited (solely for purposes of
 
9





 
calculating interest) to the Obligations on the next succeeding Business Day. Any payment received by Agent that is not a transfer of immediately available funds shall be considered provisional until the item or items representing such payment have been finally paid under applicable law. Should any payment item not be honored when presented for payment, then Borrowers shall be deemed not to have made such payment, and that portion of Borrowers outstanding Obligations corresponding to the amount of such dishonored payment item shall be deemed to bear interest as if the dishonored payment item had never been received by Agent.
 
(g)                               Sharing of Payments.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein that a payment is to be made for the account of an individual Lender, if any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of any Obligation in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of similar obligations obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in such similar obligations held by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that (a) if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lenders ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lenders required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender of any interest or other amount paid by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered) and (b) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (i) any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), or (ii) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans.  The Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.4(g) may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all of its rights (including the Lenders right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation.
 
2.5.                        Defaulting Lenders.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
 
(a)                               Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be restricted as set forth in Section 15.
 
(b)                              It is agreed and understood that Agent shall be entitled to set off any funding shortfall of a Defaulting Lender against such Defaulting Lenders respective Pro Rata Share of any payments received by Agent pursuant to the terms hereof.  Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to such Defaulting Lender any payments made by or for the account of any Borrower to Agent for such Defaulting Lenders benefit (unless and until any outstanding funding shortfall of such Defaulting Lender has been cured, including by way of an exercise of the set off rights provided for in the immediately preceding sentence), and, in the absence of such transfer to such Defaulting Lender, Agent shall transfer any such payments to each other non-Defaulting Lender ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares (without giving effect to the Pro Rata Shares of such Defaulting Lender) (but only to the extent that such Defaulting Lenders Loans were funded by the other Lenders and such payments have not been used to set off any outstanding funding shortfall of such Defaulting Lender) or, if so directed by the Administrative Borrower and if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (and to the extent such Defaulting Lenders Loans were not funded by the other Lenders and any funding shortfall of such Defaulting Lender has otherwise not been cured), retain the same to be re-advanced to the Borrowers as if
 
10

 




 
such Defaulting Lender had made such Loans to the Borrowers.  Subject to the foregoing, Agent may hold and, in its discretion, re-lend to the Borrowers for the account of such Defaulting Lender the amount of all such payments received and retained by Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender.
 
(c)                               Any such failure to fund by any Defaulting Lender shall constitute a material breach by such Defaulting Lender of this Agreement and shall entitle (but not obligate) the Borrowers to replace the Defaulting Lender with one or more substitute Lenders reasonably acceptable to the Agent, and the Defaulting Lender shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder.  Such notice to replace the Defaulting Lender shall specify an effective date for such replacement, which date shall not be later than 15 Business Days after the date such notice is given.  Prior to the effective date of such replacement, the Defaulting Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance, subject only to the Defaulting Lender being repaid its share of the outstanding Obligations without any premium or penalty of any kind whatsoever.  If the Defaulting Lender shall refuse or fail to execute and deliver any such Assignment and Acceptance prior to the effective date of such replacement, the Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance.  The replacement of any Defaulting Lender shall be made in accordance with the terms of Section 14.
 
(d)                              The operation of this Section 2.5 shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Term Loan Commitment of any Lender, to relieve or excuse the performance by a Defaulting Lender or any other Lender of its duties and obligations hereunder, or to relieve or excuse the performance by any Borrower of its duties and obligations hereunder to Agent or to the Lenders other than such Defaulting Lender.
 
(e)                               Other than as expressly set forth in this Section 2.5, the rights and obligations of a Defaulting Lender (including the obligation to indemnify Agent) and the other parties hereto shall remain unchanged.  Nothing in this Section 2.5 shall be deemed to release any Defaulting Lender from its obligations under this Agreement and the Loan Documents, shall alter such obligations, shall operate as a waiver of any default by such Defaulting Lender hereunder, or shall prejudice any rights which any Borrower, Agent or any Lender may have against any Defaulting Lender as a result of any default by such Defaulting Lender hereunder.
 
(f)                                This Section 2.5 shall remain effective with respect to any Defaulting Lenders until either (i) the Obligations under this Agreement shall have been declared or shall have become immediately due and payable or (ii) the non-Defaulting Lenders, Agent, and the Borrowers shall have waived such Defaulting Lenders default in writing, and the Defaulting Lender makes its Pro Rata Share of the applicable defaulted Loans and pays to Agent all amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender in respect thereof; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided further that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
2.6.                        Interest Rates: Rates, Payments, and Calculations.
 
(a)                               Interest Rates.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, at the option of the Administrative Borrower, each Loan or any portion thereof shall be either a Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Loan.  Each portion of a Loan that is a Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the principal amount thereof from time to time outstanding, from the date of the Loan until repaid, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.  Each portion of a Loan that is a LIBOR Loan shall bear interest on the principal amount thereof from time to time outstanding, from the date of the Loan until repaid, at a
 
11





 
rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Loan (or such portion thereof) plus the Applicable Margin.
 
(b)                              Default Rate.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default and at any time following the Maturity Date, in each case at the election of Agent (or at the direction of Required Lenders) by notice to the Administrative Borrower (which notice may be revoked by Agent at its option (provided, that if an election to increase the interest rate as set forth in this paragraph is made at the direction of Required Lenders, then such revocation shall be made only at the direction of Required Lenders)), the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to two (2) percentage points above the per annum rate otherwise applicable thereto hereunder.  For avoidance of doubt, Agent may assess such default rate commencing on the date of the occurrence of an Event of Default irrespective of the date of reporting or declaration of such Event of Default.
 
(c)                               Payment.  Interest on each Base Rate Loan shall be payable monthly, in arrears, on the first day of each month, commencing on the first day of the month following the month in which such Loan is made, upon any prepayment of such Loan in accordance with Section 2.4, and at maturity (whether upon demand, by acceleration or otherwise).  Interest on each LIBOR Loan shall be payable on the last day of each Interest Period relating to such Loan (and, in the case of a LIBOR Loan with an Interest Period in excess of 3 months, on the last day of each 3-month interval of such Interest Period), commencing on the first day of the month following the month in which such Loan is made, upon any prepayment of such Loan in accordance with Section 2.4, and at maturity (whether upon demand, by accel

wise).  Default interest payable pursuant to Section 2.6(b) shall be payable on demand.  Any interest, fees, costs, expenses, or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document that are not paid as and when due and payable shall accrue interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans.
 
(d)                              Computation.  All interest shall be computed for the actual number of days, including the first day but excluding the last day, elapsed on the basis of (i) a year of 360 days for interest calculated based on the LIBOR Rate or (ii) a year of 365/366 days for interest calculated based on the Base Rate.
 
(e)                               Intent to Limit Charges to Maximum Lawful Rate.  In no event shall the interest  rate or rates payable under this Agreement, plus any other amounts paid in connection herewith, exceed the highest rate permissible under any law that a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable.  Borrowers, Agent and Lenders, in executing and delivering this Agreement, intend legally to agree upon the rate or rates of interest and manner of payment stated within it; provided, however, that, anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if said rate or rates of interest or manner of payment exceeds the maximum allowable under applicable law, then, as of the date of this Agreement, Borrowers are and shall be liable only for the payment of such maximum amount as is allowed by law, and payment received from Borrowers in excess of such legal maximum, whenever received, shall be applied to reduce the principal balance of the Obligations to the extent of such excess.
 
2.7.                        [Reserved].
 
2.8.                        Maintenance of Loan Account; Statements of Obligations. Agent shall maintain an account on its books in the name of Borrowers (the Loan Account) in which will be recorded all Loans and other advances made by Agent and Lenders to Borrowers or for Borrowers account and all other payment Obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, including accrued interest, fees and expenses.  In accordance with Section 2.4 and Section 2.6, the Loan Account will be credited with all payments received by Agent from Borrowers or for Borrowers account.  Within 1 Business Day after any
 
12





 
activity on the Loan Account, Agent shall deliver to Administrative Borrower, or make available to Administrative Borrower electronically, statements regarding the Loan Account, including with respect to principal, interest, fees, and including an itemization of all charges and expenses owing, and such statements shall be subject to subsequent adjustment by Agent as provided in this Agreement upon notice to Borrowers but shall, absent manifest error, be conclusively presumed to be correct and accurate and constitute an account stated between Borrowers on the one hand and Agent and Lenders on the other unless, within 30 days after receipt thereof by Borrowers, Borrowers shall deliver to Agent written objection thereto describing the error or errors contained in any such statements.

2.10.                Effect of Maturity; Releases.
 
(a)                               On the Maturity Date, all obligations of Agent and Lenders hereunder shall automatically be terminated and all of the Obligations shall immediately become due and payable without notice or demand and Borrowers shall immediately repay all of such Obligations in full.  No termination of the obligations of Agent and Lenders (other than cash payment in full of the Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations not yet accrued and payable)) shall relieve or discharge any Loan Party of its duties, obligations, or covenants hereunder or under any other Loan Document and Agents Liens in the Collateral shall continue to secure the Obligations and shall remain in effect until all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations not yet accrued and payable) have been paid in full in cash and Agents and Lenders obligations to provide additional credit hereunder shall have been terminated.  Agent shall, at Borrowers expense, release or terminate any filings or other agreements that perfect the Agents Liens in the Collateral, upon Agents receipt of each of the following: (i) cash payment in full of all Obligations in good and available funds, (ii) evidence that any obligation of Agent and Lenders to provide any further credit to any Borrower hereunder has been terminated, and (iii) an agreement by each Borrower and each Guarantor to indemnify Agent and Lenders and each of their Affiliates for any payments received by Agent or its Affiliates that are applied to the Obligations as a final payoff that may subsequently be returned or otherwise not paid for any reason.
 
(b)                              If any of the Collateral shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by any Loan Party to a Person that is not a Loan Party in a transaction expressly permitted by this Agreement, then such Collateral shall be automatically released from the Liens created by the Loan Documents without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any party, and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to such Loan Party or its transferee, as the case may be, and Agent, at the request of Administrative Borrower and the sole expense of such Loan Party, shall execute and deliver to such Loan Party all releases or other documents reasonably necessary to evidence the release of the Liens created by the Loan Documents on such Collateral.  In the event that all of the Stock of a Loan Party shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of to a Person that is not a Loan Party in a transaction that is expressly permitted by this Agreement, then at the request of Administrative Borrower and the sole expense of Borrowers, Agent shall release such Loan Party from its obligations under the Loan Documents and shall execute and deliver to such Loan Party all releases or other documentation reasonably necessary to evidence such release.

13





 
any Person controlling Agent or such Lender to any duty or other charge with respect to this Agreement or any Loan made by Agent or such Lender, (ii) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against any Loan or against assets of or held by, or deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, Agent or such Lender or any Person controlling Agent or such Lender or (iii) impose on Agent or such Lender or any Person controlling such Agent or such Lender any other condition regarding this Agreement or any Loan, and the result of any event referred to in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above shall be to increase the cost to Agent or such Lender of making any Loan, or agreeing to make any Loan, or to reduce any amount received or receivable by Agent or such Lender hereunder, then, promptly (and in any event within 3 days) following demand by Agent or such Lender, the Borrowers shall pay to Agent or such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate Agent or such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amount.
 
(b)                              If Agent or any Lender shall have determined that any Change in Law either (i) affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by Agent or such Lender or any Person controlling Agent or such Lender, and Agent or such Lender determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a direct or indirect consequence of any Loan made or maintained, Agents or such Lenders or such other controlling Persons other obligations hereunder, or (ii) has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on Agents or such Lenders such other controlling Persons capital to a level below that which Agent or such Lender or such controlling Person could have achieved but for such circumstances as a consequence of any Loan made or maintained, or any agreement to make any Loan, or Agents or such Lenders or such other controlling Persons other obligations hereunder (in each case, taking into consideration, Agents or such Lenders or such other controlling Persons policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, promptly (and in any event within 3 days) following demand by Agent or such Lender, the Borrowers shall pay to Agent or such Lender from time to time such additional amounts as will compensate Agent or such Lender for such cost of maintaining such increased capital or such reduction in the rate of return on Agents or such Lenders or such other controlling Persons capital.
 
(c)                               All amounts payable under this Section 2.12 shall bear interest from the date that is 10 days after the date of demand by Agent or any Lender (accompanied by reasonable back-up documentation therefor) until payment in full to Agent or such Lender at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.  A certificate of Agent or such Lender claiming compensation under this Section 2.12, specifying the event herein above described and the nature of such event shall be submitted by Agent or such Lender to the Administrative Borrower, setting forth the additional amount due and a reasonably detailed explanation of the calculation thereof, and Agents or such Lenders reasons for invoking the provisions of this Section 2.12, and shall be final and conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(d)                              Failure or delay on the part of Agent or any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.12 shall not constitute a waiver of Agents or such Lenders right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate Agent or any Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.12 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Administrative Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).  The determination by Lender of any amount due pursuant to this Section 2.12, as set forth in a certificate setting forth the calculation thereof in reasonable detail, shall, in the absence of manifest or demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto.

2.13.                Changes in Law; Impracticability or Illegality.
 
(a)                               The LIBOR Rate may be adjusted by Agent with respect to any Lender on a prospective basis to take into account any additional or increased costs to such Lender (other than Excluded Taxes or Taxes which are governed by Section 16 hereof) of maintaining or obtaining any eurodollar deposits or increased costs due to changes in applicable law occurring subsequent to the commencement of the then applicable Interest Period, including changes in tax laws (except changes of general applicability in corporate income tax laws) and changes in the reserve requirements imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor), excluding the Reserve Percentage, which additional or increased costs would increase the cost of funding loans bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate.  In any such event, the affected Lender shall give the Administrative Borrower and Agent written notice of such a determination and adjustment and Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and, upon its receipt of the notice from the affected Lender, the Administrative Borrower may, by notice to such affected Lender (i) require such Lender to furnish to the Administrative Borrower a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for adjusting such LIBOR Rate and the method for determining the amount of such adjustment, or (ii) repay the LIBOR Loans with respect to which such adjustment is made (together with any amounts due under Section 2.3(f)).
 
(b)                              In the event that any change in market conditions or any law, regulation, treaty, or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation of application thereof, shall at any time after the date hereof, in the reasonable opinion of any Lender, make it unlawful or impractical for such Lender to fund or maintain LIBOR Loans or to continue such funding or maintaining, or to determine or charge interest rates at the LIBOR Rate, such Lender shall give written notice of such changed circumstances to the Administrative Borrower and Agent, and Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and (i) in the case of any LIBOR Loans of such Lender that are outstanding, the date specified in such Lenders notice shall be deemed to be the last day of the Interest Period of such LIBOR Loans, and interest upon the LIBOR Loans of such Lender thereafter shall accrue interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder, and (ii) the Borrowers shall not be entitled to elect the LIBOR Option until such Lender determines that it would no longer be unlawful or impractical to do so.
 
(c)                               The obligations of the Loan Parties under this Section 2.13 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

15





 
(b)                              If any Lender requires a Borrower to pay any additional amounts under Section 16 or requests compensation under Section 2.12 or Section 2.13(a), or any Lender gives notice of the occurrence of circumstances described in Section 2.13(b), and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with clause (a) above, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Administrative Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 14), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an assignee that is reasonably acceptable to Agent that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if such Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:
 
(i)                                  the Borrowers shall have paid to Agent any assignment fees specified in Section 14;
 
(ii)                              Agent shall have received all documentation and other information required by regulatory authorities under applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the USA PATRIOT Act, for the assignee;

(iv)                          in the case of any such assignment resulting from payments required to be made pursuant to Section 16 or requests for compensation made under Section 2.12 or Section 2.13(a), such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
 
(v)                              such assignment does not conflict with applicable law.
 
Prior to the effective date of such assignment, the assigning Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance, subject only to the conditions set forth above.  If the assigning Lender shall refuse or fail to execute and deliver any such Assignment and Acceptance prior to the effective date of such assignment, the assigning Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance.  Any such assignment shall be made in accordance with the terms of Section 14.

(b)                              [Reserved.]
 
(c)                               Contribution. Each Borrower hereby agrees that it will not enforce any of its rights of contribution or subrogation against any other Borrower with respect to any liability incurred by it hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, any payments made by it to Agent or any Lender with respect to any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor until such time as all of the Obligations have been paid in full in cash.  Any claim which any Borrower may have against any other Borrower with respect to any payments to Agent or any Lender on behalf of another Borrower hereunder are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment, without limitation as to any increases in the Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full in cash of the Obligations and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding under the laws of any jurisdiction relating to any Borrower, its debts or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full in cash before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any other Borrower therefor.
 
(d)                              No Limitation on Liability. Nothing contained in this Section 2.15 shall limit the liability of any Borrower to pay any Obligations, whether arising from Loans made directly or indirectly to that Borrower or to any other Borrower and all accrued interest, fees, expenses and other related Obligations with respect thereto, for which each Borrower shall be primarily liable for all purposes hereunder.
 
2.16.                RG Parent LLC as Agent for Borrowers.  Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints RG Parent as the Administrative Borrower and attorney-in-fact for all Borrowers (the Administrative Borrower) which appointment shall remain in full force and effect unless and until Agent shall have received prior written notice signed by each Borrower that such appointment has been revoked and that another Borrower has been appointed Administrative Borrower.  Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Borrower (a) to provide Agent with all notices and instructions under this Agreement, and (b) to take such action as the Administrative Borrower deems appropriate on its behalf to direct the disbursement of the Term Loan and to exercise such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.  It is understood that the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral in a combined fashion, as more fully set forth herein, is done solely as an accommodation to Borrowers in order to utilize the collective borrowing powers of Borrowers in the most efficient and economical manner and at their request, and that neither Agent nor any Lender shall incur liability to any Borrower as a result hereof.  Each Borrower expects to derive benefit, directly or indirectly, from the handling of the Loan Account and the Collateral in a combined fashion since the successful operation of each Borrower is dependent on the continued successful performance of the integrated group.  To induce Agent and Lenders to do so, and in consideration thereof, each Borrower hereby jointly and severally agrees to indemnify Agent and each Lender and hold Agent and each Lender harmless against any and all liability, expense, loss or claim of damage or injury, made against Agent or any Lender by any Borrower or by any third party whosoever, arising from or incurred by reason of (a) the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral of Borrowers as herein provided, or (b) Agents or any Lenders reliance on any instructions of the Administrative Borrower, except that Borrowers will have no liability to Agent or any Lender under this Section 2.16 with respect to any
 
17





 
liability that has been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

3.2.                        Loan Parties Remain Liable.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (a) Borrowers and each other Loan Party shall remain liable under the contracts and agreements included in the Collateral to perform all of the duties and obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this Agreement had not been executed, (b) the exercise by Agent or any Lender of any of the rights hereunder shall not release any Borrower or any other Loan Party from any of its duties or obligations under such contracts and agreements included in the Collateral, and (c) neither Agent nor any Lender shall not have any obligation or liability under such contracts and agreements included in the Collateral by reason of the Security Interest, nor shall Agent or any Lender be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of any Borrower or any other Loan Party thereunder or to take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder.
 
3.3.                        Assignment of Insurance.  As additional security for the Obligations, each Loan Party hereby grants and pledges to Agent, for itself and for the benefit of each Lender, a lien and security interest in all rights of such Borrower and such Loan Party under (a) the Key Man Life Insurance Policy and (b) every policy of insurance covering the Collateral and all other assets and property of each Borrower and each other Loan Party (including, without limitation business interruption insurance and proceeds thereof) and all business records and other documents relating to it, and all monies (including proceeds and refunds) that may be payable under any such policy.  After the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, Agent may (but need not), in Agents or any Borrowers or any other Loan Partys name, and upon notice to Administrative Borrower, execute and deliver proofs of claim, receive payment of proceeds and endorse checks and other instruments representing payment of the policy of insurance, and adjust, litigate, compromise or release claims against the issuer of any policy.
 
3.4.                        Financing Statements.  Each Borrower and each other Loan Party authorizes Agent to file financing statements describing Collateral to perfect Agents Security Interest in the Collateral, and Agent may describe or indicate the Collateral as all assets of debtor, whether now owned or hereafter acquired or arising, together with all proceeds thereof or words of similar meaning.
 
3.5.                        Intercreditor Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, so long as the ABL Obligations remain outstanding, any provision hereof that requires any Loan Party to (a) deliver
 
18

All representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions and qualifications set forth in this Section 3.5.
 
4.                                    CONDITIONS.
 
4.1.                        Conditions Precedent to the making of the Term Loan.  The obligations of Lenders to make the Term Loan provided for hereunder on the Closing Date is subject to the fulfillment of the conditions precedent set forth on Exhibit B (the making of the Term Loan on the Closing Date by a Lender to be conclusive evidence of its satisfaction or waiver of such conditions precedent).
 
5.                                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.
 
In order to induce Agent and Lenders to enter into this Agreement, each Borrower and each other Loan Party makes the representations and warranties to Agent and Lenders set forth on Exhibit D.  Each of such representations and warranties shall be true, correct, and complete, in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof), as of the Closing Date, and shall be true, correct, and complete, in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof), as of the date of the making of each Incremental Term Loan made hereunder thereafter, as though made on and as of the date such Incremental Term Loan is made (except to the extent that such representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date) and such representations and warranties shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

(e)                               exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein, in the other Loan Documents, or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the Code or any other applicable law.
 
10.2.                Additional Rights and Remedies.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Loan Party expressly agrees that upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default:
 
(a)                               Agent, without demand of performance or other demand, advertisement or notice of any kind (except a notice specified below of time and place of public or private sale) to or upon any Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person (all and each of which demands, advertisements and notices are hereby expressly waived to the maximum extent permitted by the Code or any other applicable law), may, and at the direction of Required Lenders shall, take immediate possession of all or any portion of the Collateral and (i) require Loan Parties to, and each Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby agrees that it will at its own expense and upon request of Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by Agent and make it available to Agent at one or more locations designated by Agent where such Borrower or other Loan Party conducts business, and (ii) without notice except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of Agents or Loan Partys offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit, and upon such other terms as Agent may deem commercially reasonable.  Each Borrower and each other Loan Party agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least 10 days notice to such Borrower or such other Loan Party of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification and such notice shall constitute a reasonable authenticated notification of disposition within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the Code.  Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given.  Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time, and such sale may be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.  Each Borrower and each other Loan Party agrees that the internet shall constitute a place for purposes of Section 9-610(b) of the Code.  Each Borrower and each other Loan Party agrees that any sale of Collateral to a licensor pursuant to the terms of a license agreement between such licensor and such Borrower or such other Loan Party is sufficient to constitute a commercially reasonable sale (including as to method, terms, manner, and time) within the meaning of Section 9-610 of the Code;
 
(b)                              Agent may, and at the direction of Required Lenders shall, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein, in the other Loan Documents, or otherwise available to it under
 
39

(c)                               any cash held by Agent as Collateral and all cash proceeds received by Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied against the Obligations in the order set forth in Section 2.4(e).  In the event the proceeds of Collateral are insufficient to satisfy all of the Obligations in full, each Borrower and each other Loan Party shall remain jointly and severally liable for any such deficiency; and
 
(d)                              the Obligations arise out of a commercial transaction, and that if an Event of Default shall occur Agent shall have the right to an immediate writ of possession without notice of a hearing.  Agent shall have the right to the appointment of a receiver for each Loan Party or for the properties and assets of each Loan Party, and each Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby consents to such rights and such appointment and hereby waives any objection such Borrower or such Loan Party may have thereto or the right to have a bond or other security posted by Agent or Lenders.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in Section 10.1, upon the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default described in Section 9.5 or Section 9.6, in addition to the remedies set forth above, without any notice to any Borrower or any other Person or any act by Agent, all of the Obligations shall automatically and immediately become due and payable and each Borrower shall be obligated to repay all of such Obligations in full, without presentment, demand, protest, or notice of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by each Borrower.
 
10.3.                Agent Appointed Attorney in Fact.  Each Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby irrevocably appoints Agent its attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Borrower and such Loan Party and in the name of such Borrower or such Loan Party or otherwise, at such time as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to take any action and to execute any instrument which Agent may reasonably deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, including:
 
(a)                               to ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compromise, receive and give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become due under or in connection with the Accounts or any other Collateral of such Borrower or such other Loan Party;
 
(b)                              to receive, indorse, and collect any drafts or other instruments, documents, Negotiable Collateral or Chattel Paper;
 
(c)                               to file any claims or take any action or institute any proceedings which Agent may deem necessary or desirable for the collection of any of the Collateral of such Borrower or such other Loan Party or otherwise to enforce the rights of Agent and Lenders with respect to any of the Collateral;
 
40

(e)                               to use any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Licenses of such Borrower or such other Loan Party including but not limited to any labels, Patents, Trademarks, trade names, URLs, domain names, industrial designs, Copyrights, or advertising matter, in preparing for sale, advertising for sale, or selling Inventory or other Collateral and to collect any amounts due under Accounts, contracts or Negotiable Collateral of such Borrower or such other Loan Party;
 
(f)                                to take exclusive possession of all locations where each Borrower or other Loan Party conducts its business or has rights of possession, without notice to or consent of any Borrower or any Loan Party and to use such locations to store, process, manufacture, sell, use, and liquidate or otherwise dispose of items that are Collateral, without obligation to pay rent or other compensation for the possession or use of any location;
 
(g)                               Agent shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to bring suit in its own name or in the applicable Loan Partys name, to enforce the Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Licenses and, if Agent shall commence any such suit, the appropriate Borrower or such other Loan Party shall, at the request of Agent, do any and all lawful acts and execute any and all proper documents reasonably required by Agent in aid of such enforcement; and
 
(h)                              to the extent permitted by law, such Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby ratifies all that such attorney-in-fact shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.  This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable until all Obligations have been paid in full in cash.
 
10.4.                Remedies Cumulative.  The rights and remedies of Agent and Lenders under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and all other agreements shall be cumulative.  Agent and Lenders shall have all other rights and remedies not inconsistent herewith as provided under the Code, by law, or in equity.  No exercise by Agent or any Lender of one right or remedy shall be deemed an election, and no waiver by Agent or any Lender of any Default or Event of Default shall be deemed a continuing waiver.  No delay by Agent or any Lender shall constitute a waiver, election, or acquiescence by it.
 
10.5.                Crediting of Payments and Proceeds.  In the event that the Obligations have been accelerated pursuant to Section 10.1 or during an Event of Default the Agent has exercised any remedy set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, all payments received by Agent upon the Obligations and all net proceeds from the enforcement of the Obligations shall be applied, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, to the Obligations in accordance with Section 2.4(e)(ii) and, thereafter, to Borrowers or such other Person entitled thereto under applicable law.
 
10.6.                Marshaling.  Neither Agent nor any Lender shall be required to marshal any present or future collateral security (including but not limited to the Collateral) for, or other assurances of payment of, the Obligations or any of them or to resort to such collateral security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of Agents and Lenders rights and remedies under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents and in respect of such collateral security and other assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights and remedies, however existing or arising.  To the extent that it lawfully may, each Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby agrees that it will not invoke any law relating to the marshaling of collateral which might cause delay in or impede the enforcement of Agents and Lenders rights and remedies under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document or instrument creating or evidencing any of the Obligations or under which any of the Obligations is
 
41





 
outstanding or by which any of the Obligations is secured or payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to the extent that it lawfully may, each Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the benefits of all such laws.
 
10.7.                License.  Solely for the purpose of enabling Agent to exercise its rights and remedies hereunder, at such time as Agent is lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby grants to Agent a non-exclusive, worldwide license (without the payment of royalties to any Debtor) to use or otherwise exploit all Intellectual Property rights of such Borrower or such Loan Party for the purpose of: (a) completing the manufacture of any in-process materials while any Event of Default exists so that such materials become saleable Inventory, all in accordance with the same quality standards previously adopted by such Borrower or such other Loan Party for its own manufacturing; and (b) selling, leasing or otherwise disposing of any or all Collateral while any Event of Default exists; provided that such license shall be subject to the exclusive rights of any licensee under a license granted prior to such Event of Default, and (ii) the quality of any products or services in connection with which any Trademarks licensed hereunder are used will not be materially inferior to the quality of such services or products provided by such Borrower or such Loan Party under such Trademarks immediately prior to such Event of Default and such Borrower or such Loan Party shall have the right to inspect any such products and services to monitor compliance with such standard.
 
11.                            WAIVERS; INDEMNIFICATION.
 
11.1.                Demand; Protest; etc.  Each Borrower and each other Loan Party waives demand, protest, notice of protest, notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment and nonpayment, nonpayment at maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension, or renewal of documents, instruments, chattel paper, and guarantees at any time held by Agent on which such Borrower or such other Loan Party may in any way be liable.
 
11.2.                The Agents Liability for Collateral.  Each Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby agrees that:  (a) so long as Agent complies with its obligations, if any, under the Code, Agent shall not in any way or manner be liable or responsible for:  (i) the safekeeping of the Collateral, (ii) any loss or damage thereto occurring or arising in any manner or fashion from any cause, (iii) any diminution in the value thereof, or (iv) any act or default of any carrier, warehouseman, bailee, forwarding agency, or other Person, and (b) all risk of loss, damage, or destruction of the Collateral shall be borne by each Borrower and such other Loan Parties.
 
11.3.                Indemnification.  Each Borrower and each other Loan Party shall pay, indemnify, defend, and hold the Lender-Related Persons (each, an Indemnified Person) harmless (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law) from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, investigations, proceedings, liabilities, fines, costs, penalties, and damages, and all reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys, experts, or consultants and all other costs and expenses actually incurred and documented in connection therewith or in connection with the enforcement of this indemnification (as and when they are incurred and irrespective of whether suit is brought), at any time asserted against, imposed upon, or incurred by any of them (a) in connection with or as a result of or related to the execution and delivery, enforcement, performance, or administration (including any restructuring, forbearance or workout with respect hereto) of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the monitoring of compliance by each Borrower and each other Loan Party and each of its Subsidiaries with the terms of the Loan Documents, (b) with respect to any investigation, litigation, or proceeding related to this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or the use of the proceeds of the credit provided hereunder (irrespective of whether any Indemnified Person is a party thereto), or any act, omission, event, or circumstance in any manner related thereto, (c) in connection with the custody, preservation, use or operation of, or, while an Event of Default exists, the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any of the Collateral in accordance with this Agreement and the other
 
42

 




 
Loan Documents, (d) with respect to the failure by any Borrower or any other Loan Party to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof or any other Loan Document, (e) in connection with the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of Agent and Lenders hereunder or under any other Loan Document, and (f) in connection with or arising out of any presence or release of Hazardous Materials at, on, under, to or from any assets or properties owned, leased or operated by any Borrower or any other Loan Party or any Subsidiary of a Borrower or any other Loan Party or any Environmental Actions, Environmental Liabilities or Remedial Actions related in any way to any such assets or properties of such Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries (each and all of the foregoing, the Indemnified Liabilities).  The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, no Borrower or any other Loan Party shall have any obligation to any Indemnified Person under this Section 11.3 with respect to any Indemnified Liability that a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person or its officers, directors, employees, or attorneys.  This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment of the Obligations.  If any Indemnified Person makes any payment to any other Indemnified Person with respect to an Indemnified Liability as to which a Borrower or any other Loan Party was required to indemnify the Indemnified Person receiving such payment, the Indemnified Person making such payment is entitled to be indemnified and reimbursed by such Borrower or such other Loan Party with respect thereto.  WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY SHALL APPLY TO EACH INDEMNIFIED PERSON WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES WHICH IN WHOLE OR IN PART ARE CAUSED BY OR ARISE OUT OF ANY NEGLIGENT ACT OR OMISSION OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED PERSON OR OF ANY OTHER PERSON.

14.       ASSIGNMENTS; SUCCESSORS.
 
(a)        This Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Loan Party, Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that, except as permitted in Section 7.3(a), none of the Loan Parties may assign or transfer any of its rights hereunder or under the other Loan Documents without the prior written consent of each Lender and any such assignment without the Lenders prior written consent shall be null and void.
 
(b)        Each Lender may with the written consent of Agent (such consent of Agent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except in the case of a proposed assignment to any holder of Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated to the Obligations, in which case Agent may withhold
 
45





 
consent in its sole and absolute discretion) and the written consent of the Administrative Borrower (such consent of the Administrative Borrower not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall be deemed given if not denied in writing by the Administrative Borrower within 5 Business Days after receipt of written request therefor), assign to one or more other lenders or other entities all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to all or a portion of its Loans; provided, however, that (1) such assignment is in an amount which is at least $3,000,000 or a multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or such lesser amount as may be agreed to by Agent in its sole discretion) (except such minimum amount shall not apply to an assignment by a Lender to (x) a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or a Related Fund of such Lender or (y) a group of new Lenders, each of whom is an Affiliate or Related Fund of each other to the extent the aggregate amount to be assigned to all such new Lenders is at least $3,000,000 or a multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof), (2) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to Agent, for its acceptance, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with any promissory note (if requested by the applicable Lender) subject to such assignment and such parties shall deliver to Agent, for the benefit of Agent, a processing and recordation fee of $5,000 (except the payment of such fee shall not be required in connection with an assignment by a Lender to a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or a Related Fund of such Lender) and Agent shall have received all documentation and other information with respect to the assignee that is required by regulatory authorities under applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act, (3) no written consent of the Administrative Borrower shall be required in connection with any assignment by a Lender to a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or a Related Fund of such Lender or if (A) such assignment is in connection with any merger, amalgamation, consolidation, sale, transfer, or other disposition of all or any substantial portion of the business or loan portfolio of such Lender or (B) a Specified Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (4) so long as no Specified Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no such assignment shall be made to any Disqualified Institution without the consent of Administrative Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (5) no such assignment shall be made to any Loan Party, Equity Sponsor or any of their respective Affiliates.  Upon such execution, delivery and acceptance, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance and recordation on the Register, which effective date shall be at least 3 Business Days after the delivery thereof to Agent (or such shorter period as shall be agreed to by Agent and the parties to such assignment), (A) the assignee thereunder shall become a Lender hereunder and, in addition to the rights and obligations hereunder held by it immediately prior to such effective date, have the rights and obligations hereunder that have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and (B) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).
 
(c)        By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning Lender and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows:  (i) other than as provi

lity with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) the assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or the performance or observance by any Loan Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other documents and information it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the
 
46





 
assigning Lender, Agent or any Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (v) such assignee appoints and authorizes Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are required to be performed by it as a Lender.
 
(d)        Agent shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain, or cause to be maintained at its office, a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it that has been accepted by Agent and a register (the Register) for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Term Loan Commitments of, and the principal amount of the Loans (and stated interest thereon) (the Registered Loans).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Administrative Borrower and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(e)        Upon receipt by Agent of a completed Assignment and Acceptance and Agents acceptance of such Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to Section 14(b) (which consent of Agent must be evidenced by Agents execution of an acceptance to such Assignment and Acceptance), Agent shall record the information contained therein in the Register.
 
(f)        A Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be assigned or sold in whole or in part only by registration of such assignment or sale on the Register (and each registered note shall expressly so provide).  Any assignment or sale of all or part of such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by registration of such assignment or sale on the Register, together with the surrender of the registered note, if any, evidencing the same duly endorsed by (or accompanied by a written instrument of assignment or sale duly executed by) the holder of such registered note, whereupon, at the request of the designated assignee(s) or transferee(s), one or more new registered notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the designated assignee(s) or transferee(s).  Prior to the registration of assignment or sale of any Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same), Agent shall treat the Person in whose name such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) is registered on the Register as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving all payments thereon, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.
 
(g)        In the event that any Lender sells participations in a Registered Loan, such Lender shall, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent on behalf of the Borrowers, maintain, or cause to be maintained, a register, on which it enters the name of all participants in the Registered Loans held by it and the principal amount (and stated interest thereon) of the portion of the Registered Loan that is the subject of the participation (the Participant Register).  A Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be participated in whole or in part only by registration of such participation on the Participant Register (and each registered note shall expressly so provide).  Any participation of such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by the registration of such participation on the Participant Register.  The Participant Register shall be available for inspection by the Administrative Borrower and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  No Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other
 
47





 
obligations under any Loan Document) to any person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, Agent shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
(h)        Any Person who purchases or is assigned or participates in any portion of such Registered Loan shall, at the time such Person is claiming the benefits under Section 16, comply with any requirements described in Section 16 at the time such Person is claiming the benefits under Section 16.
 
(i)         Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Term Loan Commitment and the Loans made by it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement (including without limitation, its Term Loan Commitment hereunder) and the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged; (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and the Borrowers, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (iii) a participant shall not be entitled to require such Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder except (A) action directly effecting an extension of the maturity dates or decrease in the principal amount of the Loans, (B) action directly effecting an extension of the due dates or a decrease in the rate of interest payable on the Loans or the fees payable under this Agreement, or (C) actions directly effecting a release of all or  substantially all of the Collateral or all or substantially all of the Loan Parties; (iv) the sale of a participation shall not be made to any Loan Party, Equity Sponsor or any of their respective Affiliates, (v) to the extent the Borrowers have made the list of Disqualified Institutions available to the Lenders, so long as no Specified Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no participation shall be made to any Disqualified Institution and (vi) the sale of a participation to any holder of Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated to the Obligations shall require the written consent of the Agent, which consent the Agent may grant or withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.  The Loan Parties agree that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 16 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein) and Section 2.12 of this Agreement with respect to its participation in any portion of the Commitments and the Loans as if it were a Lender; provided that such participant complies with the requirements applicable to Lenders in such Sections, Section 2.14 and this Section 14 as if it were a Lender.
 
(j)         Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or loans made to such Lender pursuant to securitization or similar credit facility (a Securitization); provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  If requested by such Lender, the Loan Parties shall cooperate with such Lender and its Affiliates to effect the Securitization including, without limitation, by providing such information as may be reasonably requested by such Lender in connection with the rating of its Loans or the Securitization.
 
15.       AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS.
 
(a)        No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (other than the Fee Letter and other than any supplements or modifications to the Information
 
48





 
Certificate accepted by Agent or any joinder to the Guaranty required hereunder), and no consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed (x) in the case of an amendment, consent or waiver to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency or granting a new Lien for the benefit of Agent and the Lenders or extending an existing Lien over additional property, by Agent and the Borrowers (or by the Administrative Borrower on behalf of the Borrowers), (y) in the case of any other waiver or consent, by Agent and Required Lenders (or by Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) and the Borrowers (or by the Administrative Borrower on behalf of the Borrowers) and (z) in the case of any other amendment, by Agent and Required Lenders (or by Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) and the Borrowers (or by the Administrative Borrower on behalf of the Borrowers), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall:
 
(i)         increase the Term Loan Commitment of any Lender, reduce the principal of, or interest on, any Loan payable to any Lender, or reduce the amount of any fee payable for the account of any Lender, in each case, without the written consent of such Lender (except in connection with the waiver of default interest (which shall be effective with the consent of the Required Lenders)) (it being understood that any change to the definition of Net Senior Leverage Ratio or the component definitions thereof shall not constitute a reduction or forgiveness in interest);
 
(ii)        postpone or extend any scheduled date fixed for any payment (but not prepayment) of principal of, or interest or fees on, any Loan payable to any Lender, in each case, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

(vi)       except as provided in Section 2.2, create any new class, tranche or series of commitments or Loans, change any commitment or Loan to a commitment or Loan of a different class, tranche or series, or subordinate any commitment or Loan to the Loans and commitments held by another Lender, in each case, without the written consent of each Lender; or
 
(vii)      amend, modify or waive Section 2.4(e) or this Section 15 without the written consent of each Lender.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) no amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of the Fee Letter (or the definition thereof), and no consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Agent and the Borrowers (and shall not require the written consent of any of the Lenders), (B) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by Agent, affect the rights or duties of Agent (but not in its capacity as a

Lender) under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, (C) any amendment, waiver or consent to any provision of this Agreement (including Section 2.4(e) and Section 2.4(g)) that permits any Loan Party, Equity Sponsor or any of their respective Affiliates to purchase Loans on a non-pro rata basis, become an eligible assignee pursuant to Section 14 and/or make offers to make optional prepayments on a non-pro rata basis shall require the prior written consent of the Required Lenders rather than the prior written consent of each Lender, (D) any supplements or modifications to the Information Certificate shall require only the signature of (1) Administrative Borrower and (2) other than with respect to Schedules 5.1(c), 5.6(a), 5.6(b), 5.6(c), 5.15(a), 5.29 or 7.16, Agent, and (E) any joinder to the Guaranty required hereunder shall require only the signature of the applicable Loan Party.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) no Defaulting Lender, shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent under the Loan Documents and any Loans held by such Person for purposes hereof shall be automatically deemed to be voted pro rata according to the Loans of all other Lenders in the aggregate (other than such Defaulting Lender) and (ii) any Lender that also holds Indebtedness of any Loan Party that is contractually subordinated to the Obligations (x) shall be excluded from the determination of Required Lenders, and shall not have voting rights with respect to any matters requiring the approval of Required Lenders and (y) shall have voting rights solely with respect to the matters described in clause (i) of this Section 15(a) and otherwise shall not have any voting rights under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
 
(b)        If any action to be taken by the Lenders hereunder requires the consent, authorization, or agreement of all of the Lenders or any Lender affected thereby, and a Lender other than Agent (or an affiliate of Agent) (the Holdout Lender) fails to give its consent, authorization, or agreement, then Administrative Borrower or Agent, upon at least 5 Business Days prior notice to the Holdout Lender and, in the case of any such replacement by Administrative Borrower, Agent, may replace the Holdout Lender with one or more substitute lenders reasonably acceptable to Agent (each, a Replacement Lender), and the Holdout Lender shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder.  Such notice to replace the Holdout Lender shall specify an effective date for such replacement, which date shall not be later than 15 Business Days after the date such notice is given.  Prior to the effective date of such replacement, the Holdout Lender and each Replacement Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance, subject only to the Holdout Lender being repaid its share of the outstanding Obligations without any premium or penalty of any kind whatsoever.  If the Holdout Lender shall refuse or fail to execute and deliver any such Assignment and Acceptance prior to the effective date of such replacement, the Holdout Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance.  The replacement of any Holdout Lender shall be made in accordance with the terms of Section 14 (including with the consent of Administrative Borrower to the extent required by Section 14(b)).  Until such time as the Replacement Lender shall have acquired all of the Obligations, the Term Loan Commitments, and the other rights and obligations of the Holdout Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Holdout Lender shall remain obligated to make its Pro Rata Share of the Term Loan.
 
(c)        No failure on the part of Agent or any Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right under any Loan Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.  The rights and remedies of Agent and the Lenders provided herein and in the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are in addition to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies provided by law.  The rights of Agent and the Lenders under any Loan Document against any party thereto are not conditional or contingent on any attempt by Agent and the Lenders to exercise any of their rights under any other Loan Document against such party or against any other Person.

16.       TAXES.
 
(a)        Any and all payments by any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of the applicable Loan Party or Agent) requires deduction or withholding of any tax, excluding (i) taxes imposed on or measured by the net income (however denominated) of Agent or any Lender (or any transferee or assignee thereof, including a participation holder (any such entity, a Transferee)),  franchise taxes, and branch profits taxes , in each case (A) imposed as a result of Agent, such Lender or Transferee being organized under the laws of, or having its principal office or applicable lending office located in, the jurisdiction imposing such tax (or any other political subdivision thereof) or (B) imposed as a result of a present or former connection between Agent, such Lender or Transferee and the jurisdiction imposing such tax (other than connections arising solely from entering into any Loan Document, receiving a payment thereunder, securing collateral with respect thereto, or enforcing any right or remedy with respect thereto), (ii) U.S. federal withholding taxes attributable to Agents or any Lenders (or Transferees) failure to comply with Section 16(d) and (iii) any U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed under FATCA (all such nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges withholdings and liabilities, collectively or individually, Taxes, and all such excluded taxes, Excluded Taxes) from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to Agent or any Lender (or any Transferee), (i) the sum payable by the Loan Party shall be increased by the amount (an Additional Amount) necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 16) Agent or such Lender (or such Transferee) shall receive an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
(b)        In addition, each Loan Party agrees to pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (Other Taxes).  Each Loan Party shall deliver to Agent official receipts or other evidence of such payment reasonably acceptable to Agent in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes payable hereunder as soon as practicable after payment of such Taxes or Other Taxes.
 
(c)        The Loan Parties hereby jointly and severally indemnify and agree to hold each Agent and each Lender harmless from and against Taxes and Other Taxes and related expenses including reasonable attorneys fees and tax advisor fees (including, without limitation, Taxes and Other Taxes imposed on any amounts payable under this Section 16) paid by such Person, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  Such indemnification shall be paid within 10 days from the date on which any such Person makes written demand therefore specifying in reasonable detail the nature and amount of such Taxes or Other Taxes, absent manifest error in such written demand.
 
(d)        If any Lender (or Transferee) is entitled under applicable law to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document, such Lender (or Transferee) shall deliver to Administrative Borrower and Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by Administrative Borrower or Agent, such properly completed an executed documentation reasonably requested by Administrative Borrower or Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, if reasonably requested by Administrative Borrower or Agent, each Lender (or Transferee) shall deliver such other documentation
 
51





 
prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by Administrative Borrower or Agent as will enable Administrative Borrower or Agent to determine whether or not such Lender (or Transferee) is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 16(d)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) below) shall not be required if in the applicable Lenders or Transferees reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender or Transferee to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender, Transferee or their respective Affiliates. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
 
(i)         Each Lender (or Transferee) that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States (a Non-U.S. Lender) agrees that it shall, no later than the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Lender which becomes a party hereto pursuant to Section 14 hereof after the Closing Date, on or before the date upon which such Lender becomes a party hereto) deliver to Administrative Borrower and Agent one properly completed and duly executed originals of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E W-8ECI or W-8IMY or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, in each case claiming complete exemption from, or reduced rate of, U.S. Federal withholding tax and payments of interest hereunder.  In addition, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the IRC, such Non-U.S. Lender hereby represents to the Administrative Borrower and Agent that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the IRC, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the IRC) of a Loan Party and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to a Loan Party (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the IRC), and such Non-U.S. Lender agrees that it shall promptly notify Administrative Borrower and Agent in the event any such representation is no longer accurate.  Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a Transferee that is a participation holder, on or before the date such participation holder becomes a Transferee hereunder) and on or before the date, if any, such Non-U.S. Lender changes its applicable lending office by designating a different lending office (a New Lending Office).  In addition, such Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms within 20 days after receipt of a written request therefor from any Administrative Borrower, Agent, the assigning Lender or the Lender granting a participation, as applicable.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 16, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section 16(d) that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.
 
(ii)        Each Lender (or Transferee) that is a United States person (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the IRC) (each a U.S. Lender) agrees that it shall, no later than the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Lender which becomes a party hereto pursuant to Section 14 after the Closing Date, or before the date upon which such Lender becomes a party hereto) deliver to Administrative Borrower and Agent a complete and duly executed original of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto certifying that such Lender (or Transferee) is not subject to United States backup withholding tax on the date it becomes a party to this Agreement.  In addition, such U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms within 20 days after receipt of a written request therefore from Administrative Borrower, Agent, the assigning Lender or the Lender granting a participation, as applicable.
 
(iii)       any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Administrative Borrower and Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of any Borrower or Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be
 
52





 
prescribed by applicable law to permit Administrative Borrower or Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(iv)       if a payment made to Agent or a Lender (or any Transferee) under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if Agent or such Lender (or Transferee) were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the IRC, as applicable), Agent or such Lender (or Transferee) shall deliver to Administrative Borrower and Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by any Borrower or Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by any Borrower as may be necessary for such Borrower to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that Agent or such Lender (or Transferee) has complied with Agents or such Lenders (or Transferees) obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (iv), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each Lender (or Transferee) and Agent agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Administrative Borrower and Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(e)        The Loan Parties shall not be required to indemnify any Non-U.S. Lender, or pay any Additional Amounts to any Non-U.S. Lender, in respect of United States Federal withholding tax pursuant to this Section 16 to the extent that (i) the obligation to withhold amounts with respect to United States Federal withholding tax existed on the date such Non-U.S. Lender became a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a Transferee that is a participation holder, on the date such participation holder became a Transferee hereunder) or, with respect to payments to a New Lending Office, the date such Non-U.S. Lender (or Transferee) designated such New Lending Office with respect to a Loan; provided, however, that this clause (i) shall not apply to the extent the indemnity payment or Additional Amounts any Transferee, or Lender (or Transferee) through a New Lending Office, would be entitled to receive (without regard to this clause (i)) do not exceed the indemnity payment or Additional Amounts that the Person making the assignment, participation or transfer to such Transferee, or Lender (or Transferee) making the designation of such New Lending Office, would have been entitled to receive in the absence of such assignment, participation, transfer or designation, or (ii) the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Non-U.S. Lender (or Transferee) to comply with the provisions of clause (d) above.
 
(f)        Agent or any Lender (or Transferee) claiming any indemnity payment or additional payment amounts payable pursuant to this Section 16 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or document reasonably requested in writing by the Administrative Borrower or to change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a filing or change would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such indemnity payment or additional amount that may thereafter accrue, would not require Agent or such Lender (or Transferee) to disclose any information Agent or such Lender (or Transferee) deems confidential and would not, in the reasonable determination of Agent or such Lender (or Transferee), be otherwise disadvantageous to Agent or  such Lender (or Transferee).
 
(g)        Treatment of Certain Refunds.  So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, if any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 16 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 16), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made
 
53





 
under this Section with respect to such Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, however, that if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any amounts otherwise payable to any Loan Party pursuant to this Section 16(g) shall be paid to Agents Account and shall be treated as payments made by Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.4(e), provided, further, that no such payments shall require payment of any Applicable Prepayment Premium.  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such tax had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
(h)        The obligations of the Loan Parties, Agent and the Lenders (and Transferees) under this Section 16 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
17.       AGENT
 
17.1.    Appointment and Authorization.
 
Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes Agent to enter into each of the Loan Documents and any subordination and/or intercreditor agreements with the holders of other Indebtedness of the Loan Parties on its behalf and to take such actions as Agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are delegated to Agent by the terms thereof, together with all such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 14 or by the terms of the Loan Documents, Agent is authorized and empowered to amend, modify, or waive any provisions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents on behalf of Lenders.  Except as provided in Section 17.9(c) and Section 17.12: (i) the provisions of this Article 17 are solely for the benefit of Agent and Lenders and (ii) neither Borrowers nor any other Loan Party shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions hereof.  In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement, Agent shall act solely as agent of Lenders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with or for Borrower or any other Loan Party.  Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder, or under the Loan Documents, by or through its agents or employees.
 
17.2.    Agent and Affiliates.
 
If Agent is also a Lender, it shall have the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not Agent, and Agent and its Affiliates may lend money to, invest in and generally engage in any kind of business with each Loan Party or Affiliate of any Loan Party as if it were not Agent hereunder.
 
54

 




 
17.3.                Action by Agent.
 
The duties of Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature.  Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender.  Nothing in this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, express or implied, is intended to or shall be construed to impose upon Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents except as expressly set forth herein or therein.
 
17.4.                Consultation with Experts.
 
Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
17.5.                Liability of Agent.
 
Neither Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to any Lender for any action taken or not taken by it in connection with the Loan Documents, except that Agent shall be liable to the extent of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Neither Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements specified in any Loan Document; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in any Loan Document, except receipt of items required to be delivered to Agent; (iv) the validity, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Loan Document, any Lien purported to be created or perfected thereby or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; (v) the existence or non-existence of any Default or Event of Default; or (vi) the financial condition of any Loan Party.  Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or other writing (which may be a bank wire, telex, facsimile or electronic transmission or similar writing) believed by it to be genuine or to be signed by the proper party or parties.  Agent shall not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole recourse of any Lender to whom payment was due but not made, shall be to recover from other Lenders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to be entitled (and such other Lenders hereby agree to return to such Lender any such erroneous payments received by them).
 
17.6.                Indemnification.
 
Each Lender shall, in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, indemnify Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by Borrower) and hold Agent harmless against any cost, expense (including counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) that Agent may suffer or incur in connection with the Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by Agent hereunder or thereunder.  If any indemnity furnished to Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against even if so directed by Required Lenders until such additional indemnity is furnished.  The obligations of Lenders under this Section 17.6 shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
 
55





 
17.7.                Right to Request and Act on Instructions.
 
Agent may at any time request instructions from Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents Agent is permitted or desires to take or to grant, and Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from any action or withholding any approval under any of the Loan Documents until it shall have received such instructions from Required Lenders or all or such other portion of the Lenders as shall be prescribed by this Agreement.  Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of Required Lenders or all or such other portion of the Lenders as shall be prescribed by this Agreement and, notwithstanding the instructions of Required Lenders, Agent shall have no obligation to take any action if it believes, in good faith, that such action exposes Agent to any liability for which it has not received satisfactory indemnification in accordance with the provisions of Section 17.6.
 
17.8.                Credit Decision.
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking any action under the Loan Documents.
 
17.9.                Collateral Matters.
 
(a)                               Lenders irrevocably authorize Agent, at its option and in its discretion, (i) to release any Lien granted to or held by Agent under any Loan Document in accordance with Section 2.10 (or with the approval of Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be, in accordance with Section 15), and (ii) to release any Loan Party whose Stock is sold or transferred from its obligations under any of the Loan Documents in accordance with Section 2.10 (or with the approval of Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be, in accordance with Section 15).
 
(b)                              Agent may conclusively rely without further inquiry on a certificate of an officer of any Loan Party as to the sale, transfer or other disposition of property (including equity interests) being made in full compliance with the provisions of the Loan Documents.  Upon request by Agent at any time, Lenders will confirm in writing Agents authority to release particular types or items of Collateral or a particular Loan Party from its obligations under any of the Loan Documents pursuant to this Section 17.9.
 
(c)                               In connection with any release contemplated by this Section 10.9, Agent agrees to execute and deliver to Borrowers, at Borrowers reasonable request and at Borrowers expense, such documents as Agent reasonably deems appropriate to evidence such release.
 
17.10.        Agency for Perfection.
 
Agent and each Lender hereby appoint each other Lender as agent for the purpose of perfecting Agents security interest in assets which, in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code in any applicable jurisdiction, can be perfected by possession or control.  Should any Lender (other than Agent) obtain possession or control of any such assets, such Lender shall notify Agent thereof, and, promptly upon Agents request therefore, shall deliver such assets to Agent or in accordance with Agents
 
56





 
instructions or transfer control to Agent in accordance with Agents instructions.  Each Lender agrees that it will not have any right individually to enforce or seek to enforce any Loan Document or to realize upon any Collateral for the Obligations unless instructed to do so by Agent, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised only by Agent.
 
17.11.        Notice of Default.
 
Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to Agent for the account of Lenders, unless Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or a Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default.  Agent will notify each Lender of its receipt of any such notice.  Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by Required Lenders (or if required all Lenders or all affected Lenders) in accordance with the terms hereof.  Unless and until Agent has received any such request, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interests of Lenders.
 
17.12.        Successor Agent.
 
Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and Administrative Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, Required Lenders and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Administrative Borrower, shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent.  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent gives notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be an institution organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  After any retiring Agents resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 17 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent.
 
17.13.        Return of Payments.
 
(a)                               If Agent pays an amount to a Lender under this Agreement in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received by Agent from Borrowers and such related payment is not received by Agent, then Agent will be entitled to recover such amount from such Lender on demand without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind, together with interest accruing on a daily basis at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
 
(b)                              If Agent determines at any time that any amount received by Agent under this Agreement must be returned to a Borrower or paid to any other Person pursuant to any insolvency law or otherwise, then, notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Lender.  In addition, each Lender will repay to Agent on demand any portion of such amount that Agent has distributed to such Lender, together with interest at such rate, if any, as Agent is required to pay to Borrowers or such other Person, without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.
 
57





 
17.14.        Right to Perform, Preserve and Protect.
 
If any Loan Party fails to perform any obligation hereunder or under any other Loan Document, Agent itself may, but shall not be obligated to, cause such obligation to be performed at Borrowers expense.  Agent is further authorized by Borrowers and the Lenders upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default or during such time as exigent circumstances exist, to make expenditures (Agent Advances) from time to time which Agent, in its reasonable business judgment, deems necessary or desirable to (i) preserve or protect the business conducted by Borrower, the Collateral, or any portion thereof and/or (ii) enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Loans and other Obligations.  Borrowers hereby agrees to reimburse Agent on demand for any and all reasonable costs, liabilities and obligations incurred by Agent pursuant to this Section 17.14.  Each Lender hereby agrees to indemnify Agent upon demand for any and all costs, liabilities and obligations incurred by Agent pursuant to this Section 17.14, in accordance with the provisions of Section 17.6. For purposes of this Section 17.14 exigent circumstances means any circumstances causing Agent or Required Lenders to reasonably believe that an expenditure is necessary or appropriate in order to prevent or mitigate the destruction of, physical harm to, impairment of or decrease in value of the Collateral or the rights and interests of Agent and Lenders (including any loss of priority of the Liens of Agent under the Loan Documents).  Agent Advances shall be repayable on demand (without any prepayment premium or penalty) and be secured by the Collateral and shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans.  Agent Advances shall constitute Obligations hereunder.  Agent shall notify each Lender and the Administrative Borrower in writing of each such Agent Advance, which notice shall include a description of the purpose of such Agent Advance.  Without limitation to its obligations pursuant to Section 17.6, each Lender agrees that it shall make available to Agent, upon the Agents demand, in Dollars in immediately available funds, the amount equal to such Lenders Pro Rata Share of each such Agent Advance.  If such funds are not made available to Agent by such Lender, Agent shall be entitled to recover such funds on demand from such Lender, together with interest thereon for each day from the date such payment was due until the date such amount is paid to Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for three Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall (i) Agent make or be authorized to make any Agent Advance that would cause Indebtedness outstanding under this Agreement to exceed Maximum Term Principal Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), (ii) any Agent Advance cause a Default or Event of Default under Section 8 that would not exist in the absence of such Agent Advance or (iii) any Agent Advance be subject to any prepayment premium or penalty (including the Applicable Prepayment Premium).
 
18.                            GENERAL PROVISIONS.
 
18.1.                Effectiveness.  This Agreement shall be binding and deemed effective when executed by each Borrower, each other Loan Party, each Lender and Agent.
 
18.2.                Section Headings.  Headings and numbers have been set forth herein for convenience only.  Unless the contrary is compelled by the context, everything contained in each Section applies equally to this entire Agreement.
 
18.3.                Interpretation.  Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be construed against Agent or any Loan Party, whether under any rule of construction or otherwise.  On the contrary, this Agreement has been reviewed by all parties and shall be construed and interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the words used so as to accomplish fairly the purposes and intentions of all parties hereto.
 
58





 
18.4.                Severability of Provisions.  Each provision of this Agreement shall be severable from every other provision of this Agreement for the purpose of determining the legal enforceability of any specific provision.
 
18.5.                Debtor-Creditor Relationship.  The relationship between Agent and Lenders, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other hand, is solely that of creditor and debtor.  Neither Agent nor any Lender shall have (and shall not be deemed to have) any fiduciary relationship or duty to any Loan Party arising out of or in connection with the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, and there is no agency or joint venture relationship between Agent or any Lender, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other hand, by virtue of any Loan Document or any transaction contemplated therein.

18.7.                Revival and Reinstatement of Obligations.  If the incurrence or payment of the Obligations by any Borrower or any other Loan Party or the transfer to Agent or any Lender of any property should for any reason subsequently be asserted, or declared, to be void or voidable under any state or federal law relating to creditors rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code relating to fraudulent conveyances, preferences, or other voidable or recoverable payments of money or transfers of property (each, a Voidable Transfer), and if Agent or any Lender is required to repay or restore, in whole or in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elects to do so upon the reasonable advice of its counsel, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount thereof that Agent or such Lender is required or elects to repay or restore, and as to all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys fees of Agent or such Lender related thereto, the liability of such Borrower and such other Loan Party automatically shall be revived, reinstated, and restored and shall exist as though such Voidable Transfer had never been made and all of Agents Liens in the Collateral shall be automatically reinstated without further action.
 
18.8.                Confidentiality.
 
(a)                               Agent and each Lender agrees (on behalf of itself and each of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees and representatives) to use reasonable precautions to keep confidential, in accordance with its customary procedures for handling confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe and sound practices of comparable commercial finance companies, any non-public information supplied to it by the Loan Parties pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (and which at the time is not, and does not thereafter become, publicly available or available to such Person from another source not known to be subject to a confidentiality obligation to such Person not to disclose such information), provided that nothing herein shall limit the disclosure by any Agent or any Lender of any such information (i) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, trustees, counsel, advisors and representatives who need to know such information in connection with providing the Loan or acting as Agent hereunder (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such information and instructed to keep such information confidential in accordance with this Section 18.8); (ii) to any other party hereto; (iii) to any assignee or participant (or prospective assignee or participant) or

(b)                              Each Loan Party agrees that neither it nor any of its controlled Affiliates will now or in the future issue any press release or other public disclosure using the name of Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates or referring to this Agreement or any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of Agent or such Lender (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned and such consent shall be deemed given if not provided by the Agent or such Lender within 5 Business Days after receipt of written request therefor), except to the extent that such Loan Party or such controlled Affiliate is required to do so under applicable law (in which event, to the extent permissible, such Loan Party or such controlled Affiliate will consult with Agent or such Lender before issuing such press release or other public disclosure).  Each Loan Party hereby authorizes Agent and each Lender, after consultation with the Borrowers, to advertise the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to make appropriate announcements of the financial arrangements entered into among the parties hereto, as Agent or such Lender shall deem appropriate, including, without limitation, on a home page or similar place for dissemination of information on the Internet or worldwide web, or in announcements commonly known as tombstones, in such trade publications, business journals, newspapers of general circulation and to such selected parties as Agent or such Lender shall deem appropriate.
 
18.9.                Expenses.  Borrowers hereby agree to promptly pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Agent (including without limitation the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses of counsel to, and independent appraisers and consultants retained by Agent) in connection with the examination, review, due diligence investigation, documentation, negotiation, closing and syndication of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, in connection with the performance by Agent of its rights and remedies under the Loan Documents and in connection with the continued administration of the Loan Documents including any amendments, modifications, consents and waivers to and/or under any and all Loan Documents, (ii) without limitation of the preceding clause (i), all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Agent in connection with the creation, perfection and maintenance of Liens pursuant to the Loan Documents, including title investigations, lien searches and the like, (iii) without limitation of the preceding clause (i), expenses of Agent in connection with protecting, storing, insuring, handling, maintaining or selling any Collateral and in connection with any workout, collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings under any and all of the Loan Documents, (iv) all costs and expenses incurred by Agent in connection with any workout, collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings under any and all Loan Documents, and (v) all costs and expenses for travel and counsel incurred by any Lender after the Closing Date in connection with any workout, collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings under any and all Loan Documents; provided that, in the case of costs and
 
60





 
expenses of outside counsel, such costs and expenses shall be limited to the costs and expenses of (x) one primary outside counsel for Agent, (y) one local counsel in each jurisdiction as is reasonably necessary, and (z) in the case of an actual or potential conflict of interest among any one or more of Agent and any Lender, one additional counsel for each group of similarly situated Persons.  Each Borrower agrees that its obligations contained in this Section 18.9 shall survive payment or satisfaction in full of all other Obligations.
 
18.10.        Setoff.  If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Agent or any Lender may, in its sole discretion at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by Agent or such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Borrowers or any Guarantor against any of and all the Obligations held by Agent or such Lender, irrespective of whether or not Agent or such Lender shall have made any demand under the Loan Documents and although such obligations may be unmatured. Agent or any Lender exercising such set-off shall notify the Administrative Borrower (and in the case of a Lender, Agent) of such set-off or application, provided that any failure to give or any delay in giving such notice shall not affect the validity of any such set-off or application under this Section.
 
18.11.        Survival.  All representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any of the Obligations is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the obligation of Agent or any Lender to provide extensions of credit hereunder has not expired or been terminated.
 
18.12.        Patriot Act.  Agent and each Lender hereby notify the Loan Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of each Loan Party and other information that will allow Agent and such Lender to identify each Loan Party in accordance with the Patriot Act.

18.13.        Integration.  This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, reflects the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not be contradicted or qualified by any other agreement, oral or written, before the date hereof.
 
18.14.        Conflict.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the priority of the Liens and security interest granted to Agent, for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the exercise of any right or remedy by Agent hereunder and thereunder are subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.  In the event of any direct conflict between the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the priority of the Liens and security interests granted herein or therein and/or the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall govern and control.

This Agreement and the other Loan Documents will, when executed and delivered, create a valid security interest in the Collateral of each Loan Party, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.  Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, when the Collateral constituting Certificated Securities, Instruments or Chattel Paper is delivered to Agent, together with instruments of transfer duly endorsed in blank, the security interest created under this Agreement in such Collateral will constitute a fully perfected security interest in all right, title and interest of the applicable Loan Party hereunder in such Collateral. When financing statements in appropriate form are filed in the applicable filing offices, the security interest created under this Agreement will constitute a fully perfected security interest in all right, title and interest of the applicable Loan Party in the remaining Collateral to the extent perfection can be obtained by filing Uniform Commercial Code financing statements.  Upon filing of the Copyright Security Agreement with the United States Copyright Office (if applicable), filing of the Patent and Trademark Security Agreement with the PTO, and the filing of appropriate financing statements in the jurisdictions listed on Schedule 5.6(a) to the Information Certificate, all action necessary to protect and pe
