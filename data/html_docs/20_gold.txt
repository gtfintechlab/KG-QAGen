Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:(i)    the aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Loans shall not be less than $1,000,000 or, if greater, an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, and the aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing comprised of LIBOR Loans shall not be less than $1,000,000 or, if greater, an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof (or, in each case if less than the minimum amount, in the amount of the aggregate Unutilized Commitments);(ii)    if the Borrower shall have failed to designate the Type of Loans comprising a Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Loans; and(iii)    if the Borrower shall have failed to select the duration of the Interest Period to be applicable to any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period with a duration of one (1) month;(c)    Not later than 2:00 p.m. on the requested Borrowing Date, each applicable Lender will make available to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office an amount, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, equal to the amount of the Loan or Loans to be made by such Lender.  To the extent such Lenders have made such amounts available to the Administrative Agent as provided hereinabove, the Administrative Agent will make the aggregate of such amounts available to the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.3(a) and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.Section 2.3    Disbursements; Funding Reliance; Domicile of Loans.(a)    The Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to disburse the proceeds of each Borrowing in accordance with the terms of any written instructions from any Authorized Officer of the Borrower; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated under any circumstances to forward amounts to any account not listed in an Account Designation Letter.  The Borrower may at any time deliver to the Administrative Agent an Account Designation Letter listing any additional accounts or deleting any accounts listed in a previous Account Designation Letter.(b)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.2(c) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative 22Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the rate applicable to such Loan.

The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any such payment on any date shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation, if any, hereunder to do so on such date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, purchase its participation or to make any such payment required hereunder.(d)    Each Lender may, at its option, make and maintain any Loan at, to or for the account of any of its Lending Offices; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan to or for the account of such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.Section 2.4    Evidence of Debt; Notes.(a)    Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to the applicable Lending Office of such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lending Office of such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lending Office of such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.(b)    The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 10.6(c), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount of each such Loan, the Type of each such Loan and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder in respect of each such Loan and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower in respect of each such Loan and each Lender’s share thereof.(c)    The entries made in the accounts, Register and subaccounts maintained pursuant to Section 2.4(b) (and, if consistent with the entries of the Administrative Agent, Section 2.4(a)) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not affect the ultimate obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.23(d)    The Loans made by each Lender shall, if requested by the applicable Lender (which request shall be made to the Administrative Agent), be evidenced by a Note appropriately completed in the form of Exhibit A, executed by the Borrower and payable to the order of such Lender.  Each Note shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and shall be subject to the provisions hereof and thereof.Section 2.5    Termination of Commitment.(a)    The Commitment shall be automatically and permanently terminated on the Termination Date, unless terminated earlier pursuant to any other provision of this Section 2.5 or Section 8.2.(b)    At any time and from time to time after the date hereof, upon not less than five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may terminate in whole or reduce in part the aggregate Unutilized Commitments and the Commitment Fee will be reduced accordingly as of the date of such termination or reduction; provided that any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than $1,000,000 or, if greater, an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof.

Each such notice shall specify the proposed date of such prepayment and the aggregate principal amount and Type of the Loans to be prepaid (and, in the case of LIBOR Loans, the Interest Period of the Borrowing pursuant to which made), and shall be irrevocable and shall bind the Borrower to make such prepayment on the terms specified therein.  Loans prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.7(a) may be reborrowed, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  In the event the Administrative Agent receives a notice of prepayment under this Section 2.7(a), the Administrative Agent will give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders; provided that if such notice has also been furnished to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to notify the Lenders with respect thereto.(b)    Each prepayment of the Loans made pursuant to Section 2.7(a) shall be applied ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans being prepaid, in proportion to the principal amount held by each.Section 2.8    Interest.(a)    The Borrower will pay interest in respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Loan, from the date of Borrowing thereof until such principal amount shall be paid in full, (i) at the Adjusted Base Rate, as in effect from time to time during such periods as such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, and (ii) at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate, as in effect from time to time during such periods as such Loan is a LIBOR Loan.(b)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default under Sections 8.1(a), 8.1(f) or 8.1(g) and (at the election of the Required Lenders) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any other Event of Default, all outstanding principal amounts of the Loans and, to the greatest extent permitted by law, all interest accrued on the Loans and all other accrued and outstanding fees and other amounts hereunder, shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable from time to time thereafter to such Loans (whether the Adjusted Base Rate or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate) plus 2% (or, in the case of interest, fees and other amounts for which no rate is provided hereunder, at the Adjusted Base Rate applicable to Loans plus 2%), and, in each case, such default interest shall be payable on demand.  To the greatest extent permitted by law, interest shall continue to accrue after the filing by or against the Borrower of any petition seeking any relief in bankruptcy or under any law pertaining to insolvency or debtor relief.(c)    Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest shall be payable as follows:(i)    

ogether with such repayment or prepayment on the date thereof;(ii)    in respect of each LIBOR Loan (including any LIBOR Loan or portion thereof paid or prepaid pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.6 or Section 2.7, except as provided herein), in arrears (x) on the last Business Day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (subject to Section 2.10(iv)), (y) in addition, in the case of a LIBOR Loan with an Interest Period having a duration of six (6) months, on each date on which interest would have been payable under clause (x) above had successive Interest Periods of three (3) months’ duration been applicable to such LIBOR Loan and (z) on the date of any prepayment or repayment of a LIBOR Loan; and(iii)    in respect of any Loan, at the Maturity Date (whether pursuant to acceleration or otherwise) and, after the Maturity Date, on demand.(d)    Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document shall be deemed to establish or require the payment of interest to any Lender at a rate in excess of the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.  If the rate of interest payable for the account of any Lender on any interest payment date would exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law to be charged by such Lender, the rate of interest payable for its account on such interest payment date shall be automatically reduced to such maximum permissible rate.  In the event of any such reduction affecting any Lender, if from time to time thereafter the rate of interest payable for the account of such Lender on any interest payment date would be less than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law to be charged by such Lender, then the rate of interest payable for its account on such subsequent interest payment date shall be automatically increased to a rate (not to exceed the maximum permissible rate) such that the amount of the rate increase is equivalent to the amount of the prior rate decrease; provided that (i) at no time shall the aggregate amount by which interest paid for the account of any Lender has been increased pursuant to this sentence exceed the aggregate amount by which interest paid for its account has theretofore been reduced pursuant to the previous sentence, and (ii) nothing herein shall be deemed to deprive the Borrower of the benefit of a reduction in the Applicable Percentage.(e)    The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders upon determining the interest rate for each Borrowing of LIBOR Loans after its receipt of the relevant Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation, and upon each change in the Adjusted Base Rate; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent to provide the Borrower or the Lenders with any such notice shall neither affect any obligations of the Borrower or the Lenders hereunder nor result in any liability on the part of the Administrative Agent to the Borrower or any Lender.  Each such determination shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.26Section 2.9    Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay:(a)    To the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, a commitment fee (a “Commitment Fee”), which shall accrue at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Percentage in effect for such fee from time to time during each calendar quarter (or portion thereof) on such Lender’s Ratable Share of the average daily aggregate Unutilized Commitments during the period from and including the date hereof to, but excluding, the Termination Date.

00,000 or, if greater, an integral multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof; and no partial conversion of LIBOR Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of such LIBOR Loans to less than $500,000 or to any greater amount not an integral multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, (y) except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.16(e) and 2.16(f), LIBOR Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans only on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (and, in any event, if a LIBOR Loan is converted into a Base Rate Loan on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower will pay, upon such conversion, all amounts required under Section 2.18 to be paid as a consequence thereof), and (z) no conversion of Base Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans or continuation of LIBOR Loans shall be permitted during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default.(b)    The Borrower shall make each such election by giving the Administrative Agent written notice not later than 12:00 p.m. three (3) Business Days prior to the intended effective date of any conversion of Base Rate Loans into, or continuation of, LIBOR Loans and one (1) Business Day prior to the intended effective date of any conversion of LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans, unless such notice requirement is shortened by the Administrative Agent.  Each such notice (each, a “Notice of Conversion/Continuation”) shall be irrevocable, shall be given in the form of Exhibit B-2 and shall specify (x) the date of such conversion or continuation (which shall be a Business Day), (y) in the case of a conversion into, or a continuation of, LIBOR Loans, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto, and (z) the aggregate amount and Type of the Loans being converted or continued.  In the event that 28the Borrower shall fail to deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation as provided herein with respect to any outstanding LIBOR Loans for which notice of the expiration of the Interest Period has been provided by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.10(vii), such LIBOR Loans shall automatically be converted to Base Rate Loans upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto (unless repaid pursuant to the terms hereof); provided that if the Administrative Agent has not delivered such notice pursuant to Section 2.10(vii), such Loans shall be continued as LIBOR Loans with an Interest Period of one (1) month.  In the event the Borrower shall have failed to select in a Notice of Conversion/Continuation the duration of the Interest Period to be applicable to any conversion into, or continuation of, LIBOR Loans, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period with a duration of one (1) month.Section 2.12    Method of Payments; Computations.(a)    All payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, in Dollars and in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders entitled to such payment (except as otherwise expressly provided herein as to payments required to be made directly to the Lenders) at the Payment Office prior to 12:00 noon on the date payment is due.  Any payment made as required hereinabove, but after 12:00 noon shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day.  If any payment falls due on a day that is not a Business Day, then such due date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (except that in the case of LIBOR Loans to which the provisions of Section 2.10(iv) are applicable, such due date shall be the next preceding Business Day), and such extension of time shall then be included in the computation of payment of interest, fees or other applicable amounts.(b)    The Administrative Agent will distribute to the Lenders like amounts relating to payments made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders as follows: (i) if the payment is received by 12:00 noon in immediately available funds, the Administrative Agent will make available to each relevant Lender on the same date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, such Lender’s Ratable Share of such payment, and (ii) if such payment is received after 12:00 noon or in other than immediately available funds, the Administrative Agent will make available to each such Lender its Ratable Share of such payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the next succeeding Business Day (or in the case of uncollected funds, as soon as practicable after collected).  If the Administrative Agent shall not have made a required distribution to the appropriate Lenders as required hereinabove after receiving a payment for the account of such Lenders, the Administrative Agent will pay to each such Lender, on demand, its Ratable Share of such payment with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount was required to be disbursed by the Administrative Agent until the date repaid to such Lender.(c)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from 29and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.(d)    All computations of interest and fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year consisting of (i) in the case of interest on Base Rate Loans based on the prime commercial lending rate of the Administrative Agent, 365/366 days, as the case may be, or (ii) in all other instances, 360 days; and in each case under (i) and (ii) above, with regard to the actual number of days (including the first day, but excluding the last day) elapsed.(e)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document to the contrary, all amounts collected or received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender after acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 8.2 shall be applied by the Administrative Agent as follows:(i)    first, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ and consultants’ fees irrespective of whether such fees are allowed as a claim after the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event) of the Administrative Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under the Credit Documents;(ii)    second, to the payment of any fees owed to the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Credit Document;(iii)    third, to the payment of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ and consultants’ fees irrespective of whether such fees are allowed as a claim after the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event) of each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under the Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to the Obligations owing to such Lender;(iv)    fourth, to the payment of all of the Obligations consisting of accrued fees and interest (including, without limitation, fees incurred and interest accruing at the then applicable rate after the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event irrespective of whether a claim for such fees incurred and interest accruing is allowed in such proceeding);(v)    fifth, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Obligations;(vi)    sixth, to the payment of all other Obligations and other obligations that shall have become due and payable under the Credit Documents or otherwise and not repaid; and(vii)    seventh, to the payment of the surplus (if any) to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.In carrying out the foregoing, (y) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category, and (z) all amounts shall be 30apportioned ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the amounts of such principal, interest, fees or other Obligations owed to them respectively pursuant to clauses (iii) through (vii) above.Section 2.13    Recovery of Payments.(a)    The Borrower agrees that to the extent the Borrower makes a payment or payments to or for the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, which payment or payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any Debtor Relief Law, common law or equitable cause (whether as a result of any demand, settlement, litigation or otherwise), then, to the extent of such payment or repayment, the Obligation intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been received.(b)    If any amounts distributed by the Administrative Agent to any Lender are subsequently returned or repaid by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, its representative or successor in interest, or any other Person, whether by court order, by settlement approved by such Lender, or pursuant to applicable Requirements of Law, such Lender will, promptly upon receipt of notice thereof from the Administrative Agent, pay the Administrative Agent such amount.  If any such amounts are recovered by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower, its representative or successor in interest or such other Person, the Administrative Agent will redistribute such amounts to the Lenders on the same basis as such amounts were originally distributed.Section 2.14    Use of Proceeds.(a)    The proceeds of the Loans shall be used (i) to repay all obligations under the Existing Credit Facility in full, if any, (ii) to pay or reimburse permitted fees and expenses in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and (iii) to provide for working capital and general corporate purposes and in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including Permitted Acquisitions.(b)    The Borrower will not (i) request any Loan, (ii) use the proceeds of any Loan, or (iii) lend, contribute or otherwise make available such proceeds to any Subsidiary, or knowingly to any other Person, in the case of any of the foregoing (x) in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment or giving of money, or anything else of value, to any Person in violation of any Anti-Corruption Laws, (y) for the purpose of funding, financing or facilitating any activities, business or transaction of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in any Sanctioned Country, or (z) in any manner that would result in the violation of any Sanctions applicable to any party hereto.Section 2.15    Pro Rata Treatment.(a)    All fundings, continuations and conversions of Loans shall be made by the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their Ratable Share (in the case of the initial making of the Loans) or on the basis of their respective outstanding Loans (in the case of continuations and conversions of the Loans), as the case may be from time to time.  All payments on account of principal of or interest on any Loans, fees or any other Obligations owing to or for the account of any one or more Lenders shall be apportioned 31ratably among such Lenders in proportion to the amounts of such principal, interest, fees or other Obligations owed to them respectively.(b)    If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other Obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender’s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such Obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this Section 2.15(b) shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or Participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 2.15(b) shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.  If under any Debtor Relief Law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 2.15(b) applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this Section 2.15(b) to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.Section 2.16    Increased Costs; Change in Circumstances; Illegality; etc.(a)    If any Change in Law shall:(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender;(ii)    subject any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any LIBOR Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes, any Tax described in subsection (ii) through (iv) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and Connection Income Taxes); or(iii)    impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Loans made by such Lender or participation therein;32and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any LIBOR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) in an amount deemed by such Lender as material, then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.(b)    If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.(c)    A certificate of a Lender setting forth such Lender’s good faith determination in reasonable detail of the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Sections 2.16(a) or 2.16(b) and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within twenty (20) days after receipt thereof.(d)    Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.16 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.16 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six (6) months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).(e)    If, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period, (y) the Administrative Agent shall have determined that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period or (z) the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from the Required Lenders of their determination that the rate of interest referred to in the definition of “LIBOR Rate” upon the basis of which the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period is to be determined will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining LIBOR Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders.  Upon such notice, (i) all then outstanding LIBOR Loans shall automatically, on the expiration date of the respective Interest Periods applicable thereto (unless then repaid in full), be converted into Base Rate Loans, (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, to convert Base Rate Loans into, or to continue, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended (including pursuant to the 33Borrowing to which such Interest Period applies), and (iii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given at any time thereafter with respect to LIBOR Loans shall be deemed to be a request for Base Rate Loans, in each case until the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, as the case may be, shall have determined that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist (and the Required Lenders, if making such determination, shall have so notified the Administrative Agent), and the Administrative Agent shall have so notified the Borrower and the Lenders.(f)    Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if, at any time after the date hereof and from time to time, any Lender shall have determined in good faith that the introduction of or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance with any guideline or request from any such Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), has or would have the effect of making it unlawful for such Lender to make or to continue to make or maintain LIBOR Loans, such Lender will forthwith so notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in writing.  Upon such notice, (i) each of such Lender’s then outstanding LIBOR Loans shall automatically, on the expiration date of the respective Interest Period applicable thereto (or, to the extent any such LIBOR Loan may not lawfully be maintained as a LIBOR Loan until such expiration date, upon such notice) and to the extent not sooner prepaid, be converted into a Base Rate Loan, (ii) the obligation of such Lender to make, to convert Base Rate Loans into, or to continue, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended (including pursuant to any Borrowing for which the Administrative Agent has received a Notice of Borrowing but for which the Borrowing Date has not arrived), and (iii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given at any time thereafter with respect to LIBOR Loans shall, as to such Lender, be deemed to be a request for a Base Rate Loan, in each case until such Lender shall have determined that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist and shall have so notified the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall have so notified the Borrower.(g)    Effect of Benchmark Transition Event.(i)    Benchmark Replacement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Credit Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement in writing to replace the LIBOR Rate with a Benchmark Replacement.  Any such amendment by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.  Any such amendment with respect to an Early Opt-in Election will become effective on the date that Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders accept such amendment.  No replacement of LIBOR with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 2.16(g) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.34(ii)     Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes.  In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Credit Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.(iii)     Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date and Benchmark Transition Start Date, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes and (iv) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period.  Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.16(g), including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.16(g).(iv)     Benchmark Unavailability Period.  Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Borrowing of a LIBOR Loan, conversion to or continuation of LIBOR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans.

As used in this Section 2.16(g):“Benchmark Replacement” means the sum of: (a) the alternate benchmark rate (which may include Term SOFR) that has been selected by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a replacement rate or the mechanism for determining such a rate by the Relevant Governmental Body or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest as a replacement to LIBOR for U.S. dollar-denominated syndicated credit facilities and (b) the Benchmark Replacement Adjustment; provided that, if the Benchmark Replacement as so determined would be less than zero, the Benchmark Replacement will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement.“Benchmark Replacement Adjustment” means, with respect to any replacement of LIBOR with an Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for each applicable Interest Period, the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) that has been selected by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or 35determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of LIBOR with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement by the Relevant Governmental Body or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of LIBOR with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for U.S. dollar-denominated syndicated credit facilities at such time.“Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes” means, with respect to any Benchmark Replacement, any technical, administrative or operational changes (including changes to the definition of “Base Rate,” the definition of “Interest Period,” timing and frequency of determining rates and making payments of interest and other administrative matters) that the Administrative Agent decides may be appropriate to reflect the adoption and implementation of such Benchmark Replacement and to permit the administration thereof by the Administrative Agent in a manner substantially consistent with market practice (or, if the Administrative Agent decides that adoption of any portion of such market practice is not administratively feasible or if the Administrative Agent determines that no market practice for the administration of the Benchmark Replacement exists, in such other manner of administration as the Administrative Agent decides is reasonably necessary in connection with the administration of this Agreement).“Benchmark Replacement Date” means the earlier to occur of the following events with respect to LIBOR:(1)    in the case of clause (1) or (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Transition Event,” the later of (a) the date of the public statement or publication of information referenced therein and (b) the date on which the administrator of LIBOR permanently or indefinitely ceases to provide LIBOR; or(2)    in the case of clause (3) of the definition of “Benchmark Transition Event,” the date of the public statement or publication of information referenced therein.“Benchmark Transition Event” means the occurrence of one or more of the following events with respect to LIBOR:(1)    a public statement or publication of information by or on behalf of the administrator of LIBOR announcing that such administrator has ceased or will cease to provide LIBOR, permanently or indefinitely, provided that, at the ti

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Credit Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 2.17(d).(e)    The Administrative Agent and each Lender agree to take such actions that are reasonably requested by the Borrower to the extent not inconsistent with the Administrative Agent’s or such Lender’s internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions to assist Borrower, at the sole expense of Borrower, to recover from the relevant Governmental Authority any Indemnified Taxes in respect of which amounts were paid by Borrower pursuant to Sections 2.17(a), 2.17(b) or 2.17(c); provided, however, the Administrative Agent or any such Lender will not be required to take any action that would be materially disadvantageous to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, respectively.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 2.17(e) shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes not expressly required to be provided hereunder that it reasonably deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.(f)    As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment, or other evidence of such payment in Borrower’s possession and reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.(g)    Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such 39payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.17(g)(i)(A), 2.17(g)(i)(B) and 2.17(g)(i)(D)) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.(i)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:(A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;(B)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:(1)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Credit Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Credit Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;(2)    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;(3)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the 40Internal Revenue Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or(4)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W‑8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;(C)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and(D)    if a payment made to a Lender under any Credit Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(f)(i)(D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.41(h)    In addition, each Foreign Lender agrees that from time to time after the Closing Date (or in the case of a Foreign Lender that is an Eligible Assignee, after the date of assignment to such Foreign Lender), when a lapse of time (or change in circumstances) renders the prior forms hereunder obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, such Foreign Lender shall, to the extent permitted under applicable law, deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent new, accurate and complete, originally executed copies of an Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (or any successor or other applicable forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service) or any other form prescribed by applicable law, and if applicable, a new withholding certificate, to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Foreign Lender or the Administrative Agent to an exemption from, or reduction in, United States withholding tax on payments to be made hereunder on any Loan.(i)    For any period of time during which a Foreign Lender has failed to provide the Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to Sections 2.17(g) or 2.17(h) (unless such failure is due to a Change in Law), such Foreign Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 2.17(c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States.(j)    If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by or on behalf of the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid, or caused to be paid, additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall promptly pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by or on behalf of the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (i), in no event will the Administrative Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (j) to the extent the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This Section 2.17(j) shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes not expressly required to be provided hereunder that it reasonably deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.(k)    Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Credit Document.42Section 2.18    Compensation.  The Borrower will compensate each Lender upon written demand for all losses, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund or maintain LIBOR Loans) that such Lender may incur or sustain (i) if for any reason the Borrower does not consummate (other than (x) due to a default by such Lender or (y) in connection with the Borrower’s rights to revoke a request pursuant to Section 2.16(g)(iv)) a Borrowing or continuation of, or conversion into, a LIBOR Loan on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation, (ii) if any repayment, prepayment or conversion of any LIBOR Loan occurs on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a consequence of any assignment made pursuant to Sections 2.19(a)(1) or 2.19(a)(2) or any acceleration of the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 8.2), (iii) if any prepayment of any LIBOR Loan is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the Borrower or (iv) as a consequence of any other failure by the Borrower to make any payments with respect to any LIBOR Loan when due hereunder.  Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Section 2.18 shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded its relevant LIBOR Loan through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such LIBOR Loan, having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period; provided, however, that each Lender may fund its LIBOR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under this Section 2.18.  A certificate made in good faith (which shall be in reasonable detail) showing the bases for the determinations set forth in this Section 2.18 by any Lender as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.18 shall be submitted by such Lender to the Borrower either directly or through the Administrative Agent.  Determinations set forth in any such certificate made in good faith for purposes of this Section 2.18 of any such losses, costs or expenses shall be conclusive absent manifest error.Section 2.19    Replacement of Lenders; Mitigation of Costs.(a)    The Borrower may, at any time at its sole expense and effort, require any Lender (1) that has requested compensation from the Borrower under Sections 2.16(a) or 2.16(b) or payments from the Borrower under Section 2.17, (2) the obligation of which to make or maintain LIBOR Loans has been suspended under Section 2.16(f) or (3) that is a Defaulting Lender, in any case upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.6), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Credit Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations; provided that:(i)    the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.6(b)(iii);(ii)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Credit Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.18) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);43(iii)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a request for compensation under Sections 2.16(a) or 2.16(b) or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and(iv)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable Requirements of Law.A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.(b)    If any Lender requests compensation under Sections 2.16(a) or 2.16(b), or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 2.16(f), then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.16(a), 2.16(b) or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 2.16(f), as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.Section 2.20    Increase in Commitments.(a)    From time to time after the Closing Date but prior to the Termination Date, the Borrower shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, by written notice to and in consultation with the Administrative Agent, to request an increase in the aggregate Commitments (each such requested increase, a “Commitment Increase”), by having one or more existing Lenders increase their respective Commitments then in effect (each, an “Increasing Lender”), by adding as a Lender with a new Commitment hereunder one or more Persons that are not already Lenders (each, an “Additional Lender”), or a combination thereof; provided that (i) any such request for a Commitment Increase shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $2,500,000 in excess thereof, (ii) immediately after giving effect to any Commitment Increase, (y) the aggregate Commitments shall not exceed $125,000,000 and (z) the aggregate of all Commitment Increases effected after the Closing Date shall not exceed $75,000,000, and (iii) no existing Lender shall be obligated to increase its Commitment as a result of any request for a Commitment Increase by the Borrower unless it agrees in its sole discretion to do so.(b)    Each Additional Lender must qualify as an Eligible Assignee (the approval of which by the Administrative Agent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and the Borrower and each Additional Lender shall execute a Lender Joinder Agreement together with all such other documentation as the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may reasonably require, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to evidence the Commitment of such Additional Lender and its status as a Lender hereunder.44(c)    If the aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section 2.20, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective date (the “Commitment Increase Date,” which shall be a Business Day not less than thirty (30) days prior to the Termination Date) and the final allocation of such increase.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Commitment Increase Date.  The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, on behalf of the Lenders, to enter into any amendments to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably deem appropriate to effect such Commitment Increase.(d)    Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Section 2.20 to the contrary, no increase in the aggregate Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall be effective unless:(i)    The Administrative Agent shall have received the following, each dated the Commitment Increase Date and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent:(A)    as to each Increasing Lender, evidence of its agreement to provide a portion of the Commitment Increase, and as to each Additional Lender, a duly executed Lender Joinder Agreement together with all other documentation required by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.20(b);(B)    an instrument, duly executed by the Borrower, acknowledging and reaffirming its obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents to which it is a party;(C)    a certificate of the corporate secretary or an assistant corporate secretary of the Borrower, certifying that the resolutions adopted by the board of directors of the Borrower authorizing the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents to which it is a party, inclusive of the Commitment Increase, have not been rescinded, amended or otherwise modified since the date of their adoption and remain in full force and effect;(D)    a certificate of an Authorized Officer of the Borrower, certifying that (y) as of the Commitment Increase Date, all representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents are true and correct in all material respects, both immediately before and after giving effect to the Commitment Increase and any Loans issued in connection therewith (except to the extent any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, in which case such representation or warranty is true and correct in all material respects, in each case as of such date), and (z) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, both immediately before and after giving effect to such Commitment Increase (including any Loans issued in connection therewith and the application of the proceeds thereof); and(ii)    The conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.2 shall have been satisfied; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to deliver a Notice of Borrowing 45unless Borrower is requesting a Borrowing of Loans in connection with such Commitment Increase.Immediately after the effectiveness of the Commitment Increase, Schedule 1.1 shall automatically be amended to reflect the Commitments of all Lenders after giving effect to the Commitment Increase.Section 2.21    Defaulting Lenders.(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:(i)    Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and in Section 10.5.(ii)    Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 8.3 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:(A)    first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;(B)    second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;(C)    third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement;(D)    fourth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and(E)    fifth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 3.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender.  Any 46payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.(b)    If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; provided further that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.ARTICLE III     CONDITIONS TO EFFECTIVENESS; CONDITIONS OF BORROWINGSection 3.1    Conditions to Effectiveness.

The provisions of this Article IX are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” (or any other similar term) herein or in any other Credit Document with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations under agency doctrine of any applicable 70law.  Instead, such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.Section 9.2    Rights as a Lender.  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.Section 9.3    Exculpatory Provisions.(a)    The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature.

The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to 71have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender.(c)    The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Credit Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.Section 9.4    Reliance by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying in good faith upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely in good faith upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of any Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.Section 9.5    Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Credit Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article IX shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  As between the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agent except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agent.72Section 9.6    Resignation of Administrative Agent.(a)    The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that no such consent shall be required at any time when a Default or Event of Default exists) to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank that (i) is organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof, (ii) has combined capital and surplus of $500,000,000 and (ii) is “well capitalized” under the applicable bank regulatory standard.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above and approved in advance by the Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Credit Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section 9.6.(b)    Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section 9.6).  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, the provisions of this Article IX and Section 10.1 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.Section 9.7    Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not 73taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Credit Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.Section 9.8    No Other Duties, etc.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Arranger shall not have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.Section 9.9    Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the 80extent provided in Section 10.6(d) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.(b)    Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:(i)    (A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to the assigning Lender or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned, and (B) in any case not described in clause (A) above, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $1,000,000, in any case, treating assignments to two or more Approved Funds under common management as one assignment for purposes of the minimum amounts, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);(ii)    each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Commitment and/or Loans assigned;(iii)    no consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by clause (B) of Section 10.6(b)(i) and, in addition(A)    the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (y) a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (x) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof; and(B)    the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of the Commitment if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender;(iv)    the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 for each assignment if the assignee is not a Lender (paid by the Lender or the assignee, except 81to the extent set forth in Section 2.19(a)(i)), and the assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire;(v)    no such assignment shall be made to the Borrower or any Affiliate or Subsidiary thereof; and(vi)    no such assignment shall be made to a natural person.Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 10.6(c), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.16(a), 2.16(b), 2.17, and 10.1 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.  If requested by or on behalf of the assignee, the Borrower, at its own expense, will execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a new Note or Notes to the order of the assignee (and, if the assigning Lender has retained any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder, to the order of the assigning Lender), prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 2.4 as necessary to reflect, after giving effect to the assignment, the Commitments and/or outstanding Loans, as the case may be, of the assignee and (to the extent of any retained interests) the assigning Lender, in substantially the form of Exhibit A; provided that the original Note or Notes being replaced shall promptly be returned to the Borrower for cancellation.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.6(b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 10.6(d).(c)    The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at its address for notices referred to in Schedule 1.1 a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation or revocation or designation of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.(d)    Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any Affiliate or Subsidiary thereof) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans 82owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in Section 10.5(a) and clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 10.5(b) that affects such Participant.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.16(a), 2.16(b) and 2.17 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Sections 2.17(g) and 2.17(h) (it being understood that the documentation required under Sections 2.17(h) and 2.17(h) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 10.6(b); provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.19 as if it were an assignee under Section 10.6(b) and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.16 or 2.17, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.19 with respect to any Participant.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other Obligations under the Credit Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans, or its other obligations under any Credit Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish such Commitment, Loan, or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.(e)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Notes, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.(f)    The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent 83and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act or any state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.(g)    Any Lender or Participant may, in connection with any assignment, participation, pledge or proposed assignment, participation or pledge pursuant to this Section 10.6, disclose to the Eligible Assignee, Participant or pledgee or proposed Eligible Assignee, Participant or pledgee any information relating to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries furnished to it by or on behalf of any other party hereto; provided that such Eligible Assignee, Participant or pledgee or proposed Eligible Assignee, Participant or pledgee agrees in writing for the benefit of the Borrower as a third-party beneficiary of such agreement to keep such information confidential to the same extent required of the Lenders under Section 10.11.Section 10.7    No Waiver.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents are cumulative and in addition to, and not exclusive of, all other rights and remedies available at law, in equity or otherwise.  No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or Event of Default.  No course of dealing between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders or their agents or employees shall be effective to amend, modify or discharge any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or to constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of Default.  No notice to or demand upon the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to exercise any right or remedy or take any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.Section 10.8    Survival.  All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by or on behalf of the Borrower in this Agreement and in the other Credit Documents shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and survive the execution and delivery hereof or thereof and repayment of all Loans, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied.  In addition, notwithstanding anything herein or under applicable law to the contrary, the provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents relating to indemnification or payment of costs and expenses, including, without limitation, the provisions of Sections 2.16(a), 2.16(b), 2.17, and 10.1 and Article IX, shall survive the payment in full of all Loans, the termination of the Commitments, and any termination of this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents or any provision hereof or thereof.Section 10.9    Severability.  To the extent any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by or invalid under the applicable law of any jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity and only in such jurisdiction, without prohibiting or invalidating such provision in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions of this Agreement in any jurisdiction.  Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.9, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.84Section 10.10    Construction.  The headings of the various articles, sections and subsections of this Agreement and the table of contents have been inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions hereof.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and in the other Credit Documents, in the event of any inconsistency or conflict between any provision of this Agreement and any provision of any of the other Credit Documents, the provision of this Agreement shall control.Section 10.11    Confidentiality.  Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates’ respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority with apparent authority to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable Requirements of Law or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Credit Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Credit Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement in writing containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 10.11, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its Obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 10.11 or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any of their respective Affiliates on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree that they will not trade the securities of the Borrower based upon non-public Information that is received by them.  If the Administrative Agent or a Lender is requested or required to disclose any Information under Sections 10.11(b) or 10.11(c), the Administrative Agent or Lender, as applicable, will, to the extent allowed under applicable law, promptly notify Borrower in writing of the terms and circumstances surrounding the request so that Borrower may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.

In the event no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, the Administrative Agent or Lender, as applicable, will furnish only the portion legally required.  For purposes of this Section 10.11, “Information” means all information received from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 10.11 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.85Section 10.12    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
