rate per annum (rounded upward, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100th of 1%) determined by the Administrative Agent to be equal to the LIBOR Rate for such Eurodollar Borrowing in effect for such Interest Period divided by (ii) 1 minus the
Statutory Reserves (if any) for such Eurodollar Borrowing for such Interest Period.

of Pricing Grid.  Administrative Agent shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the

ARTICLE II 
THE LOANS 
SECTION 2.01 Revolving Commitments.  (a) During the Revolving Commitment Period, subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender agrees, severally and not

  -38-




jointly, to make Revolving Loans to Borrower in the aggregate amount up to but not exceeding such Lenders Revolving Commitment. No Lender shall have an obligation to make a Revolving Loan
in excess of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount of Revolving Commitments of all Lenders. Amounts borrowed pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) may be repaid and reborrowed during the Revolving Commitment Period.
 (b) Each Lenders unfunded Revolving Commitment shall terminate immediately and without further action on the Revolving
Commitment Termination Date and all Revolving Loans and all other amounts owed hereunder with respect to the Revolving Loans and the Revolving Commitments shall be paid in full no later than such date. 
(c) The Revolving Loans shall (i) bear interest as provided in Section 2.07 hereof and (ii) be entitled to the
security interests, Collateral and other rights and benefits provided pursuant to the other Loan Documents.  SECTION 2.02
Loans and Borrowings.  (a) Each Loan (other than a Swingline Loan) shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting
of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made shall not in itself relieve any other Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being
understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender).  (b) Subject to Sections 2.11 and 2.12, each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.03. Each
Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan. Each Lender may at its option make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect
the obligation of Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing that, if
made, would result in more than eight Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding hereunder at any one time. For purposes of the foregoing, Borrowings having different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the same date, shall be considered
separate Borrowings.  (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in
an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than $500,000. At the time that each ABR Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than $500,000;
provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing each Swingline Loan shall be not less than $150,000 and if greater than such amount shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $50,000. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
an ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan may be in an aggregate amount, subject in the case of Swingline Loans to the limitations on the amounts thereof set forth in Section 2.17(a), (i) that is equal to the entire unused balance of the
aggregate Revolving Commitments or (ii) that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.18(e).  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Borrower shall not be entitled to request Eurodollar Loans, or to elect to convert or continue, any Borrowing to Eurodollar Loans if the Interest
Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Revolving Commitment Termination Date.  SECTION 2.03 Borrowing
Procedure. To request a Revolving Borrowing, Borrower shall deliver, by hand delivery or facsimile, a duly completed and executed Borrowing Request to the 
  -39-




Administrative Agent (i) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (ii) in
the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall specify the following information in compliance with
Section 2.02:  (a) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing; 
(b) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;  (c) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; 
(d) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by
the definition of the term Interest Period; and  (e) the location and number of Borrowers account to which
funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.04.  If no election as to the
Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one
months duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section 2.03, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lenders Loan to be
made as part of the requested Borrowing.  SECTION 2.04 Funding of Borrowings. 
  (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on
the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders, provided that
Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.17. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of Borrower maintained with the
Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such other account designated by Borrower from time to time, provided that ABR
Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.18(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank. 
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.04(a) and may, in
reliance upon such assumption and in its sole discretion, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to Borrower to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of Borrower, the interest rate applicable to such Borrowing. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such
Borrowing. 
  -40-



SECTION 2.05 Evidence of Debt; Repayment of Loans. 
(a) Promise to Repay. Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
Lender, the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Revolving Commitment Termination Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender, the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the
Revolving Commitment Termination Date and the first day after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least four Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a
Revolving Borrowing is made, Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding.  (b) Lender and Administrative Agent
Records. Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the
Interest Period applicable thereto; (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from Borrower to each Lender hereunder; and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent
hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lenders share thereof. The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to this paragraph shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations therein recorded;
provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligations of Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with their terms. In the event of
any conflict between the records maintained by any Lender and the records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
(c) Promissory Notes. Any Lender by written notice to Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) may request that Loans
made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Revolving Note (in the form of Exhibit M-1) or a Swingline Note (in the form of Exhibit M-2), as applicable,
to evidence such Lenders Loans.  SECTION 2.06 Fees. 
(a) Administrative Agent Fees. Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the administrative fees
payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between Borrower and the Administrative Agent (the Administrative Agent Fees). All Administrative Agent Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available
funds, to the Administrative Agent. Once paid, none of the Administrative Agent Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.  (b) Closing Fee. Borrower agrees to pay on the Closing Date to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender party to this Agreement on the Closing Date, as fee compensation for the
making available of such Lenders Revolving Commitment, a closing fee (the Closing Fee) in an amount equal to (x) in the case of Lenders holding Revolving Commitments as of the Closing Date equal to or greater than
$25,000,000, 0.75% and (y) in the case of all other Lenders, 0.50%, in each case, of the stated principal amount of such Lenders Revolving Commitment. Such Closing Fee will be in all respects fully earned, due and payable on the Closing
Date and non-refundable and non-creditable thereafter. 
  -41-



(c) Revolving Commitment Fee. Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Revolving Commitment Fee Rate per annum on the average daily unused amount of the Revolving Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the Closing
Date to but excluding the Revolving Commitment Termination Date. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears in respect of the Revolving Commitments on the last Business Day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the
Revolving Commitment Termination Date, commencing on September 30, 2014. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding
the last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees with respect to Revolving Commitments, a Revolving Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender (and, so
long as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., or any of its Affiliates are not the only Lenders under this Agreement, the Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose). 
(d) Letter of Credit Fees. Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a
participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Margin used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Borrowings on the average daily amount of such Lenders LC
Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the later of the Revolving Commitment Termination Date and the date on which such Lender
ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at a rate equal to 0.125% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure arising from or related to Letters of Credit issued by it
(excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the later of the Revolving Commitment Termination Date and the date on which there ceases to be any
LC Exposure, as well as such Issuing Banks reasonable standard administrative fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder; provided that notwithstanding
the foregoing no fronting fees shall be payable so long as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., or any of its Affiliates are the only Lenders under this Agreement. Participation fees and fronting fees shall be payable on the last Business Day of March, June,
September and December of each year, commencing on September 30, 2014; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the Revolving Commitment Termination Date and any such fees accruing after the Revolving Commitment Termination Date
shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  SECTION 2.07
Interest on Loans.  (a) ABR Loans. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.07(c), the Loans
comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time. 
(b) Eurodollar Loans. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.07(c), the Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing
shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time. 
(c) Default Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any of the Events of Default set forth in clause (a), (b), (g) or
(h) of Section 8.01 has occurred and is continuing, then the past due amounts hereunder (and on all amounts hereunder upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an 
  -42-




Event of Default under Section 8.01(g) or (h)) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to
(i) in the case of amounts constituting principal of or interest on any Loan, 2.00% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 2.07 or (ii) in the case of any
other amount, 2.00% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in Section 2.07(a) (in either case, the Default Rate).  (d) Interest Payment Dates. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to
Section 2.07(c) shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan or a Swingline Loan without a permanent reduction in Revolving Commitments),
accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor,
accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.  (e) Interest Calculation. All
interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  SECTION 2.08 Termination and Reduction
of Revolving Commitments.  (a) The Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Commitment Termination Date.
 (b) Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Commitments, provided that
(i) each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $1,000,000 and (ii) Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect
to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with this Section 2.08, the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the aggregate Revolving Commitments. 
(c) Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by written notice of any election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments
hereunder not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of such termination or reduction. Each such notice shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered
by Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of another credit facility or the closing of a securities offering or acquisition or sale, in which case such notice may be revoked or the date of such termination delayed
by Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified prepayment date) if such condition is not satisfied. Each such notice shall specify the effective date of such termination or reduction. Promptly following receipt of
any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Any termination or reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be made ratably among the
Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments.  SECTION 2.09 Interest Elections. 
(a) Generally. Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period 
  -43-




as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may
elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding
the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Borrower shall not be entitled to request any conversion or continuation that, if
made, would result in more than ten Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding hereunder at any one time. This Section 2.09 shall not apply to Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued. 
(b) Interest Election Notice. To make an election pursuant to this Section, Borrower shall deliver, by hand delivery or facsimile,
a duly completed and executed Interest Election Request to the Administrative Agent not later than the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if Borrower was requesting a Loan of the Type resulting from such
election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable. Each Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: 
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect
to different portions thereof, or if outstanding Borrowings are being combined, allocation to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each
resulting Borrowing);  (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request,
which shall be a Business Day;  (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar
Borrowing; and  (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable
thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period.  If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months
duration.  Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the
details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing.  (c) Automatic Conversion to ABR
Borrowing. If an Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing is not timely delivered prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to
an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may require, by notice to Borrower, that (i) no outstanding Borrowing may
be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. 
SECTION 2.10 Prepayments of Loans.  (a) Optional Prepayments. Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in part, subject to the requirements of this Section 2.10.

  -44-



(b) Mandatory Prepayments. In the event and on such occasion that the aggregate
Revolving Credit Exposure exceeds the aggregate Revolving Commitments, Borrower shall prepay Revolving Borrowings or Swingline Borrowings (or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit Cash Collateral in an account with the Collateral Agent )
in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.  (c) Notice of Prepayment. Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent
(and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) in writing of any prepayment hereunder by (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days
before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan,
not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of prepayment delivered by Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of
another credit facility or the closing of a securities offering or acquisition or sale, in which case such notice may be revoked or the date of such prepayment delayed by Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified
prepayment date) if such condition is not satisfied. Each such notice shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed
calculation of the amount of such prepayment. Promptly following receipt of any such notice (other than a notice relating solely to Swingline Loans), the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment
of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of a Credit Extension of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each
prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.07. 
SECTION 2.11 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
 (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be final and conclusive absent manifest error) that
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period; or  (b) the
Administrative Agent determines or is advised in writing by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in
such Borrowing for such Interest Period;  then the Administrative Agent shall give written notice thereof to Borrower and the
Lenders as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the
conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing. 
SECTION 2.12 Yield Protection.  (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in, by any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBOR Rate) or any Issuing Bank;

(ii) subject any Lender or any Issuing Bank to any Tax (except for
(A) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 2.15 or (B) any Excluded Tax); or 
(iii) impose on any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting
this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or Letter of Credit or participation therein;  and the result of any of the foregoing
shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or in the case of clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan or to increase the cost to such Lender or such
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or maintaining its obligation to participate in any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank
hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), then, upon request of such Lender or Issuing Bank, Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or
such Issuing Bank, as applicable, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  (b) Capital Requirements.
If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines (in good faith, but in its sole absolute discretion) that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or Issuing Bank or any lending office of such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lenders or Issuing
Banks holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or Issuing Banks capital or on the capital of such Lenders or Issuing Banks
holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Revolving Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level
below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or such Issuing Banks policies and
the policies of such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company for any such reduction suffered.  (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank prepared in good faith setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank
or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.12 and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of such amounts and delivered to Borrower shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall not constitute a waiver of such
Lenders or such Issuing Banks right to demand such compensation; provided that Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or such Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.12 for any increased costs incurred
or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or such Issuing
Banks intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof).

SECTION 2.13 Breakage Payments. In the event of (a) the payment or
prepayment, whether optional or mandatory, of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan earlier than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan
earlier than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan
earlier than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by Borrower pursuant to Section 2.16(b), then, in any such event, Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to equal an amount reasonably determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would
have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the LIBOR Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor
(or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest
rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the Eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any
amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall be delivered to Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error. Borrower shall
pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 5 Business Days after receipt thereof.  SECTION 2.14
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs.  (a) Payments Generally. Borrower shall make each
payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements or of amounts payable under Section 2.12, 2.13, 2.15 or 10.03,
or otherwise) on or before the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date when due, in immediately available
funds, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating
interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 1111 Fannin Street, Houston, Texas, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein. The
Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a
Business Day, unless specified otherwise, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars, except as expressly specified otherwise.  (b) Pro Rata Treatment.
 (1) Each payment by Borrower of interest in respect of the Loans shall be applied to the amounts of such obligations owing to
the Lenders pro rata according to the respective amounts then due and owing to the Lenders.  (2) Each payment on account of
principal of the Loans shall be allocated among the Lenders pro rata based on the principal amount of the Loans held by the Lenders, except with respect to a Disqualified Lender, in which case payment shall be applied solely to such Disqualified
Lenders Loans and not pro rata, subject to any necessary Gaming Approvals. 
  -47-



(3) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section shall be subject to
Section 2.19 to the extent applicable.  (c) Insufficient Funds. If at any time insufficient funds are
received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, toward payment of interest and fees
then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, toward payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties. It is understood that the foregoing does not apply to any adequate protection payments
under any federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding, and that the Administrative Agent may, subject to any applicable federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar orders,
distribute any adequate protection payments it receives on behalf of the Lenders to the Lenders in its sole discretion (i.e., whether to pay the earliest accrued interest, all accrued interest on a pro rata basis or otherwise). 
(d) Sharing of Setoff. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in
respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans or other Obligations resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its
Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon or other Obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall
(a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders,
or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans
and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that: 
(i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and  (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any
payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant.  Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Requirements of Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing
arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation. If under applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or any similar law any Secured Party receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff or counterclaim to which this Section 2.14(d) applies, such Secured Party shall to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in
respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights to which the Secured Party is entitled under this Section 2.14(d) to share in the benefits of the recovery of such secured claim. 
(e) Borrower Default. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment, the Administra-
  -48-




tive Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case
may be, the amount due. In such event, if Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so
distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds
Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.  (f) Lender Default. If any Lender or the Issuing Bank shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(a), 2.14(e) or 10.03(c), then the
Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to satisfy such
Lenders or such Issuing Banks, as the case may be, obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.  SECTION 2.15 Taxes.  (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Unless
required by applicable Law (as determined in good faith by the applicable withholding agent), any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document to any Lender or Agent shall be made
free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes; provided that if any Loan Party or other applicable withholding agent shall be required by Law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum paid or payable by any Loan
Party to any Lender or Agent under any of the Loan Documents, then (i) if the Tax in question is an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after all such required
deductions or withholdings (including such deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15) have been made, each Lender (or, in the case of a payment made to an Agent for its own account, such
Agent), receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) the applicable Loan Party or other applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions or withholdings and
(iii) the applicable Loan Party or other applicable withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law. 
(b) Payment of Other Taxes by Loan Parties. Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the relevant Loan Party
shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law.  (c)
Indemnification by Borrower. The Loan Parties shall, without duplication of additional amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.15(a), indemnify each Agent and Lender (each a Tax Indemnitee), within 10 days after
written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.15) imposed on such Tax
Indemnitee by any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, regardless of whether such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed, asserted or otherwise determined to be payable by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate, prepared in good faith, as to the amount of such payment or liability and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of
such payment or liability delivered to Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) by the Tax Indemnitee or by an Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of another Tax Indemnitee, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  -49-



(d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of any Taxes by
any Loan Party that such Loan Party is required to pay pursuant to this Section 2.15, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority
evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.  (e) Status of Lenders. Each Lender shall, at the time or times prescribed by applicable Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent, provide Borrower
and the Administrative Agent with any documentation prescribed by Law, or reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent, certifying as to any entitlement of such Lender to an exemption from, or reduction in, any applicable withholding
Tax with respect to any payments to be made to such Lender under the Loan Documents. Each such Lender shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders any such documentation (including any specific documentation referenced below in
this Section 2.15(e)) expired, obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, or upon the reasonable request of Borrower or the Administrative Agent, deliver promptly to Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate
documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent) or promptly notify Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing if such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver such documentation
under applicable Law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: 
(i) Each Lender that is a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall
deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that
such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding.  (ii) Each Foreign Lender shall deliver to Borrower
and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement whichever of the following is applicable:  (I) two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or any successor forms) claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United
States of America is a party,  (II) two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any
successor forms),  (III) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio
interest under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate, in substantially the form of Exhibit P (any such certificate a United States Tax Compliance Certificate), to the effect that such
Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a
controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, and that no payments in connection with the Loan Documents are effectively connected with such Foreign Lenders conduct of a U.S. trade or business
and (y) two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or any successor forms), 
  -50-



(IV) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner (for
example, where the Foreign Lender is a partnership, or is a Foreign Lender that has transferred its beneficial ownership to a participant), Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms) of the Foreign Lender, accompanied by an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Internal Revenue Service W-8BEN, Internal Revenue Service W-8BEN-E, United States Tax Compliance Certificate, Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8IMY (or other successor forms) or any other required information from each beneficial owner, as applicable (provided that, if the Foreign Lender is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and
one or more direct or indirect partners are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, the United States Tax Compliance Certificate may be provided by such Foreign Lender on behalf of such partner(s)), or 
(V) two copies of any other form prescribed by applicable requirements of U.S. federal income tax Law as a basis for
claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax on any payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents, duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable requirements of Law to
permit Borrower and the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. 
(iii) If a payment made to any Lender or the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document would be subject to United
States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender or the Administrative Agent were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) and 1472(b) of the Code, as
applicable), such Lender and the Administrative Agent shall deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by Borrower and/or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable Law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Borrower or the Administrative Agent to comply with its
obligations under FATCA, to determine whether such Lender or the Administrative Agent has complied with its obligations under FATCA and to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause (e), a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form that such Lender is not legally
eligible to deliver.  (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If and to the extent that a Tax Indemnitee determines, in good
faith and in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 2.15, then such Tax Indemnitee shall pay to Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 2.15 with
respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such Tax Indemnitee and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund net of any Taxes payable by any Tax Indemnitee); provided that the applicable Loan Party, upon the request of the Tax Indemnitee, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any
penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Tax Indemnitee in the event such Tax Indemnitee is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section 2.15(f) shall not
be construed to require any Tax Indemnitee to make available its Tax Returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other person. 
  -51-



(g) Definition of Lender. For the avoidance of doubt, the term Lender
shall, for purposes of this Section 2.15, include any Issuing Bank and any Swingline Lender.  SECTION 2.16
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender
requests compensation under Section 2.12, or requires Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall use
reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such
designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and
would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. A certificate setting forth such costs and expenses
submitted by such Lender to Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any
Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, or if Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, or if any Lender is
a Defaulting Lender or if Borrower exercises its replacement rights under Section 10.02(d), then Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and
delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an
Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:  (i) Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the processing and recordation fee specified in Section 10.04(b); 
(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon,
accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.13 from the assignee or Borrower); 
(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.12 or payments required to be
made pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and  (iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Requirements of Law, including any Gaming Laws.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Borrower to require such
assignment and delegation cease to apply.  Each Lender agrees that, if Borrower elects to replace such Lender in accordance
with this Section 2.16(b), it shall promptly execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption to evidence the assignment and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Note (if Notes have been issued in
respect of such Lenders Loans) subject to such Assignment and Assumption; provided that the failure of any such Lender to execute an Assignment and Assumption shall not render such assignment invalid and such assignment shall be
recorded in the Register. 
  -52-



SECTION 2.17 Swingline Loans. 
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to Borrower from time to
time during the Revolving Commitment Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $7.5 million or (ii) the sum of the
total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeding the total Revolving Commitments; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject
to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.  (b) To request a
Swingline Loan, Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time), on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and
shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall
make each Swingline Loan available to Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of Borrower with the Swingline Lender or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such other account as Borrower may request from time to
time (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.18(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m. (New York City time), on the requested date of such
Swingline Loan.  (c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m.
(New York City time), on any Business Day require the Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Lenders
will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Lender, specifying in such notice such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a
Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.04 or with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.04 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the
Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this
paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from Borrower (or other party on behalf of Borrower) in
respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly
remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the
Swingline 
  -53-




Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan
pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.  SECTION 2.18 Letters of
Credit.  (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Borrower may request the issuance of
Letters of Credit as the applicant thereof for the support of its or its Restricted Subsidiaries obligations, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the
Revolving Commitment Period, and the Issuing Bank agrees to issue Letters of Credit requested in accordance with this Section 2.18. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and
conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by Borrower to, or entered into by Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
 (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of
Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing
Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, but in any event no less than three Business Days or such shorter period as is acceptable to the Issuing Bank) a notice
requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such
Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend,
renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by Issuing Bank, Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Banks standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall
be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $7.5 million and (ii) the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the total Revolving Commitments. 
(c) Expiration Date. Maturities for Letter of Credit shall not exceed twelve months (in the case of standby Letters of Credit) or
180 days (in the case of trade Letters of Credit), renewable automatically annually thereafter in the case of standby Letters of Credit. All Letters of Credit shall expire no later than the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving
Commitment Termination Date (such date, the Letter of Credit Expiration Date), unless Borrower agrees, at the time Borrower requests any such Letter of Credit expiring later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, to Cash
Collateralize such Letter of Credit on the Business Day prior to the Letter of Credit Expiration Date or all the Lenders have approved such expiry date.  (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the
Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn
under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lenders Applicable
Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to Borrower for any reason.

Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be
affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment shall
be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank
shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, (i) two
Business Days after Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received by Borrower prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (ii) three Business Days after Borrower received such notice, if such notice is
not received prior to such time; provided that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000, Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.17 that such payment
be financed with a Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Swingline Loan. If Borrower fails to make such payment when
due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from Borrower in respect thereof and such Lenders Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.04 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.04 shall
apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of
any payment from Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such
Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not
constitute a Loan and shall not relieve Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.  (f) Obligations
Absolute. Borrowers obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a
Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other
document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or
equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, Borrowers obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by
reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical
terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to
special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by Borrower to the extent permitted by 
  -55-




applicable law) suffered by Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Banks failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit
comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be
deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial
compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the
contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.  (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing
Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to
give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.  (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid
amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; provided
that, if Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.07(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing
Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. 
(i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, Borrower shall
pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.07(d). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and
obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing
Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and
obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. 
(j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that Borrower receives
notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant
to this paragraph, Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid
interest on unreimbursed LC Disbursements; provided that the obligation to de-
  -56-




posit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default with respect to Borrower described in Section 8.01(g) or (h). Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of Borrower under this
Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the
option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at Borrowers risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of Borrower for the LC
Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of Borrower under
this Agreement. If Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to Borrower within three Business
Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.  (k) Additional Issuing Banks. Borrower may at any time, and
from time to time, designate one or more additional Lenders to act as an issuing bank under this Agreement with the consent of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and such Lender. Any Lender designated as an issuing bank
pursuant to this Section 2.18(k) shall be deemed to be and shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank hereunder.  SECTION 2.19 Defaulting Lenders.  (a) Defaulting Lender
Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
 (i) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment,
waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.  (ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or
mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the
Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to
any Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure pursuant to Section 2.19(d); fourth, as Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default
exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative
Agent and Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the
Issuing Banks future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.19(d); sixth, to the payment of any amounts
owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or Swingline Lenders as 
  -57-




a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Banks or Swingline Lenders against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting
Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained
by Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;
provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or LC Disbursements in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the
related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LC Disbursements owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on
a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LC Disbursements owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans, LC Exposure and funded and unfunded participations in Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders
pro rata in accordance with the Revolving Commitments without giving effect to Section 2.19(b). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a
Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.19(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
(iii) Certain Fees.  (I) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Revolving Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee
that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).  (II) Each Defaulting
Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided
Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.19(d).  (III) With respect to any other fees required to be
paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (II) above, Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure
or participation in Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to each Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to
such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Banks or Swingline Lenders Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. 
(iv) Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders
LC Exposure or participation in Swingline Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment) but
only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, Borrower shall be deemed
to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders
Revolving Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting
Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation. 
  -58-



(v) Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Loans. If the
reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal
to the Swingline Lenders Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.19(d). 
(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If Borrower, Administrative Agent and each Swingline Lender and Issuing Bank agree in writing that a
Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with
respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the
Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Revolving Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.19(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender
will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further,
that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a
Defaulting Lender.  (c) New Swingline Loans/Letters of Credit. So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender,
(i) the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swingline Loan and (ii) no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue,
extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.  (d) Cash Collateral. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within three Business Days following the written request of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent) Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.19(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such
Defaulting Lender) in an amount equal to the Collateral Amount.  (i) Grant of Security Interest.
Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grant to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Banks, and agree to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash
Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of LC Exposure, to be applied pursuant to clause (ii) below. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject
to any prior right or claim of any person other than the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Collateral Amount, Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the
Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). 
(ii) Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided
under this Section 2.19(d) or Section 2.19(a) in respect of Letters 
  -59-




of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of LC Exposure (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a
Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein. 
(iii) Termination of Requirement. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce any
Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.19(d) following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of
Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to Section 2.19(a), the person
providing Cash Collateral and each Issuing Bank may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations and provided, further, that to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided
by Borrower, such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Security Documents. 
ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  Each Loan Party represents and warrants to
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each of the Lenders that:  SECTION 3.01 Organization; Powers.
Each Company (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the corporate, limited liability company or other organizational power and authority, and the legal
right, to own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or limited liability company and in good standing
under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except to the extent the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law, except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.  SECTION 3.02 Authorization; Enforceability. 
(a) Each Loan Party has the corporate, limited liability company or other organizational power and authority, and the legal right, to
execute, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to carry out the transactions contemplated thereby and, in the case of Borrower, to borrow and issue Indebtedness hereunder and under the Financing Agreements. Each Loan
Party has taken all necessary corporate, limited liability company or other organizational action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents and the Financing Agreements to which it is a party and, in the case of
Borrower, to authorize the borrowings and issuances of Indebtedness on the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Financing Agreements.  (b) Each Loan Document and Financing Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of each Loan Party party thereto. This Agreement constitutes, and each other Loan Document and Financing
Agreement upon execution by all parties thereto will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Loan Party party thereto, enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).

SECTION 3.03 No Consents; No Conflicts; No Defaults. 
(a) No material consent or material authorization of, material filing with, material notice to or other act b

y Requirement of Law, including any Gaming Law, (ii) any Contractual Obligation of any Loan Party or (iii) the Organizational Documents of any Loan Party, except in
the cases of clauses (i) and (ii), to the extent that any such violations, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition
of any Lien on any of their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any material Requirement of Law or any such Contractual Obligation (other than the Liens created, or permitted to be incurred, by the Security Documents). 
(c) As of the Closing Date, no Loan Party is in default in any material respect under or with respect to any Material Agreement. No Loan
Party is in default in any material respect under or with respect to any Affiliate Document.  SECTION 3.04 Financial
Statements; Projections.  (a) Historical Financial Statements. The audited consolidated balance sheets of
Holdings and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the fiscal year ended on such date, reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, present fairly in all
material respects the consolidated financial condition of Holdings and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated results of Holdings and its consolidated Subsidiaries operations and consolidated cash flows for such
fiscal year. The unaudited consolidated balance sheets of Holdings and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at June 30, 2014, and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the six-month period ended on such date,
present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial condition of Holdings and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated results of Holdings and its consolidated Subsidiaries operations and consolidated
cash flows for the six-month period then ended (subject to normal year end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes and except for impairment charges related to the assets held for sale). Except as noted in the preceding sentence, all such
financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved, except as noted therein. 
(b) No Liabilities. Other than as disclosed on Schedule 3.04(b), as of the Closing Date, the Loan Parties do not have any
material Contingent Obligations, material contingent liabilities or 
  -61-




liabilities for Taxes, or any long term leases or unusual forward or long term commitments, including, without limitation, any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transactions or
other obligations in respect of derivatives, that are not reflected in the most recent financial statements referred to in this Section 3.04, except for the Obligations. 
(c) No Material Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2013, there have been no developments or events that, individually or in
the aggregate, have resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  (d)
Projections. The projections, forward-looking statements, estimates and pro forma financial information contained in this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other document, certificate or statement furnished to the Agents, the
Arranger or the Lenders (including, without limitation, the Projections) are based upon good faith estimates and assumptions believed by Borrower to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by the Agents, the Arranger and the Lenders that
such projections, forward-looking statements, estimates and pro forma financial information are not to be viewed as facts and are subject to material contingencies and assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of the Loan Parties, and that
actual results during the period or periods covered by any such projections, forward-looking statements, estimates and pro forma financial information may differ materially from the projected results. 
SECTION 3.05 Properties.  (a) Generally. The Loan Parties are the sole owners of, and have legal title to, or a valid right to use, all of their property necessary to the operation of their businesses, and none of such
property is subject to any claims, liabilities, obligations, charges or restrictions of any kind, nature or description (other than claims, liabilities, obligations, charges or restrictions that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect) or to any Lien, other than Permitted Liens.  (b) Real Property.
 (i) As of the Closing Date, Schedule 3.05(b)(i) sets forth a true, complete and correct list of all Real Property,
including a brief description thereof. Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent true, complete and correct copies of all such leases as in effect on the Closing Date.  (ii) Assuming completion of the Project, all Real Property and the current use thereof comply with all applicable Requirements of Law (including applicable building and zoning ordinances and codes) and
with all Insurance Requirements, and none of the Loan Parties are non-conforming users of such Real Property, except, in each case, where noncompliance or such non-conforming use would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.  (iii) No Taking has been commenced with respect to all or any portion of any Real
Property or for the relocation of roadways providing access to such Real Property, except, in each case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 
(iv) Except for those disclosed in the Title Policies or as set forth on Schedule 3.05(b)(iv), as of the Closing Date
(x) 

).  (viii)(A) Other than exceptions to any of the following that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, as of the Closing Date,
(i) all utility services necessary for the current state of construction of the Project are available, including, without limitation, public sanitary sewer service and storm sewers, public water, electricity, gas and telephone service, and
(ii) all permits and approvals have been obtained or are available so that the Improvements may be hooked up to the public sanitary sewer service, which public sanitary sewer service shall be available to the full extent required for the full
operation of the Project and shall permit the discharge of sewage for the types and amounts anticipated to be produced from the Project. Other than exceptions to any of the following that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, after the Closing Date, Borrower reasonably expects to have all utilities available, as and when necessary, to complete the construction of the Improvements. 
(B) Other than exceptions to any of the following that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, Borrower reasonably expects that as of the Opening Date, all public sanitary sewer service and storm sewers necessary for the full operation of the Project will be available at the title lines of the Land (or, if they pass
through adjoining private land, in accordance with valid public or unencumbered private easements which inure to the benefit of Borrower and any applicable Loan Parties and run with the Land, copies of which have been delivered to the Administrative
Agent).  (C) As of the date of the initial Credit Extension, the Project shall have all hot and chilled water for purposes of
heating and air conditioning, electricity, and gas services necessary for the operation of the Project at the title lines of the Land (or, if they pass through adjoining private or public land, in accordance with valid public or unencumbered private
easements or licenses which inure to the benefit of Borrower and any applicable Loan Parties and run with the Land, copies of which have been delivered to the Administrative Agent). 
  -63-



(ix) As of the Closing Date, all roads necessary for the utilization of the Real Property
related to the Project Site for its current and intended purposes are indicated on the Survey and provide adequate public access to the Project Site for its current and intended purposes. 
(x) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, no building or
structure constituting Real Property or any appurtenance thereto or equipment thereon, or the use, operation or maintenance thereof, violates any restrictive covenant affecting such Real Property or encroaches on any easement or on any property
owned by others.  (c) Landmark Status. The Real Property and the site conditions thereof are not preserved as landmarks
or historic sites in such way that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Real Property.  (d)
Project Property. The Real Property set forth on Schedule 3.05(d) constitutes all of the real property currently owned or leased by the Loan Parties and used in the development of the Project, and no other Real Property is necessary to
complete the development of the Project and begin operations.  SECTION 3.06 Intellectual Property. 
(a) Ownership No Claims. Each Loan Party owns, or is licensed or otherwise has the right to use, all Intellectual Property that is
material to the conduct of its business as currently conducted except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. As of the Closing Date, no claim has been asserted or is pending by any person challenging the use of
any such Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual Property within the past three (3) years, nor as of the Closing Date does Borrower know of any valid basis for any such claim, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Borrower, the use by each Loan Party of the Intellectual Property that is material to the conduct of its business as currently
conducted, does not infringe on the rights of any person, which infringement, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 
(b) Trademarks. As of the Closing Date, Schedule 3.06(b) (i) identifies each of the registrations and pending
applications for material trademarks, service-marks and trade names currently registered by, made by or otherwise held by the Loan Parties (other than Excluded Property) and identifies which such person registered, made or otherwise holds, or filed
an application with respect to, such Intellectual Property and (ii) specifies as to each, the jurisdiction in which such Intellectual Property has been issued or registered (or, if applicable, in which an application for such issuance or
registration has been filed), including the respective registration or application numbers and applica

ntellectual Property has been issued or
registered (or, if applicable, in which an application for such issuance or registration has been filed), including the respective registration or application numbers and applicable dates of registration or application and expiration. 
(e) Licenses. As of the Closing Date, Schedule 3.06(e) identifies all licenses, sublicenses and other agreements relating to
Intellectual Property (excluding Intellectual Property available on a commercial basis in the ordinary course) to which any of the Loan Parties is a party that are material to the conduct of such persons business and pursuant to which

connection with any Real Property (including, as necessary under Environmental Law, asbestos surveys and abatement and/or groundwater investigation and remediation), and comply as required with all Environmental Laws governing any Real Property or
the improvements thereon.  (c) The Administrative Agent may (but shall not be required to) at Borrowers expense, at any
time that the Administrative Agent has a reasonable basis to believe that (i) a Release of Hazardous Materials has occurred at, on or under any Real Property or (ii) there has been a violation of Environmental Law in connection with any
Real Property that, in each case, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (A) retain an independent professional consultant to review any environmental audits, investigations, analyses and reports relating to Hazardous

cooperate with Borrower concerning such review and/or investigation. The Administrative Agent shall share the results of such investigation with Borrower and shall provide copies of associated reports to Borrower and provide Borrower with the
reasonable opportunity to participate in any sampling investigation, including the right to take split or other verification samples. Any such investigation shall be conducted, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Borrower and the Administrative
Agent, during normal business hours and shall be conducted so as not to unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations at such Real Property or the Project or cause any damage or loss to any property at such Real Property or the Project. Any
report of any investigation conducted at the request of the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 5.09 will be obtained and shall be used by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders solely for the purposes of the Lenders
internal credit decisions, to monitor and police the Loans and to protect the Lenders security interests, if any, created by the Loan Documents, and except as may be required by applicable law and subject to any independent legal obligations
of the independent professional consultant, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall confer with, make filings to or otherwise correspond with any Governmental Authority with respect to or relating to such sampling or investigation
without the reasonable consent of, or participation by, Borrower; provided, however, should any such investigation conducted at the request of the Administrative Agent confirm a Release of Hazardous Materials at, on, under or from any
Real Property, Borrower shall, at Borrowers sole cost and expense without prejudice to Borrowers right to assert any claims against any Governmental Authority or other person, if and to the extent required under Environmental Law,
undertake to remediate such Release and shall otherwise comply with any Environmental Law with respect to such Release.

insufficient to justify the difficulty, time and/or expense of taking such actions or obtaining such insurance or (ii) deliver a Phase I Report with respect to any fee, easement or other interest in real property acquired after the Closing Date
to the extent the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion has determined that the size, location and proposed use thereof are insufficient to justify the time and expense of obtaining such reports. Additionally, to the extent any such
acquisition relates to Real Property, the definitions, exhibits and schedules to this Agreement and any other Loan Document related to descriptions of Real Property shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to reflect such acquisition (and the
Administrative Agent is authorized to execute written amendments to such Loan Documents in connection therewith).  SECTION
5.11 Security Interests; Further Assurances. From time to time execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional instruments, certificates or documents, and take all such actions, as the Administrative Agent may
deem necessary or desirable for the continued validity, perfection and priority of the Lien of the Collateral Agent on the Collateral (or with respect to any additions thereto or replacements or proceeds or products thereof which do not constitute
Excluded Property, Excluded Real Property or other property with respect to which the Loan Documents do not require the Collateral Agent to have a security interest) pursuant hereto or thereto. Upon the exercise by the Administrative Agent,
Collateral Agent or any Secured Party of any power, right, privilege or remedy 
  -84-




pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents which requires any consent, approval, recording, qualification or authorization of any Governmental Authority following the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, Borrower shall, or shall cause any other applicable Loan Party to, execute and deliver, or will cause the execution and delivery of, all applications, certifications, instruments and other documents and
papers that the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or such Secured Party may be required to obtain from Borrower or the applicable Loan Party for such governmental consent, approval, recording, qualification or authorization. In the event that a
Lien not otherwise permitted under this Agreement shall encumber the Mortgaged Property, any other item of Collateral or any portion thereof (or a mechanics or materialmens claim of lien shall be filed or otherwise asserted against the
Mortgaged Property, any other item of Collateral or any portion thereof), the relevant Loan Party shall promptly discharge or cause to be discharged by payment to the lienor or lien claimant or promptly secure removal by bonding or deposit with the
county clerk or otherwise or, at the Administrative Agents option, and if obtainable promptly obtain title insurance against, any such Lien or mechanics or materialmens claims of lien filed or otherwise asserted against the
Mortgaged Property or such other item of Collateral or any portion thereof within 30 days after the date of notice thereof (which period the Administrative Agent may extend in its sole discretion so long as the relevant Loan Party is diligently
pursuing such actions); provided, that the provisions of this Section 5.11 (and compliance therewith) shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any of the provisions of Section 6.02. Each of the Loan Parties shall
fully preserve the Lien and the priority (subject to Permitted Liens) of each of the Mortgages and the other Security Documents without cost or expense to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Secured Parties. If any Loan Party fails
to promptly discharge, remove or bond off any Lien on the Collateral which is not a Permitted Lien and which is not being contested by the applicable Loan Party in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted,
within 60 days after the receipt of notice thereof from the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, procure the release and discharge of such Lien, and in furtherance thereof may, in its sole
discretion, effect any settlement or compromise with the lienor or lien claimant or post any bond or furnish any security or indemnity as the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, may elect. In settling, compromising or arranging for the
discharge of any Liens or claims of Liens under this Section 5.11, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to establish or confirm the validity or amount of the Lien or the claim. Borrower agrees that all costs and expenses
reasonably expended or otherwise incurred pursuant to this Section 5.11 (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party shall constitute Obligations and
shall be paid by Borrower in accordance with the terms hereof.  SECTION 5.12 Information Regarding Collateral.

Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent prior written notice of its intention so to do, clearly describing such change and providing such other information in connection therewith as the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent may
reasonably request and (B) it shall have taken all action reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent to maintain the perfection and priority of the security interest of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties in the
Collateral, if applicable. Each Loan Party agrees to promptly provide the Collateral Agent with certified Organizational Documents reflecting any of the changes described in the preceding sentence. 
(b) Concurrently with the delivery of financial statements pursuant to Section 5.01(a), deliver to the Administrative Agent

certificate delivered pursuant to this Section 5.12(b).  SECTION 5.13 Compliance with Laws, etc.;
Permits.  (a) Comply with all Requirements of Law, noncompliance with which would, individually or in the aggregate,

Unrestricted Subsidiary if it was previously designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The designation of any Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall constitute an Investment by Borrower therein at the date of designation in an amount equal to
the fair market value of Borrowers (as applicable) investment therein without duplication in the case of Subsidiaries of persons designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. The designation of any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary
shall constitute (i) the incurrence at the time of designation of any Indebtedness or Liens of such Subsidiary existing at such time and (ii) a return on and payment in respect of any Investment by Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary in
Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the preceding sentence in an amount equal to the fair market value at the date of such designation of Borrowers and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as applicable) Investment in such Subsidiary.

granted by such Restricted Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries under the applicable Security Documents shall terminate and be released and be of no further force and effect, and all Liens on the Equity Interests of such Restricted Subsidiary and its

the Collateral Agent will execute and deliver any instrument evidencing such termination and the Collateral

ARTICLE VII  GUARANTEE  SECTION 7.01 The Guarantee. The Guarantors hereby
jointly and severally guarantee, as a primary obligor and not as a surety to each Secured Party and their respective successors and assigns, the prompt payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration,
demand, by acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest (including any interest, fees, costs or charges that would accrue but for the provisions of the Title 11 of the United States Code after any bankruptcy or insolvency petition
under Title 11 of the United States Code) on the Loans made by the Lenders to, and the Notes held by each Lender of, Borrower, and all other Secured Obligations from time to time owing to the Secured Parties by any Loan Party under any Loan Document
or any Hedging Agreement or Treasury Services Agreement entered into with a counterparty that is a Secured Party, in each case strictly in accordance with the terms thereof, in each case excluding any Excluded Swap Obligation (such obligations,
excluding any Excluded Swap Obligation, being herein collectively called the Guaranteed Obligations). The Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree that if Borrower or other Guarantor(s) shall fail to pay in full when due
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Guarantors will promptly pay the same in cash, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or
renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal. 
SECTION 7.02 Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 7.01 shall constitute a
guaranty of payment and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, are absolute, irrevocable and unconditional, joint and several, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the
Guaranteed Obligations of Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes, if any, or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, and, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or Guarantor (except for payment in full). Without limiting the 
  -103-




generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of the Guarantors hereunder which shall remain absolute,
irrevocable and unconditional under any and all circumstances as described above:  (i) at any time or from time
to time, without notice to the Guarantors, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived; 
(ii) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or any other agreement or
instrument referred to herein or therein shall be done or omitted;  (iii) the maturity of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be amended in any respect, or any right under the Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be amended or waived in any
respect or any other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with; 
(iv) any Lien or security interest granted to, or in favor of, any Lender, the Issuing Bank or Agent as security for any
of the Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be perfected; or  (v) the release of any other Guarantor pursuant
to Section 7.09.  The Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all
notices whatsoever, and any requirement that any Secured Party exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against Borrower under this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or against
any other person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantors waive any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension, waiver, termination or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and
notice of or proof of reliance by any Secured Party upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee, and the Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon this
Guarantee, and all dealings between Borrower and the Secured Parties shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee. This Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute, irrevocable
and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to any right of offset with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations at any time or from time to time held by Secured Parties, and the obligations and liabilities of the Guarantors hereunder shall
not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by the Secured Parties or any other person at any time of any right or remedy against Borrower or against any other person which may be or become liable in respect of all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations or against any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto. This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon the
Guarantors and the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of the Lenders, and their respective successors and assigns.  SECTION 7.03 Reinstatement. The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article VII shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or
on behalf of Borrower or other Loan Party in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization
or otherwise.  SECTION 7.04 Subrogation; Subordination. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that until the indefeasible
payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations and the expi- 
  -104-




ration and termination of the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders under this Agreement it shall waive any claim and shall not exercise any right or remedy, direct or indirect, arising by reason
of any performance by it of its guarantee in Section 7.01, whether by subrogation or otherwise, against Borrower or any other Guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, except as
provided in Section 7.12 hereof. Any Indebtedness of any Loan Party permitted pursuant to Section 6.01(b) shall be subordinated to such Loan Partys Secured Obligations in the manner set forth in the Intercompany Note
evidencing such Indebtedness.  SECTION 7.05 Remedies. The Guarantors jointly and severally agree that, as
between the Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes, if any, may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 8.01 (and shall be deemed to have become automatically
due and payable in the circumstances provided in Section 8.01) for purposes of Section 7.01, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming
automatically due and payable) in connection with the proceeding referenced in Section 8.01(g) or (h) as against Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become
automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section 7.01. 
SECTION 7.06 Instrument for the Payment of Money. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the guarantee in this Article
VII constitutes an instrument for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that any Lender or Agent, at its sole option, in the event of a dispute by such Guarantor in the payment of any moneys due hereunder, shall have the right to bring a
motion-action under New York CPLR Section 3213.  SECTION 7.07 Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee in this
Article VII is a continuing guarantee of payment, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising. 
SECTION 7.08 General Limitation on Guarantee Obligations. In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate limited
partnership or limited liability company law, or any applicable state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under
Section 7.01 would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section 7.01, then,
notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Guarantor, any Loan Party or any other person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount (after giving
effect to the right of contribution established in Section 7.10) that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding. 
SECTION 7.09 Release of Guarantors. If, in compliance with the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents, (i) the
Equity Interests of any Guarantor are sold or otherwise transferred such that such Guarantor no longer constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary (a Transferred Guarantor) to a person or persons, none of which is Borrower or a Restricted
Subsidiary, such Transferred Guarantor shall, upon the consummation of such sale or transfer, be, and (ii) any Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, such Subsidiary be automatically released from its obligations
under this Agreement (including under Section 10.03 hereof) and its obligations to pledge and grant any Collateral owned by it pursuant to any Security Document and the pledge of such Equity Interests to the Collateral Agent pursuant to
the Security Agreement shall be automatically released, and, so long as Borrower shall have provided the Agents such certifications or documents as any Agent shall reasonably request, the Collateral Agent shall take such actions as are necessary to
effect each release described in this Section 7.09 in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Security Documents, so long as Borrower shall have provided the Agents such certifications or documents as any Agent shall reasonably
request in order to demonstrate compliance with this Agreement. 
  -105-



SECTION 7.10 Right of Contribution. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the
extent that a Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its
proportionate share of such payment; provided, that such right of contribution shall not apply with respect to any Excluded Swap Obligation. Each Guarantors right of contribution shall be subject to the terms and conditions of
Section 7.04. The provisions of this Section 7.10 shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders, and each Guarantor shall remain
liable to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders for the full amount of Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder.  SECTION 7.11 Nevada Specific Provisions and Waivers. In the event of any inconsistencies between the other terms and conditions of Article VII and this Section 7.11, the
terms and conditions of this Section 7.11 shall control and be binding. With respect to the foregoing provisions, the following shall apply to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction would deem the laws of the State of Nevada
to be applicable to this Article. By executing this Agreement, each Guarantor (a) to the fullest extent permitted by law, waives and relinquishes any defense based on any right of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution or indemnification or
any other suretyship defenses it otherwise might or would have under Nevada law or other applicable law (including, to the extent permitted by Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 40.495, any defense or benefit that may be derived from
the one-action rule under NRS 40.430 and any other statute or judicial decisions to require Collateral Agent to proceed against or exhaust any security held by Collateral Agent or any Lender at any time or to pursue any other remedy in Collateral
Agents or any Lenders power before proceeding against any Guarantor) and agrees that it will be fully liable under this Article VII even though the Collateral Agent may foreclose on the Collateral or otherwise enforce any of its
rights and remedies under this Agreement, Security Documents or Mortgages, and even though Collateral Agent forecloses against the real property on which the Project is located or any portion thereof or the Collateral of any portion thereof;
(b) waives any and all defenses now or hereafter arising or asserted by reason of Guarantors rights under NRS 104.3605, Guarantor specifically agreeing that such waiver shall constitute a waiver of discharge under NRS 104.3605(9);
(c) waives the provisions of NRS 40.495(4) including, without limitation, the right to a fair market value hearing pursuant to NRS 40.495(4)(a) and the limitation on the money judgment set forth in NRS 40.495(4)(b); and (d) to the fullest
extent permitted by law, agrees that such Guarantor will not assert any such defense in any action or proceeding which the Collateral Agent may commence to enforce this Article VII. 
SECTION 7.12 Keepwell. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Loan Party to honor all of its obligations under this guarantee and any security interest granted under the Security Agreement in respect
of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 7.12 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this
Section 7.12, or otherwise under this guarantee, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this
Section 7.12 shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations have been paid and performed in full. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 7.12 constitute, and this Section 7.12 shall be
deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of each other Loan Party for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

material respect when so made, deemed made or furnished;  (d) default shall be made in the due observance or performance by any
Loan Party of any covenant, condition or agreement contained in Section 5.02(d), 5.03(a) or 5.08 or in Article VI;  (e) default shall be made in the due observance or performance by any Loan Party of any covenant, condition or agreement contained in any Loan Document (other than those specified in paragraphs (a),

Indebtedness (other than the Obligations), when and as the same shall become due and payable beyond any applicable grace period, or (ii) fail to observe or perform any other term, covenant, condition or agreement contained in any agreement or
instrument evidencing or governing any such Indebtedness if the effect of any failure referred to in this clause (ii) is to cause, or to permit the holder or holders of such Indebtedness or a trustee or other representative on its or their
behalf to cause, such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity or become subject to a mandatory purchase offer by the obligor; provided that it shall not constitute an Event of Default pursuant to this paragraph (f) unless
the aggregate amount of all such Indebtedness referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) exceeds $25,000,000 at any one time (provided that, in the case of Hedging Obligation

perfected security interest in and Lien on all of the Collateral thereunder with equal and ratable priority with the security interest and Liens created by the Term Loan Documents (subject to and after giving effect to the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement) (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in such Security Document and subject to Permitted Liens)) in favor of the Collateral Agent, or shall be asserted by Borrower or any other Loan Party not to be a valid, perfected (except
as otherwise provided in any Loan Document) security interest in or Lien on the Collateral covered thereby with equal and ratable priority with the security interest and Liens created by the Term Loan Documents (subject to and after giving effect to
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement); provided that no Event of Default shall occur under this clause (k) if the Loan Parties cooperate with the Secured Parties to replace or perfect such security interest and Lien, such security
interest and Lien is replaced and the rights, powers and privileges of the Secured Parties are not materially adversely affected by such replacement;  (l) any Loan Document or any material provisions thereof shall at any time and for any reason be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be null and void, or a proceeding shall be commenced by
any Loan Party, seeking to establish the invalidity or unenforceability thereof (exclusive of questions of interpretation of any provision thereof), or any Loan Party shall repudiate or deny any portion of its liability or obligation for the
Obligations;

an Party or any of its operators, managers or agents cease to conduct gaming activities or
operate any portion of the casino at any Gaming Facility for any reason whatsoever (other than temporary cessation in connection with alterations permitted hereunder or restoration following a Casualty Event) which cessation continues for five or
more Business Days and accounts for 10% or more of the consolidated gross revenues (calculated in accordance with GAAP) of the Loan Parties related to gaming operations; and  (o) any Permit or any material provision thereof shall be suspended, revoked, cancelled, terminated or materially and adversely modified or failed to be renewed or to be in full force and effect, if any
such failure, violation, breach, suspension, revocation, cancellation, termination, modification or non-renewal, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; 
then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to Borrower described in paragraph (g) or (h) above), and at any time thereafter
during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent, at the written request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to Borrower, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate forthwith
the Revolving Commitments and (ii) declare the Loans and reimbursement obligations in respect of any LC Disbursement then outstanding to be forthwith due and payable in whole or in part, whereupon the principal of the Loans and reimbursement
obligations in respect of any LC Disbursement so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other Obligations of Borrower accrued hereunder and under any other Loan Document, shall
become forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrower and the Guarantors, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary
notwithstanding; and in any event, with respect to Borrower described in paragraph (g) or (h) above, the Revolving Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans and reimbursement obligations in respect of any LC
Disbursement then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other Obligations of Borrower accrued hereunder and under any other Loan Document, shall automatically become due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrower and the Guarantors, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding. In addition, following
the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default hereunder, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall take all such actions under the Loan Documents and/or with respect to the Collateral as the Required Lenders may
direct.  SECTION 8.02 Rescission. If at any time after termination of the Revolving Commitments or acceleration
of the maturity of the Loans, Borrower shall pay all arrears of interest and all payments on account of principal of the Loans owing by it that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on principal and, to the extent
permitted by law, on overdue interest, at the rates specified herein) and all Defaults (other than non-payment of principal of and accrued interest on the Loans due and payable solely by virtue of acceleration) shall be remedied or waived pursuant
to Sec- 
  -109-




tion 10.02, then upon the written consent of the Required Lenders and written notice to Borrower, the termination of the Revolving Commitments or the acceleration and their
consequences may be rescinded and annulled; but such action shall not affect any subsequent Default or impair any right or remedy consequent thereon. The provisions of the preceding sentence are intended merely to bind the Lenders to a decision that
may be made at the election of the Required Lenders, and such provisions are not intended to benefit Borrower and do not give Borrower the right to require the Lenders to rescind or annul any acceleration hereunder, even if the conditions set forth
herein are met.  SECTION 8.03 Application of Proceeds. Subject to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, the proceeds received by the Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral pursuant to the exercise by the Collateral Agent of its remedies shall be applied, in
full or in part, together with any other sums then held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement, promptly by the Collateral Agent as follows:  (a) First, to the payment of all reasonable costs and expenses, fees, commissions and taxes of such sale, collection or other realization including compensation to the Administrative Agent,
Collateral Agent and their agents and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent in connection therewith and all amounts for which the Administrative Agent and Collateral
Agent is entitled to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of any Loan Document, together with interest on each such amount at the highest rate then in effect under this Agreement from and after the date such amount is due, owing or unpaid
until paid in full;  (b) Second, to the payment of all other reasonable costs and expenses of such sale, collection or
other realization including all costs, liabilities and advances made or incurred by the other Secured Parties in connection therewith, together with interest on each such amount at the highest rate then in effect under this Agreement from and after
the date such amount is due, owing or unpaid until paid in full;  (c) Third, without duplication of amounts applied
pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) above, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash, pro rata, of interest and other amounts constituting Obligations (other than principal, reimbursement obligations in respect of LC Disbursements and
obligations to Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit) and any fees, premiums and scheduled periodic payments due under Hedging Agreements or Treasury Services Agreements constituting Secured Obligations and any interest accrued thereon, in each case
equally and ratably in accordance with the respective amounts thereof then due and owing;  (d) Fourth, to the
indefeasible payment in full in cash, pro rata, of principal amount of the Obligations (including reimbursement obligations in respect of LC Disbursements and obligations to Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit) and any premium thereon and any
breakage, termination or other payments under Hedging Agreements and Treasury Services Agreements constituting Secured Obligations and any interest accrued thereon; and  (e) Fifth, the balance, if any, to the person lawfully entitled thereto (including the applicable Loan Party or its successors or assigns) or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.
 In the event that any such proceeds are insufficient to pay in full the items described in clauses (a) through (e) of this
Section 8.03, the Loan Parties shall remain liable, jointly and severally, for any deficiency.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
amounts received from the Borrower or any Guarantor that is not a Qualified ECP Guarantor shall not be applied to the Obligations that are Excluded Swap Obligations.

SECTION 8.04 Borrowers Right to Cure. 
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 8.01, in the event Borrower fails to comply with any
Financial Performance Covenant with respect to a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, then Borrower may elect to include the net cash proceeds of any Equity Contribution made prior to the expiration of the tenth day after the date on which
financial statements are required to be delivered with respect to the last fiscal quarter of such four fiscal quarter period in Consolidated EBITDA with respect to such applicable quarter (which Equity Contribution shall increase Consolidated EBITDA
by the amount of such net cash proceeds); provided that such net cash proceeds (i) are actually received by Borrower (including through a capital contribution of such net cash proceeds) no later than 15 days after the date on which
financial statements are required to be delivered with respect to such fiscal quarter hereunder and (ii) do not exceed the aggregate amount necessary for purposes of complying (by addition to Consolidated EBITDA) with such Financial Performance
Covenant for such period. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, this Section 8.04(a) (and any Equity Contribution or the proceeds thereof) may not be
relied on for purposes of calculating any financial ratios (other than as applicable to the Financial Performance Covenants for purposes of increasing Consolidated EBITDA as provided herein) or any available basket or thresholds under this
Agreement.  (b) The parties hereto agree that (i) in each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, there shall be at
least two fiscal quarters in which no Equity Contribution is made, (ii) during the term of this Agreement, no more than four Equity Contributions related to this Section 8.04 will be made and (iii) if a Notice of Intent to Cure
has been delivered, no remedies with respect to a Default or Event of Default relating to the Financial Performance Covenant that is to be cured may be exercised, unless such cure does not occur by the period required above. 
ARTICLE IX 
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT  SECTION 9.01 Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent and
the Collateral Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes such Agents to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to such Agents by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions
and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article (other than Section 9.06 and Section 9.10 which benefit, and may be enforced by, the Loan Parties) are solely for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank, and the Lenders, and neither Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. 
SECTION 9.02 Rights as a Lender. Each person serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its
capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include
each person serving as an Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own equity interests in, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally
engage in any kind of business with Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such person were not an Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 
  -111-



SECTION 9.03 Exculpatory Provisions. No Agent shall have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Agent:  (i) shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; 
(ii) shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary
rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that such Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided
for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that such Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its judgment or the judgment of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or
applicable Requirements of Law; and  (iii) shall, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the person serving as such Agent or any of its Affiliates
in any capacity.  No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (x) with the consent or at the request
of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or (y) in the
absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to such Agent by Borrower, a Lender or the Issuing Bank. 
No Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance
of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term agent in this Agreement with reference to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising
under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term us used merely as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. 
Each party to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent will use an outside service provider for the tracking
of all UCC financing statements required to be filed pursuant to the Loan Documents and notification to the Administrative Agent, of, among other things, the upcoming lapse or expiration thereof, and that such service provider will be deemed to be
acting at the request and on behalf of Borrower and the other Loan Parties. No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by such service provider.  SECTION 9.04 Reliance by Agent. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement,
instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or 
  -112-




other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper person. Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that
by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the Issuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it,
and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  SECTION 9.05 Delegation of Duties. Each Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through, or delegate
any and all such rights and powers to, any one or more sub agents appointed by such Agent. Each Agent and any such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The
exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities
provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.  SECTION 9.06 Resignation/Removal of Agent. 
(a) Each Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and Borrower. Upon receipt of any such
notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a
bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after
the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above, provided that if the Agent shall notify Borrower and the Lenders
that no qualifying person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Collateral Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security as
nominee until such time as a successor Collateral Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments and communications provided to be made by, to or through an Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the Issuing Bank directly (and any
determinations to be made by the Collateral Agent shall instead by made by the Required Lenders), until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of a successors
appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and
obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless
otherwise agreed between Borrower and such successor. The predecessor Agent shall pay to the successor the pro rata portion of any annual administration fee paid in advance by Borrower for the portion of the year between the time of the successor
Agents acceptance of its appointment as the Agent and the following anniversary date of this Agreement. After the retiring Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article IX and
Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting
as Agent. 
  -113-



(b) Any resignation by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 9.06(a) shall, unless JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. gives notice to Borrower otherwise, also constitute its resignation as Issuing Bank and as Swingline Lender, and such resignation as Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender shall become
effective simultaneously with the discharge of the Administrative Agent from its duties and obligations as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph (except as to already outstanding Letters of Credit and LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans,
as to which the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender shall continue in such capacities until the LC Exposure relating thereto shall be reduced to zero and such Swingline Loans shall have been repaid, as applicable, or until the successor
Administrative Agent shall succeed to the roles of Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender in accordance with the next sentence and perform the actions required by the next sentence). Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative
Agent hereunder, unless JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and such successor give notice to Borrower otherwise, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank and
Swingline Lender and (ii) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring Issuing
Bank to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit. At the time any such resignation of the Issuing Bank shall become effective, Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account
of the retiring Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.06(d).  SECTION 9.07 Non-Reliance on Agent and Other
Lenders. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis
and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender further represents and warrants that it has reviewed each document made available to it on the Platform in connection with this Agreement and has acknowledged and accepted the terms and
conditions applicable to the recipients thereof. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent, the Issuing Bank or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as
it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 SECTION 9.08 Withholding Tax. To the extent required by any applicable law (as determined by the Administrative
Agent), the Administrative Agent may deduct or withhold from any payment to any Lender under any Loan Document an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other authority of the United States or
other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or not property executed,
or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent (to
the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Loan Parties pursuant to Sections 2.12 and 2.15 and without limiting any obligation of the Loan Parties to do so pursuant to such Sections) fully for
all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Taxes or otherwise, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses and any other out-of-pocket expenses, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally imposed
or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document 
  -114-




against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.08. The agreements in this Section 9.08 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the
Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Revolving Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, the term
Lender shall, for purposes of this Section 9.08, include any Issuing Bank and any Swingline Lender. 
SECTION 9.09 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Sole Bookrunner, Arranger
or Documentation Agent listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, the Issuing Bank or a Lender hereunder.  SECTION 9.10 Collateral Matters. The Lenders and the Agents
irrevocably agree that any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent and the Guarantees provided by the Loan Parties under any Loan Document shall be automatically terminated and released
(i) upon payment in full of all Secured Obligations (other than (x) Hedging Obligations not yet due and payable, (y) obligations under Treasury Services Agreements not yet due and payable and (z) contingent indemnification
obligations not yet accrued and payable), (ii) at the time the property subject to such Lien is transferred or to be transferred as part of or in connection with any transfer permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document (and the
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate to that effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its reasonable request without further inquiry) to any person other than a Loan Party, (iii) subject to
Section 10.02, if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, or (iv) if the property subject to such Lien is owned by a Guarantor, upon release of such Guarantor from its
obligations under its Guarantee pursuant to Section 7.09.  The Agents shall, upon the request of Borrower, and is
hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to:  (i) release or subordinate any Lien on any property granted
to or held by the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 6.02(q), to the extent required by the terms of the obligations secured by such Liens; 
(ii) consent to and enter into (and execute documents permitting the filing and recording, where appropriate) (x) the
grant of easements and covenants, conditions, restrictions and declarations and (y) subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreements, in each case in favor of the ultimate purchasers, or tenants under leases or subleases of any portion
of the Project, as applicable, in connection with the transactions contemplated by Sections 6.06(f), (l), (m) and (n); and  (iii) subordinate any Mortgage to any reciprocal easement agreements, covenants, conditions and restrictions and other similar rights reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent which are requested
by the Loan Parties pursuant to the transactions contemplated by Sections 6.06(l), (m) and (n).  In
each case as specified in this Section 9.10, the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at Borrowers expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents
as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the security interest granted under the Security Documents or any such consents or subordination agreements or intercreditor agreements to effectuate
the matters referenced above, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, Section 7.09 and this Section 9.10. 
  -115-



SECTION 9.11 Enforcement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in
connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent, or as the Required Lenders may require or otherwise direct, for the benefit of all the Lenders and the Issuing Bank; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents, (b) the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be) hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents, (c) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of this Agreement, or (d) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the
pendency of a proceeding relative to any Loan Party under any bankruptcy or insolvency law.  SECTION 9.12 First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement and Collateral Matters. The Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby agree to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and acknowledge that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (and any successor Collateral Agent under the
Security Documents) will be serving as Collateral Agent for the Secured Parties pursuant to the Security Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank hereby consents to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and any
successor serving in such capacity and agrees not to assert any claim (including as a result of any conflict of interest) against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., or any such successor, arising from the role of the Collateral Agent under the Security
Documents or the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement so long as the Collateral Agent is either acting in accordance with the express terms of such documents or otherwise has not engaged in gross negligence or willful misconduct.

statements, financial and other reports, certificates and other information materials, but excluding any such communication that (i) relates to a request for a new, or a conversion of an existing, Borrowing or other extension of credit
(including any election of an interest rate or interest period relating thereto), (ii) relates to the payment of any principal or other amount due under this Agreement prior to the scheduled date therefor, (iii) provides notice of any
Default under this Agreement or (iv) is required to be delivered to satisfy any condition precedent to the effectiveness of this Agreement and/or any borrowing or other extension of credit hereunder (all such non-excluded communications,
collectively, the Communications), by transmitting the Communications in an electronic/soft medium in a format reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent at covenant.compliance@jpmchase.com and
mohammad.s.hasan@jpmorgan.com or at such other e-mail address(es) provided to Borrower from time to time or in such other form, including hard copy delivery thereof, as the Administrative Agent shall require. In addition, each Loan Party
agrees to continue to provide the Communications to the Administrative Agent in the manner specified in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in such other form, including hard copy delivery thereof, as the Administrative Agent shall require.
Nothing in this Section 10.01 shall prejudice the right of the Agents, any Lender or any Loan Party to give any notice or other communication pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any other manner specified in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or as any such Agent shall require. 
  -118-



To the extent consented to by the Administrative Agent in writing from time to time,
Administrative Agent agrees that receipt of the Communications by the Administrative Agent at its e-mail address(es) set forth above shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to the Administrative Agent for purposes of the Loan
Documents.  Each Loan Party further agrees that Administrative Agent may make the Communications available to the Lenders by
posting the Communications on IntraLinks or a substantially similar electronic transmission system (the Platform). The Platform is provided as is and as available. The Agents do not warrant the accuracy or
completeness of the Communications, or the adequacy of the Platform and expressly disclaim liability for errors or omissions in the communications. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, any warranty
of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by any Agent in connection with the Communications or the Platform. In no event shall the
Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties have any liability to the Loan Parties, any Lender or any other person for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, losses or expenses
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of any Loan Partys or the Administrative Agents transmission of communications through the Internet, except to the extent the liability of such person is found in a final
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such persons bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct or breach of this Agreement. 
(e) Public/Private. Each Loan Party hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to distribute (i) to Private Siders all
Communications, including any Communication that Borrower identifies in writing is to be distributed to Private Siders only (Private Side Communications), and (ii) to Public Siders all Communications other than any Private
Side Communication. Borrower represents and warrants that no Communication (other than Private Side Communications) contains any MNPI. Borrower agrees to designate as Private Side Communications only those Communications or portions thereof that it
reasonably believes in good faith constitute MNPI and agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts not to designate any Communications provided under Section 5.01(a), (b), (c) and (d) as Private Side Communications.
Private Siders shall mean Lenders employees and representatives who have declared that they are authorized to receive MNPI. Public Siders shall mean Lenders employees and representatives who have not
declared that they are authorized to receive MNPI; it being understood that Public Siders may be engaged in investment and other market-related activities with respect to Borrowers or its affiliates securities or loans.
MNPI shall mean Projections and other material non-public information (within the meaning of United States federal securities laws) with respect to Borrower, its subsidiaries and any of their respective securities. 
Each Lender acknowledges that United States federal and state securities laws prohibit any person from purchasing or selling securities on
the basis of material, non-public information concerning the issuer of such securities or, subject to certain limited exceptions, from communicating such information to any other person. Each Lender confirms that it has developed procedures designed
to ensure compliance with these securities laws.  Each Lender acknowledges that circumstances may arise that require it to
refer to Private Side Communications that may contain MNPI. Accordingly, each Lender agrees that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to designate at least one individual to receive Private Side Communications on its behalf in compliance with
its procedures and applicable law and identify such designee (including such designees contact information) on such Lenders Administrative Questionnaire. Each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent in writing from time to time
of such Lenders designees e-mail address to which notice of the availability of Private Side Communications may be sent by electronic transmission. 
  -119-



Each Lender that elects not to be given access to Private Side Communications does so
voluntarily and, by such election, (i) acknowledges and agrees that the Agents and other Lenders may have access to Private Side Communications that such electing Lender does not have and (ii) takes sole responsibility for the consequences
of, and waives any and all claims based on or arising out of, not having access to Private Side Communications.  SECTION
10.02 Waivers; Amendment.  (a) Generally. No failure or delay by any Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in
exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or
power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of each Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights
or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by this Section 10.02,
and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed
as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether any Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on Borrower in any case shall entitle Borrower to any other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.  (b) Required Consents. Subject to Section 10.02(c) and
(e), neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into
by Borrower and the Administrative Agent or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent (in the case of any Security Document, the Existing
Intercreditor Agreements or the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are party thereto, in each case with the written consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall be effective
if the effect thereof would:  (i) increase the Revolving Commitment of any Lender without the written consent
of such Lender (it being understood that no amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent with respect to any condition precedent, covenant or Default shall constitute an increase in the Revolving Commitment of any Lender); 
(ii) reduce the principal amount or premium, if any, of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon
(other than interest pursuant to Section 2.07(c)) or reduce any Fees payable hereunder, or change the form or currency of payment of any Obligation, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby (it being
understood that (A) any amendment or modification to the financial definitions in this Agreement shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest for purposes of this clause (ii) and (B) no consent of any other person other
than such Lender directly affected thereby shall be required in connection with such actions); 
  -120-



(iii)(A) change the scheduled final maturity of any Loan, (B) postpone
the date for payment of any LC Reimbursement Obligation or any interest, premium or fees payable hereunder, (C) change the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment (other than waiver of any increase in the interest rate pursuant to
Section 2.07(c)), or (D) postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Revolving Commitment beyond the Revolving Commitment Termination Date, in any case, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby (and
no consent of any other person shall be required);  (iv) increase the maximum duration of Interest Periods
hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;  (v) permit the assignment or
delegation by Borrower of any of its rights or obligations under any Loan Document, without the written consent of each Lender (provided that a merger or consolidation that is otherwise permitted by the Loan Documents (regardless of which person is
the survivor thereof) shall not be considered an assignment or delegation);  (vi) release all or substantially
all of the Guarantors from their Guarantee (except as expressly provided in Article VII), or limit liability of all or substantially all the Guarantors in respect of their Guarantee, without the written consent of each Lender;
 (vii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents or alter the
relative priorities of the Secured Obligations entitled to the Liens of the Security Documents, in each case without the written consent of each Lender (it being understood that Indebtedness consented to by the Required Lenders may be equally and
ratably secured by the Collateral with the then existing Secured Obligations under the Security Documents); 
(viii) change Section 2.14(b), (c) or (d) in a manner that would alter the pro rata
sharing of payments or setoffs required thereby or any other provision in a manner that would alter the pro rata allocation among the Lenders of Loan disbursements, including the requirements of Section 2.02(a), without the written
consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;  (ix) change any provision of this
Section 10.02(b) or (c), without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby (except for additional restrictions on amendments or waivers for Indebtedness consented to by the Required Lenders); 
(x) change the percentage set forth in the definition of Required Lenders or any other provision of any Loan
Document (including this Section) specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, other
than to increase such percentage or number or to give any additional Lender or group of Lenders such right to waive, amend or modify or make any such determination or grant any such consent; 
(xi) change or waive any obligation of the Lenders relating to the issuance of or purchase of participations in Letters of
Credit, without the written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank;  (xii) change or waive
any provision hereof relating to Swingline Loans (including the definition of Swingline Revolving Commitment), without the written consent of the Swingline Lender; or 
  -121-



(xiii) change or waive any provision of Article IX as the same
applies to any Agent, or any other provision hereof as the same applies to the rights or obligations of any Agent, in each case without the written consent of such Agent.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i)(A) any Loan Document may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by Borrower and
the Administrative Agent (without the consent of any Lender) solely to cure a defect or error, or to grant a new Lien for the benefit of the Secured Parties or extend an existing Lien over additional property or to make modifications which are not
materially adverse to the Lenders and are required by Gaming Authorities and (B) such amendment shall become effective without any further consent of any other party to such Loan Document, (ii) additional extensions of credit consented to
by Required Lenders shall be permitted hereunder on a ratable basis with the existing Loans (including as to proceeds of, and sharing in the benefits of, Collateral and sharing of prepayments) and (iii) no Defaulting Lender shall have any right
to approve or disapprove of any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder, except to the extent the consent of such Lender would be required under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the proviso of the first sentence of this
Section 10.02(b).  (c) Collateral. Without the consent of any other person, the applicable Loan Party or
Parties and the Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent may (in its or their respective sole discretion, or shall, to the extent required by any Loan Document) enter into any amendment or waiver of any Loan Document, or enter into any new
agreement or instrument (including consents to assignments with third parties), to effect the granting, perfection, protection, expansion or enhancement of any security interest in any Collateral or additional property to become Collateral for the
benefit of the Secured Parties (including consents to assignments), or as required by local law to give effect to, or protect any security interest for the benefit of the Secured Parties, in any property or so that the security interests therein
comply with applicable Requirements of Law or to terminate any Control Agreements which are not required under the Security Documents and to enter into Control Agreements with respect to accounts created after the Closing Date, to the extent
required under the Loan Documents.  (d) Dissenting Lenders. If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver,
discharge or termination of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by Section 10.02(b), the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained but the consent of one or more of such other Lenders whose consent is required is not
obtained, then Borrower shall have the right to replace all, but not less than all, of such non-consenting Lender or Lenders (so long as all non-consenting Lenders are so replaced) with one or more persons pursuant to Section 2.16(b) so
long as at the time of such replacement each such new Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination. 
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.02 to the contrary, (i) in connection with the incurrence by any Loan
Party or any Subsidiary thereof of additional Indebtedness, including pursuant to Section 6.01(d), each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent agree to execute and deliver any amendments, amendments and restatements,
re-statements or waivers of or supplements to or other modifications to, any Security Document, and to make or consent to any filings or take any other actions in connection therewith, including the entry into the intercreditor agreement referred to
in Section 6.01(d), as may be reasonably deemed by Borrower to be necessary or reasonably desirable for any Lien on the assets of any Loan Party permitted to secure such additional Indebtedness to become a valid, perfected lien (with
such priority as may be designated by the relevant Loan Party or Subsidiary, to the extent such priority is permitted by the Loan Documents) pursuant to the Security Document being so amended, amended and restated, restated, waived, supplemented or
otherwise modified or otherwise and (ii) the Agents are authorized by the Lenders to enter into the agreements and instruments permitted under Section 6.06 and Section 9.10.

relevant jurisdiction for any Indemnitee) incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any party hereto or any third party arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any amendment, amendment and restatement, modification or waiver of the provisions hereof or thereof, or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of
their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the

indefeasibly pay any amount required under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 10.03 to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the Collateral Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the Issuing Bank,
the Swingline Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Collateral Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender, or
such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount (such indemnity shall be effective whether or not the
related losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses are incurred or asserted by any party hereto or any third party); provided (i) that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related
expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Collateral Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such, or against any
Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or the Collateral Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) in connection with such capacity or (ii) such indemnity for the Swingline Lender or the Issuing
Bank shall not include losses incurred by the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank due to one or more Lenders defaulting in their obligations to purchase participations of Swingline Exposure under Section 2.17(c) or LC Exposure under
Section 2.18(d) or to make Revolving Loans under Section 2.18(e) (it being understood that this proviso shall not affect the Swingline Lenders or the Issuing Banks rights against any Defaulting Lender). The
obligations of the Lenders under this paragraph (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.14. For purposes hereof, a Lenders pro rata share shall be determined based upon its share of the sum of the
outstanding Loans and unused Revolving Commitments at the time.  (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, no Loan Party shall assert, and each Loan Party hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as
opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or

 (e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than 3 Business Days after demand therefor.

provided in paragraph (d) of this Section 10.04 and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the other Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
(b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of the assigning Lender or an
Approved Fund, any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:  (i) except in the case of any
assignment made in connection with the primary syndication of the Revolving Commitment and Loans by the Arranger to persons identified by the Administrative Agent to Borrower on or prior to the Closing Date and made within 30 days of the Closing

purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Revolving Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the
Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $1,000,000; 
(ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders
rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Revolving Commitment assigned; and

the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (except that simultaneous assignments by or to two or more Funds under common management shall require the payment of only a single
processing and recordation fee), and the Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as
a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section 10.04.

non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York, New York a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Revolving
Commitments of, and principal amounts (and related interest amounts) of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive absent manifest error, and Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower, the Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender, the Collateral Agent and any Lender (with respect to its own interest only), at any reasonable
time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  (e) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the

Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole
right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, Borrower
agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.15 (subject to the requirements and limitations of those Sections and Section 2.16, and it being understood that the
documentation required under Section 2.15(e) shall be delivered solely to the participating Lender) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.
Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at Borrowers request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.16(b) with respect to any Participant. To the extent
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.14 as though it were a Lender. In
addition, each Lender selling a participation to one or more Participants under this Section 10.04(e) shall, acting as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, keep a register, specifying the name and address of each Participant and each such
Participants entitlement to payments of principal (and related interest amounts) with respect to such participation (the Participant Register). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest
error, and Borrower and the Lenders shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary; provided that no
Lender shall have the obligation to disclose all or a portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of the Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Loans or other obligations under any Loan
Document) to any person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary in connection with a Tax audit or other Tax proceeding to establish that any loans are in registered form for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
(f) Limitations on Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.15 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent that the Participants right to a greater
payment results from a Change in Law after the Participant became a Participant. 
  -126-



(g) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. In the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans, such Lender may, without the consent of Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, collaterally assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement, including the Loans and Notes or any other instrument evidencing its rights as a Lender under this Agreement, to any holder of, trustee for,
or any other representative of holders of, obligations owed or securities issued, by such fund, as security for such obligations or securities.  (h) Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to
include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case
may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Requirement of Law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state
laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.  SECTION 10.05 Survival of Agreement. All covenants,
agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have
been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its
behalf and notwithstanding that the Agents, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Revolving Commitments have not
expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.12, 2.15, 9.10, 10.09, 10.10, and 10.12 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the payment of the LC Reimbursement Obligations, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Revolving Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
 SECTION 10.06 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by
different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements
with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the
subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that,
when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopier or other electronic transmission (i.e., a pdf or tif
document) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 
  -127-



SECTION 10.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.  SECTION 10.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and the Issuing Bank is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at
any time owing by such Lender or the Issuing Bank to or for the credit or the account of Borrower or any other Loan Party against any and all of the obligations of Borrower or such Loan Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document to such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of Borrower or such Loan Party may be
contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or the Issuing Bank different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender and the Issuing Bank under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or Issuing Bank may have. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank agrees to notify Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff
and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 
SECTION 10.09 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. 
(a) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York, without
regard to conflicts of law principles that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.  (b)

the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such
Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any Loan
Party or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.  (c) Waiver of Venue. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document in any court referred to in Section 10.09(b). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

Agreement, any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether based on contract, tort or any other theory). Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other

applicable Requirements of Law (collectively, the Charges), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such
Loan in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the

waiver of any right, remedy, power or privilege under or in respect hereof or any Loan Document; or

discharge of, the Loan Parties.  SECTION 10.16 Waiver of Immunity. To the extent that Borrower or any of the
other Loan Parties has, or hereafter may be entitled to claim or may acquire, for themselves, any Collateral or other assets of the Loan Parties, any immunity (whether sovereign or otherwise) from suit, jurisdiction of any court or from any legal
process (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution or otherwise) with respect to themselves, any Collateral or any other assets of the Loan Parties, Borrower and the other Loan Parties hereby

Borrower and the Substitute Lender shall pay to the Disqualified Lender all amounts that would have been required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.16 had such Disqualified Lender been replaced in accordance with such provisions.
 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 10.18, if any Lender becomes a
Disqualified Lender, and if the Administrative Agent fails to find a Substitute Lender pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 10.18 within any time period specified by the appropriate Gaming Authority for the withdrawal of a
Disqualified Lender (the Withdrawal Period), such Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to the outstanding Loans of such Lender in favor of one or more Eligible Assignees that is not an

Loans of such Lender, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, fees and costs payable under this Agreement through the date of the Assignment and Assumption. Alternatively, Borrower may immediately prepay in full the outstanding amount of all Loans of
such Disqualified Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the earlier of (x) the date of payment or (y) the last day of the applicable Withdrawal Period, and any other amounts that would have been required to be paid to such
Disqualified Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 had such Disqualified Lender been replaced in accordance with such provision, and all unfunded commitments of such Disqualified Lender shall expire and terminate upon such prepayment. This
clause (b) shall supersede any provisions of Section 2.14 or 10.02. 
  -131-



(c) Upon the prepayment of all amounts owing to any Lender in accordance with this
Section 10.18, such Disqualified Lender shall no longer constitute a Lender for purposes hereof; provided, any rights of such Lender to indemnification hereunder shall survive as to such Lender. 
(d) The interests, with respect to this Agreement, of any Disqualified Lender shall be subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of all
Gaming Authorities.  SECTION 10.19 Gaming Authorities and Liquor Laws. Each party to this Agreement hereby
