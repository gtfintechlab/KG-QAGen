Equityholder and Collateral Agent) a notice by electronic mail either in the form of Exhibit A hereto or containing the information set forth in Exhibit A hereto (together with any attachments or responses required

  -66- 





in connection therewith, an Approval Request). Such approval may take the form of a standing list of pre-approved assets containing the
characteristics of each pre-approved asset (other than purchase price), together with a notice of intention to trade containing the par amount and purchase price of the Collateral Loan(s) being acquired
delivered on or prior to 11:00 a.m. on the proposed trade date.  (b) The Administrative Agent shall have the right to approve or reject any
Approval Request in its sole discretion and/or to request additional information regarding any proposed Collateral Loan. The Administrative Agent shall promptly after receipt by the Administrative Agent of all required information and documentation
notify the Collateral Manager and the Borrower (with a copy to the Collateral Agent and the Collateral Administrator) in writing (including via electronic mail) whether each Approval Request has been approved or rejected; provided that if the
Administrative Agent shall fail to so notify the Collateral Manager and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have rejected such Approval Request. Any approval may be withdrawn at any time at least three (3) Business Days

the Administrative Agent to the Collateral Manager. If the Borrower has not entered into a binding obligation to purchase such Collateral Loan within thirty (30) Business Days of the date of such approval or a material and adverse change occurs
with respect to such Collateral Loan or the related Obligor, then, except as provided in the next succeeding sentence, the Borrower shall re-submit an Approval Request and shall not be authorized to purchase
such proposed Collateral Loan until the Administrative Agent approves such updated Approval Request in its sole discretion. If the Administrative Agent has rejected an Approval Request, or withdrawn or withheld its approval of any such request, then
the Borrower shall not be authorized to purchase such proposed Collateral Loan unless, in the case of a withdrawn approval (including any withdrawal or requirement to re-submit an Approval Request pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence), the Administrative Agent has not withdrawn its approval at least three (3) Business Days prior to the time at which the Borrower enters into a commitment to purchase such proposed Collateral Loan. 
(c) On the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, including Article III, each Lender severally
agrees to make loans to the Borrower (x) to finance the purchase or origination of Middle Market Loans (each, an Advance (MM)) and (y) to finance the purchase or origination of other Eligible Collateral Loans (each, an

Advances (MM), such Lenders Commitment (MM), (y) in the case of Advances (Other), such Lenders Commitment (Other), and (z) in the aggregate such Lenders Commitment and, as to all Lenders, in an aggregate principal amount up to
but not exceeding the Borrowing Base (Aggregate) as then in effect. Each such borrowing of an Advance on any single day is referred to herein as a Borrowing. 
Within such limits and subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower may borrow (and re-borrow) Advances under this Section 2.01 and prepay Advances under Section 2.05.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if, upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default and on the Commitment Termination Date, the amount on deposit in the Unfunded Reserve Account is less than the Unfunded Exposure Amount (such amount, the Unfunded Reserve Account Shortfall), the Borrower shall cause to be
deposited in the Unfunded Reserve Account an amount equal to the Unfunded Reserve Account Shortfall. Following receipt of a Notice of Borrowing relating to the foregoing (which shall specify the account details of the Unfunded Reserve Account where
the funds will be made available), each Lender shall fund its pro rata portion of such Advances in accordance with Section 2.02(e), notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (including, without limitation, the
Borrowers failure to satisfy any of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.02); provided that no such Advance may cause the Advances Outstanding to exceed the Borrowing Base (Aggregate). 
Section 2.02 Making of the Advances

(b) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, dated the date the request for
the related Borrowing is being made, signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Borrower), shall attach a Borrowing Base Calculation Statement, and shall otherwise be appropriately completed. Such
Notice of Borrowing shall specify the proposed Borrowing Date, whether such Advance is an Advance (MM) or an Advance (Other), and the Eligible Currency. The proposed Borrowing Date specified in each Notice of Borrowing shall be a Business Day
falling on or prior to the Commitment Termination Date and, with respect to Borrowings in Dollars, the amount of the Borrowing requested in such Notice of Borrowing (the Requested Amount) shall be equal to at least $1,000,000 or
an integral multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the remaining unfunded Commitments hereunder or, in the case of Delayed Drawdown Collateral Loans or Revolving Collateral Loans, such lesser amount required to be funded by the
Borrower in respect thereof); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a Borrowing in any Eligible Currency (other than Dollars), there is no required minimum amount or integral multiple. 
(c) The Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of its receipt of such Notice of Borrowing by 5:00 p.m. on the day of receipt thereof
(or, if such day is not a Business Day, by noon on the next succeeding Business Day).  (d) Each Lender shall, not later than 11:00 a.m. on
each Borrowing Date in respect of Advances, make its Percentage of the applicable Requested Amount available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds by disbursing such funds to the account of the Administrative Agent in accordance
with the wiring instruction set forth in the notification of Notice of Borrowing delivered by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.02(a). Once each Lender has funded its Percentage of the applicable
Requested Amount, the Administrative Agent shall make the Requested Amount available to the Borrower by disbursing such funds to the Collection Account. 
  -68- 




(e) On each Monthly Reporting Date, the Advances Outstanding shall be re-balanced so that (x) the ratio of Advances (MM) to Advances Outstanding equals (y) the ratio of the Aggregate Asset Value of all Eligible Collateral Loans constituting Middle Market Loans to the
Aggregate Asset Value of all Eligible Collateral Loans.  Section 2.03 Evidence of Indebtedness; Notes 
(a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to it
and resulting from the Advances made by such Lender to the Borrower, from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest thereon and paid to it, from time to time hereunder; provided that the failure of any Lender to maintain
such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Advances in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon the information
provided to it by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Advances Outstanding with respect to each Lender.  (b) Any Lender may
request that its Advances to the Borrower be evidenced by a Note. In such event, the Borrower shall promptly prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to such Lender and otherwise appropriately completed. Thereafter, the Advances of
such Lender evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.06(a)) be represented by a Note payable to such Lender (or registered assigns pursuant to
Section 12.06(a)), except to the extent that such Lender (or assignee) subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Advances once again be evidenced as described in
clause (a) of this Section 2.03.  (c) If any Lender elects not to receive a Note, all
references herein and the other Facility Documents to such Lenders Note shall be deemed to mean the Advances Outstanding with respect to such Lender. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions herein and the other Facility
Documents related to the Lenders hereunder shall apply to each Lender regardless of whether such Lender has received a Note. 
Section 2.04 Payment of Amounts 
The Borrower shall pay principal and Interest on the Advances and the fees set forth in the Facility Documents to the Lenders in accordance
with the Priority of Payments as follows:  (a) 100% of the outstanding principal amount of each Advance, together with all accrued and
unpaid Interest thereon, shall be payable on the Final Maturity Date.  (b) Interest shall accrue at the Interest Rate on the unpaid
principal amount of each Advance from the date of such Advance until such principal amount is paid in full.  (c) The Administrative Agent
shall determine the unpaid Interest, Commitment Fees, and Prepayment Fees payable thereto prior to each Payment Date using the applicable Interest Rate for the related Interest Accrual Period to be paid by the Borrower with respect to each

  -69- 





Advance on each Payment Date for the related Interest Accrual Period and shall advise each Lender and the Collateral Manager thereof and shall send a consolidated invoice of all such Interest,
Commitment Fees, and Prepayment Fees to the Borrower (with a copy to the Collateral Administrator) at least two (2) Business Days prior to such Payment Date. The Collateral Administrator shall have no duty to verify or recalculate the amounts
provided by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.04 and is fully protected in relying on these amounts when preparing the Monthly Report. 
(d) Accrued Interest on each Advance shall be payable in arrears (i) on each Payment Date, and (ii) in connection with any prepayment
in full of the Advances pursuant to Section 2.05(a); provided that (x) with respect to any prepayment in full of the Advances Outstanding, accrued Interest on such amount through the date of prepayment may be
payable on such date or as otherwise agreed to between the Lenders and the Borrower and (y) with respect to any partial prepayment of the Advances outstanding, accrued Interest on such amount through the date of prepayment shall be payable on
the Payment Date following such prepayment. Accrued Commitment Fees shall be payable in arrears on each Payment Date.  (e) The obligation
of the Borrower to pay the Obligations, including the obligation of the Borrower to pay the Lenders the outstanding principal amount of the Advances and accrued interest thereon, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms hereof (including Section 2.15), under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower or any other Person may have or
have had against any Secured Party or any other Person.  (f) Unless otherwise specified by the Borrower, any reduction of Advances shall
reduce the Advances (MM) and the Advances (Other) pro rata based on the aggregate Advances Outstanding.  Section 2.05
Prepayment of Advances  (a) Optional Prepayments. The Borrower may, from time to time on any Business Day, voluntarily prepay
Advances in whole or in part, without penalty or premium; provided that the Borrower (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Borrower) shall have delivered to the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent written notice of such
prepayment (such notice, a Notice of Prepayment) in the form of Exhibit C hereto not later than 3:00 p.m. one (1) Business Day (or such shorter period as the Administrative Agent may agree in its
reasonable discretion) prior to the date of such prepayment (provided that same day notice may be given to cure any non-compliance with the Borrowing Base Test). The Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Lenders of such Notice of Prepayment. Each such Notice of Prepayment shall be irrevocable and effective upon receipt and shall be dated the date such notice is being given, signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower (or the
Collateral Manager on behalf of the Borrower) and otherwise appropriately completed; provided that any such Notice of Prepayment may be conditioned upon the happening or occurrence of a specified event, and thereafter revoked in the event
that such specified event does not occur. Each prepayment by the Borrower of any Advance denominated in Dollars pursuant to this Section 2.05(a) (other than a prepayment made in order to cure any non-compliance with the Borrowing Base Test) shall in each case be in a principal amount of at least $100,000 or, if less, the entire outstanding principal amount of the

  -70- 





Advances Outstanding or, in the case of any prepayment of Advances with the proceeds of a prepayment or repayment of principal of Collateral Loans, such lesser amount as is paid by the applicable
Obligor in respect thereof. Each prepayment by the Borrower of Advance denominated in an Eligible Currency shall be made with such Eligible Currency. If a Notice of Prepayment is given by (or on behalf of) the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such
prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein unless such notice is rescinded in accordance with this paragraph. 
(b) Mandatory Prepayments. The Borrower shall prepay the Advances on each Payment Date in the manner and to the extent provided in the
Priority of Payments, including as applicable and without limitation, the outstanding Mandatory Amortization Amount, if any, applicable to each applicable Payment Date. 
The Borrower shall provide, in each Monthly Report, notice of the aggregate amounts of Advances that are to be prepaid on the related Payment
Date in accordance with the Priority of Payments.  (c) Borrowing Base Deficiency Cures. 
(i) In addition to any other obligation of the Borrower to cure any Borrowing Base Deficiency pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, if any Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, then the Borrower may eliminate such Borrowing Base Deficiency in its entirety by effecting one or more (or any combination thereof) of the following actions: (A) deposit into or credit to the
Collection Account cash and Eligible Investments, (B) repay Advances (together with all accrued and unpaid costs and expenses of the Agents, Custodian, Collateral Administrator, Securities Intermediary and the Lenders for which the Borrower has
received a reasonably detailed invoice prior to such date of repayment, in each case in respect of the amount so repaid), (C) sell Collateral Loans in accordance with Article X, or (D) during the Reinvestment
Period, pledge additional Collateral Loans as Collateral. For the avoidance of doubt, no Prepayment Fee shall be required in connection with any prepayment of an Advance made to cure a Borrowing Base Deficiency. 
(ii) In connection with the proposed repayment of Advances or pledge of additional Collateral Loans as Collateral pursuant to
Section 2.05(c)(i), the Borrower (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) shall deliver in accordance with Section 2.05(a), (x) to the Administrative Agent (with a copy to the Collateral
Agent, the Collateral Administrator and the Custodian), notice of such repayment or pledge and a duly completed Borrowing Base Calculation Statement, updated to the date such repayment or pledge is being made and giving pro forma effect to
such repayment or pledge, and (y) to the Administrative Agent, if applicable, a description of any Collateral Loans and each Obligor of such Collateral Loan to be pledged. 
(iii) Until such time as any Borrowing Base Deficiency has been cured in full and no other Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Borrower shall not request the right to transfer (by sale, dividend, distribution or otherwise), and the Borrower shall not request that the Collateral Agent grant the release of any Lien on, or the

  -71- 





transfer of, any Collateral Loan from the Collateral, other than (i) any transfer that complies with Section 10.01(a) or (ii) in connection with the settlement
of purchases or sales of Collateral Loans committed to be acquired or sold by the Borrower prior to the occurrence of such Borrowing Base Deficiency that have not yet settled. 
(d) Additional Prepayment Provisions. Each prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be subject to
Section 2.04(d) and applied to the Advances in accordance with the Lenders respective Percentages. 
Section 2.06 Changes of Commitments 
(a) Automatic Reduction and Termination. The Commitments of all Lenders shall be automatically reduced to zero at 5:00 p.m. on the
Commitment Termination Date.  (b) Optional Termination or Reductions. Prior to the Final Maturity Date, the Borrower shall have the
right to terminate or reduce the unused amount of the Facility Amount at any time or from time to time without any fee or penalty, except as specified in Section 2.12(b), upon not less than two (2) Business Days
prior notice (or such shorter period as the Administrative Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion) to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lenders, the Collateral Administrator and the Custodian of each such termination or
reduction, which notice shall specify the effective date of such termination or reduction and the amount of any such reduction; provided that any notice received after 3:00 p.m. shall be deemed to be received on the next Business Day;
provided, further, that (i) the amount of any such reduction of the Facility Amount shall be equal to at least $500,000 or an integral multiple of $10,000 in excess thereof or, if less, the remaining unused portion thereof (or, in
the case of an Eligible Currency (other than Dollars), no minimum amount or integral multiple), and (ii) no such reduction will reduce the Facility Amount below the sum of (x) the aggregate principal amount of Advances Outstanding at such
time and (y) the Unfunded Reserve Required Amount. Such notice of termination or reduction shall be irrevocable (provided that any such notice may be conditioned upon the happening or occurrence of a specified event, and thereafter
revoked in the event that such specified event does not occur) and shall be effective only upon receipt by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lenders, the Collateral Administrator and the Custodian, and shall attach, in the case of
a reduction of the Commitments, a Borrowing Base Calculation Statement. Each reduction of Commitments of the Lenders hereunder shall be applied pro rata to reduce the respective Commitments of each Lender. 
(c) Effect of Termination or Reduction. The Commitments of the Lenders once terminated or reduced may not be reinstated. Each reduction
of the Facility Amount pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall be applied ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. 
Section 2.07 Maximum Lawful Rate 
It is the intention of the parties hereto that the interest on the Advances shall not exceed the maximum rate permissible under Applicable Law.
Accordingly, anything herein or in any Note to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event any interest is charged to, collected from or received from or on behalf of the Borrower by the Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto in excess of

  -72- 





such maximum lawful rate, then the excess of such payment over that maximum shall be applied first to the payment of amounts then due and owing by the Borrower to the Secured Parties under this
Agreement (other than in respect of principal of and interest on the Advances) and then to the reduction of the outstanding principal amount of the Advances Outstanding. 
Section 2.08 Several Obligations 
The failure of any Lender to make any Advance to be made by it on the date specified therefor shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation to make its Advance on such date. None of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Custodian, the Securities Intermediary or the Collateral Administrator, shall be responsible for the failure of any Lender to make any Advance,
and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make an Advance required to be made by such other Lender. 
Section 2.09 Increased Costs 
(a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, compulsory loan, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for account of, or credit extended by, any Affected Person (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate); 
(ii) subject any Secured Party to any Taxes (other than (A) Non-Excluded Taxes,
(B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other
obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or  (iii) impose on any Affected
Person or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes), affecting this Agreement or Advances made by such Affected Person by reference to the LIBOR Rate or any participation therein; 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to any Affected Person of making, continuing, converting into or
maintaining any Advance (or of maintaining its obligation to make any Advance) or to increase the cost to, or to reduce the amount of any payment (whether of principal, interest, fees, compensation or otherwise) or sum received or receivable by,
such Affected Person hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees, compensation or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Affected Person from time to time after receipt of a written demand by a Responsible Officer of such Affected Person
in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Affected Person for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such demand. If a Lender requests compensation by the
Borrower under this Section 2.09, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender, suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue Advances by reference to the LIBOR Rate, until the event or condition giving rise to
such request ceases to be in effect (in which case (x) all Advances of such Lender shall be made or continued by reference to the Base Rate and (y) such Lender shall have no obligation to make any Advances by reference to the LIBOR Rate);
provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation required in accordance with this Agreement. 
  -73- 




(b) Capital Requirements. If any Affected Person determines that any Change in Law
regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have (but for the operation of this Section 2.09) the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Affected Persons capital or on the capital of such Affected
Persons holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement (or arising in connection herewith) or the Advances made by such Affected Person to a level below that which such Affected Person or such Affected Persons holding
company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Affected Persons policies and the policies of such Affected Persons holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity coverage) by an
amount deemed to be material by such Affected Person, then any such Affected Person shall give the Borrower (and the Collateral Manager) prompt notice thereof and from time to time after written demand by such Affected Person, the Borrower will pay
to such Affected Person in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Affected Person or such Affected Persons holding company for any such reduction suffered or charge imposed on the Payment Date after the
Borrowers receipt of such demand.  (c) [Reserved.] 
(d) Calculation. In determining any amount provided for in this Section 2.09, the Affected Person may use any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods. The Administrative Agent, on behalf of any Affected Person making a claim under this Section 2.09, shall submit to the Borrower and the Collateral Manager a certificate of a
Responsible Officer of the Affected Person setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and the computations of such additional or increased costs, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such amount
shown as due on any such certificate on the next Payment Date after receipt thereof.  (e) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the
part of any Affected Person to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Affected Person right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate an Affected
Person pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Affected Person notifies the Borrower and the Collateral Manager of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions and of such Affected Persons intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
(f) Lending Office. Upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the Borrowers obligation to pay additional amounts to a Lender
pursuant to clauses (a) or (b) of this Section 2.09, such Lender will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to
designate a different lending office if such designation would reduce or obviate the obligations of the Borrower to make future payments of such additional amounts; provided that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its
lending office suffer no material unreimbursed cost or material legal or regulatory disadvantage (as reasonably determined by such Lender), with the object of avoiding future consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of any such
provision. 
  -74- 




Section 2.10 Compensation; Breakage Payments. The Borrower agrees to compensate
each Affected Person from time to time, on the Payment Dates (or the applicable date of prepayment) following such Affected Persons written request (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amounts) in
accordance with the Priority of Payments, for all reasonable and documented losses, expenses and liabilities (including any interest paid by such Affected Person to lenders of funds borrowed to make or carry an Advance bearing interest that was
computed by reference to the LIBOR Rate and any loss sustained by such Affected Person in connection with the re-employment of such funds but excluding loss of anticipated profits), which such Affected Person
may sustain: (i) if for any reason (including any failure of a condition precedent set forth in Article III but excluding a default by the applicable Lender) a Borrowing of any Advance bearing interest that was
computed by reference to the LIBOR Rate by the Borrower does not occur on the Borrowing Date specified therefor in the applicable Notice of Borrowing delivered by the Borrower, (ii) if any payment, prepayment or conversion of any of the
Borrowers Advances bearing interest that was computed by reference to the LIBOR Rate occurs on a date that is not a Payment Date, and (iii) if any payment or prepayment of any Advance bearing interest that was computed by reference to the
LIBOR Rate is not made on a Payment Date or pursuant to a Notice of Prepayment given by the Borrower. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.10 submitted to the Borrower by any Lender (with a
copy to the Agents, and accompanied by a reasonably detailed calculation of such amounts and a description of the basis for requesting such amounts) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. 
Section 2.11 Illegality; Inability to Determine Rates 
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in the event of a Disruption Event, then the affected Lender shall promptly notify
the Agents and the Borrower thereof, and such Lenders obligation to make or maintain Advances hereunder based on the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain Advances based on the
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate.  (b) Upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to a Lenders suspending its obligation to make or
maintain Advances based on the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate pursuant to Section 2.11(a), such Lender will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to
designate a different lending office if such designation would enable such Lender to again make and maintain Advances based on the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate; provided that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending
office suffer no unreimbursed cost or material legal or regulatory disadvantage (as reasonably determined by such Lender), with the object of avoiding future consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of any such provision. 
(c) If, prior to the first day of any Interest Accrual Period or prior to the date of any Advance, as applicable, either (i) the
Administrative Agent determines that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for the applicable Advances, or (ii) the Required Lenders determine and notify the Administrative Agent that the

  -75- 





Adjusted Eurodollar Rate with respect to such Advances does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Advances, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify
the Borrower, the Collateral Agent and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Advances based on the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required
Lenders) revokes such notice.  (d) Upon receipt of any notice described in Section 2.11(a) or (c), the
Borrower may revoke any pending request for the making or continuation of an Advance based on the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for an Advance based on the Base Rate. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Advances shall be required to be repaid as a result of any circumstance or determination made pursuant to this Section 2.11. 
Section 2.12 Fees 
(a) Commitment Fee. On each Payment Date, the Borrower shall pay to the Collateral Agent (for the account of the Lenders on a pro rata
basis) the Commitment Fee in the amount set forth in the Administrative Agent and Lender Fee Letter.  (b) Prepayment Fee. If, at any
time prior to the earlier of (x) the one year anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) the occurrence of a Premium Termination Event, the Facility Amount is reduced in whole or in part at the option or election of the Borrower, the Borrower
shall pay to the Collateral Agent (for the account of the Lenders on a pro rata basis), a prepayment fee in the amount set forth in the Administrative Agent and Lender Fee Letter. 
(c) Administrative Agent Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such fees as are mutually agreed to in writing
from time to time by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, including the fees set forth in the Administrative Agent and Lender Fee Letter. 
(d) Collateral Agent, Collateral Administrator, Custodian and Securities Intermediary Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Collateral
Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian and the Securities Intermediary such fees as are mutually agreed to in writing from time to time by the Borrower and the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian and the
Securities Intermediary, including the fees set forth in the Collateral Administration and Agency Fee Letter.  Section 2.13
Rescission or Return of Payment  The Borrower agrees that, if at any time (including after the occurrence of the Final Maturity
Date) all or any part of any payment theretofore made by it to any Secured Party or any designee of a Secured Party is or must be rescinded or returned for any reason whatsoever (including the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower
or any of its Affiliates), the obligation of the Borrower to make such payment to such Secured Party shall, for the purposes of this Agreement, to the extent that such payment is or must be rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in
existence and this Agreement and any other applicable Facility Document shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as to such obligations, all as though such payment had not been made. 
  -76- 




Section 2.14 Default Interest 
During the existence and continuance of an Event of Default arising pursuant to clause (a), clause (b) or clause (h) of
Section 6.01, at the election of the Administrative Agent or Required Lenders (or, in the case of clause (h), automatically), all Obligations shall bear interest at the Default Rate until rescinded by the Administrative
Agent or the Required Lenders. Interest payable at the Default Rate shall be payable on each Payment Date in accordance with the Priority of Payments. 
Section 2.15 Payments Generally 
(a) All amounts owing and payable to any Secured Party, any Affected Person or any Indemnified Party, in respect of the Advances and other
Obligations, including the principal thereof, interest, fees, indemnities, expenses or other amounts payable under this Agreement or any other Facility Document, shall be paid on behalf and at the direction of the Borrower (or the Collateral Manager
on behalf of the Borrower) by the Collateral Agent to the applicable recipient in an Eligible Currency in immediately available funds, on each Payment Date in accordance with the Priority of Payments, and all without counterclaim, setoff, deduction,
defense, abatement, suspension or deferment. Each Lender shall provide wire instructions to the Borrower and the Collateral Agent. Other than with respect to payments on a Payment Date, payments must be received by the Collateral Agent on or prior
to 3:00 p.m. on a Business Day to be remitted by the Collateral Agent on such Business Day to the Lenders; provided that payments received by the Collateral Agent after 3:00 p.m. on a Business Day will be deemed to have been paid on the next
following Business Day. At no time will the Collateral Agent have any duty (express or implied) to fund (or front or advance) any amount owing by the Borrower hereunder. 
(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all computations of interest, fees and other Obligations shall be made on the basis of a
year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed in computing interest on any Advance, the date of the making of the Advance shall be included and the date of payment shall be excluded; provided that, if an Advance is repaid on the same
day on which it is made, one days Interest shall be paid on such Advance. All computations made by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Facility Document shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 (c) Eligible Currency. 
(i) For purposes of Section 9.01(a), any amounts on deposit in the Collection Account denominated in
any Eligible Currency shall be applied on any Payment Date (i) first, to make payments in such Eligible Currency and (ii) second, to make payments in any other Eligible Currency (pro rata based on available amounts from each other
Eligible Currency), as converted by the Collateral Manager using the Applicable Conversion Rate; provided, that such payments shall be subject to availability of such funds pursuant to Section 9.01(a). 
(ii) The Collateral Manager shall instruct the Collateral Agent, no later than the Determination Date immediately preceding
each Payment Date, to convert amounts on deposit in the Collection Account into Dollars to the extent necessary to make payments pursuant to Section 9.01(a), as applicable (as determined by the Collateral Manager using the
Applicable Conversion Rate). 
  -77- 




(iii) Any Principal Proceeds on deposit in the Collection Account
denominated in an Eligible Currency may be converted by the Collateral Manager into another Eligible Currency on any Business Day (other than a Payment Date) using the Applicable Conversion Rate so long as such conversion does not cause Advances
outstanding in any Eligible Currency to exceed the applicable Borrowing Base for such Eligible Currency immediately after giving effect thereto. The Collateral Manager shall provide prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Agent of any such conversion.  Section 2.16 Defaulting Lenders 
(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then,
until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.16(b), to the extent permitted by Applicable Law: 
(i) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or
consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and Section 12.01. 
(ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article IX or otherwise) shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the
Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing), to the funding of any Advance in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Advances under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any
amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth,
so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result
of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; provided that if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such amounts shall be applied to reduce the outstanding Obligations in accordance with the
Priority of Payments; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Advances in respect of which such
Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Advances of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of
any 
  -78- 





Advances of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Advances are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid
or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting
Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  (iii) Certain Fees. No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to
receive any fee payable under Section 2.12(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been
paid to such Defaulting Lender.  (b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a
Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent
applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Advances of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Advances Outstanding to be held on a pro rata basis by the
Lenders in accordance with their Percentages, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower
while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any
claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.  Section 2.17 Right of Setoff
 The Borrower agrees that, in addition to (and without limitation of) any right of set-off that the
Agents or any Lender may otherwise have, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default each of the Agents and the Lenders shall be entitled, at its option, to offset amounts owing by the Agents or such Lender, as the case
may be, to the Borrower, in Dollars or in any other currency (irrespective of the place of payment or booking office of the obligation and regardless of whether such amounts are then due to the Borrower), against any amount payable by the Borrower
to the Agents or such Lender, as the case may be, under this Agreement that is not paid when due; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid
over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.16 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed
held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Agents a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to
which it exercised such right of setoff. For this purpose, any amount owing by the Agents or any Lender to the Borrower may be converted by the Agents or such Lender, as the case may be, into the currency in which the amount payable by the Borrower
to the Agents or such Lender, as the case may be, under this Agreement is denominated at the rate of exchange at which the Agents or such Lender, as the case may be, would be able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, to purchase the
relevant amount of such currency. 
  -79- 




Section 2.18 Lending Offices; Changes Thereto 
Each Lender may at any time or from time to time designate, by written notice to the Administrative Agent to the extent not already reflected

interest in the Collateral and the obligation to make payments as directed by the Administrative Agent, and (vi) to exercise directly the Collateral Managers rights and obligations under this Agreement, including the exercise of rights

after the Business Day on which such direction was given to the Collateral Manager; provided that no such direction or lapse of time shall be required after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Collateral Manager Default.
Nevertheless, if so requested by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall ratify and confirm any such sale or other disposition by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent all proper bills of sale, assignments, releases and other
instruments as may be designated in any such request.  (b) No person to whom this power of attorney is presented as authority for the
Administrative Agent to take any action or actions contemplated by clause (a) shall inquire into or seek confirmation from the Borrower as to the authority of the Administrative Agent to take any action described below, or
as to the existence of or fulfillment of any condition to the power of attorney described in clause (a), which is intended to grant to the Administrative Agent unconditionally the authority to take and perform the actions
contemplated herein, and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Borrower irrevocably waives any right to commence any suit or action, in law or equity, against any person or entity that acts in reliance upon or acknowledges the authority
granted under this power of attorney. The power of attorney granted in clause (a) is coupled with an interest and may not be revoked or canceled by the Borrower until all obligations of the Borrower under the Facility
Documents have been Paid in Full and the Administrative Agent has provided its written consent thereto. 
  -113- 




(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the power of attorney granted pursuant
to this Section 6.03 shall only be exercisable after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default. 
Section 6.04 Sales 
(a) Each of the Borrower and the Collateral Manager recognizes that an Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all of the
Collateral and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof. Each of the Borrower and the Collateral Manager acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale
were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agree that any such private sale shall not be deemed to have been made in a commercially unreasonable manner solely by virtue of being a private sale. 
(b) Each of the Borrower and the Collateral Manager further agrees that a breach of any of their covenants contained in this
Section 6.04 will cause irreparable injury to the Agents, that the Agents have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this
Section 6.04 shall be specifically enforceable against the Borrower and the Collateral Manager, and each of the Borrower and the Collateral Manager hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for
specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that there has been a Payment in Full.  (c) Pursuant to the UCC, each of the
Borrower and the Collateral Manager hereby specifically agrees (x) that it shall not raise any objection to a Secured Partys purchase of the Collateral (through bidding on the obligations or otherwise) and (y) that a foreclosure sale
conducted in conformity with the principles set forth in various no action letters promulgated by the SEC staff (1) shall be considered to be a public sale for purposes of the UCC and (2) shall be considered to be commercially
reasonable notwithstanding that a Secured Party purchases the Collateral at such a sale.  (d) Each of the Borrower and the Collateral
Manager agrees that the Collateral Agent shall not have any general duty or obligation to make any effort to obtain or pay any particular price for any Collateral sold by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement. The Collateral Agent may, at
the direction of the Administrative Agent, among other things, accept the first bid received, or decide to approach or not approach any potential purchasers. Each of the Borrower and the Collateral Manager hereby agrees that the Collateral Agent
shall have the right to conduct, and shall not incur any liability as a result of, the sale of any Collateral, or any part thereof, at any sale conducted in a commercially reasonable manner, it being agreed by the parties hereto that some or all of
the Collateral is or may be of one or more types that threaten to decline speedily in value. The Borrower and the Collateral Manager hereby waive any claims against the Secured Parties arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any of the
Collateral may have been sold at a private sale was less than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Borrowers obligations under the Agreement, even if the Collateral Agent accepts
the first bid received and does not offer any Collateral to more than one bidder. Without in any way limiting the Collateral Agents right to conduct a foreclosure sale in any manner which is considered commercially reasonable, each of the
Borrower and the Collateral Manager hereby agrees that any foreclosure sale conducted in accordance with the following provisions shall be considered a commercially reasonable sale, and each of the Borrower and the Collateral Manager hereby
irrevocably waives any right to contest any such sale conducted in accordance with the following provisions: 
  -114- 




(i) the Collateral Agent conducts such foreclosure sale in the State of New
York;  (ii) such foreclosure sale is conducted in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York; and 
(iii) not more than thirty days before, and not less than two Business Days in advance of such foreclosure sale, the Collateral
Agent notifies the Borrower and the Collateral Manager at the address set forth herein of the time and place of such foreclosure sale.  (e)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any Facility Document, in connection with any liquidation or disposition of the Collateral, including without limitation, upon the termination of the Commitments following the occurrence and
during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Equityholder and/or any of its Affiliates shall have the right to purchase the Collateral subject to such liquidation or at a purchase price at least equal to the sum of the then accrued and
outstanding Obligations, as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. Any such party may exercise such right by delivering written notice to the Administrative Agent (an Exercise Notice) which shall include a proposed
purchase price and be delivered not later than one (1) Business Day after the date on which the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent of the occurrence of such Event of Default and termination of the Commitments, as applicable,
and the intent of the Administrative Agent to liquidate or dispose of the Collateral, and which Exercise Notice shall set forth evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that the Equityholder has access to sufficient capital to
consummate such purchase in accordance with this clause (e). Once an Exercise Notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent, the delivering party (or its designated Affiliate or managed fund) shall be obligated, irrevocably and unconditionally, to
purchase the Collateral, at the price referenced above, for settlement within the normal settlement period for such Collateral. The cash purchase price must be received no later than ten (10) Business Days following delivery of the Exercise
Notice. Neither the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall assert any right or remedy in respect of the Collateral, including any right described in Section 6.02(b) or
Section 7.03, or cause the removal of the Collateral Manager pursuant to Section 14.08, or cause the liquidation or disposition of the Collateral Loans to occur, in each case during the time that
the Equityholder and its Affiliates are entitled to provide an Exercise Notice and purchase the Collateral pursuant to this Section 6.04(e).

If and only if all Obligations have been Paid in Full, the Administrative Agent shall provide notice of the same to the Collateral Agent and
the Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, the Collateral Agents Lien over the Collateral on behalf of the Secured Parties shall be automatically terminated and shall, at the expense of the Borrower, promptly execute, deliver and

shall also promptly release or terminate the Secured Parties security interest in the Collateral in connection with any sale of Collateral permitted under this Agreement. The Secured Parties acknowledge and agree that upon the sale or
disposition of any Collateral by the Borrower in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the security interest of the Secured Parties in such Collateral shall immediately and automatically terminate without further act, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly provide notice of the same to the Collateral Agent, and the Collateral Agent shall, on behalf of the Secured Parties and at the expense of the Borrower, execute, deliver and authorize for filing such instruments

 (a) The Collateral Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other Secured Parties) shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured
party under the UCC and other Applicable Law. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, and subject to Section 6.04(e), the Collateral Agent or its designees shall, acting solely at the written
direction of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders acting through the Administrative Agent, (i) instruct the Borrower to deliver any or all of the Collateral, the Related Documents and any other document relating to the Collateral to

direction of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (acting through the Administrative Agent), the Collateral Agent shall take no action. The Collateral Agent shall not be liable to the
Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders or any other party for any action taken or omitted to be taken at the direction of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (acting through the Administrative Agent) or any inaction in the absence
thereof.  (b) The Borrower hereby agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, and subject to
Section 6.04(e), at the request of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (acting through the Administrative Agent), it shall execute all documents and agreements which are necessary or appropriate to have the
Collateral assigned to the Collateral Agent or its designee. For purposes of taking the actions described in clauses (a) through (b) of this Section 7.03 the Borrower hereby irrevocably
appoints the Collateral Agent as its attorney-in-fact (which appointment being coupled with an interest and is irrevocable until the Obligations are Paid in Full), with
power of substitution, in the name of the Collateral Agent or in the name of the Borrower or otherwise, for the use and benefit of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, but at the cost and expense of the Borrower and, except
as expressly required by Applicable Law, without notice to the Borrower. Such appointment shall in no way impose upon the Collateral Agent any obligation to take any such action unless specifically directed to do so and subject to the receipt of an
indemnity from the Lenders reasonably satisfactory to it.  Section 7.04 Remedies Cumulative 
Each right, power, and remedy of the Agents and the other Secured Parties, or any of them, as provided for in this Agreement or in the other
Facility Documents or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other right, power, or remedy provided for in this Agreement or in the other Facility
Documents or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Agents or any other Secured Party of any one or more of such rights, powers, or remedies shall not preclude
the simultaneous or later exercise by such Persons of any or all such other rights, powers, or remedies.  Section 7.05 Related
Documents  (a) Each of the Borrower and the Collateral Manager hereby agrees that, to the extent not expressly prohibited by the terms
of the Related Documents, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, it shall (i) upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, promptly forward to the Administrative Agent all material information and
notices which it receives under or in connection with the Related Documents relating to the Collateral, and (ii) upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, act and refrain from acting in respect of any request, act, decision or vote
under or in connection with the Related Documents relating to the Collateral only in accordance with the direction of the Administrative Agent (in its reasonable discretion). 
(b) The Borrower agrees that, to the extent the same shall be in the Borrowers possession, it will hold all Related Documents relating to
the Collateral in trust for the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties, and upon request of the Administrative Agent following 
  -118- 





the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or as otherwise provided herein, promptly deliver the same to the Collateral Agent or its designee. In addition, in accordance
with this Agreement, promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) following its acquisition of any Collateral Loan, the Borrower shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Custodian the Required Loan Documents (to the extent
in the possession of the Collateral Manager or the Borrower, or otherwise available to the Collateral Manager on the relevant deal site). 
Section 7.06 Borrower Remains Liable 
(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Borrower shall remain liable under the contracts and agreements to which it
is a party included in and relating to the Collateral (including the Related Documents) to the extent set forth therein, and shall perform all of its duties and obligations under such contracts and agreements to the same extent as if this Agreement
had not been executed, and (ii) the exercise by any Secured Party of any of its rights hereunder shall not release the Borrower from any of its duties or obligations under any such contracts or agreements included in the Collateral. 
(b) No obligation or liability of the Borrower is intended to be assumed by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party under or as a
result of this Agreement or the other Facility Documents, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including under any Related Document or any other agreement or document that relates to Collateral and, to the maximum extent permitted
under provisions of Law, the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties expressly disclaim any such assumption.  Section 7.07
Protection of Collateral  The Borrower shall from time to time execute and deliver all such supplements and amendments hereto and
file or authorize the filing of all such UCC-1 financing statements and continuation statements, instruments of further assurance and other instruments, and shall take such other action as may be necessary to
secure the rights and remedies of the Secured Parties hereunder and to:  (a) grant security more effectively on all or any portion of the
Collateral;  (b) maintain, preserve and perfect any grant of security made or to be made by this Agreement including the first-priority nature of the Lien (subject to Permitted Liens) or carry out more effectively the purposes hereof; 
(c) perfect or protect the validity of any grant made or to be made by this Agreement (including any and all actions necessary or desirable as
a result of changes in Applicable Law);  (d) enforce any of the Collateral or other instruments or property included in the Collateral;
 (e) preserve and defend title to the Collateral and the rights therein of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties in the Collateral
against the claims of all third parties; and 
  -119- 




(f) pay or cause to be paid any and all Taxes levied or assessed upon all or any part of the
Collateral (other than Taxes which are being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings and against which adequate reserves are being maintained in accordance with GAAP). 
If the Borrower fails to prepare and file any instrument or to take any action required pursuant to this
Section 7.07 within ten (10) Business Days after the Administrative Agents request and written instruction therefor, the Borrower hereby designates the Collateral Agent as its agent to prepare and file such
instrument and take such action required pursuant to this Section 7.07. The Borrower further authorizes, but does not obligate, the Collateral Agent to file UCC-1 financing statements
and continuation statements therefor, that name the Borrower as debtor and the Collateral Agent as secured party and that describes all assets in which the debtor now or hereafter has rights (or words of similar effect) as the Collateral
in which the Collateral Agent has a grant of security hereunder. Such designation shall not impose upon the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, or release or diminish, the Borrowers obligations under this
Section 7.07.  Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower shall, not earlier than six
(6) months and not later than one (1) month prior to the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date of filing of any financing statement filed pursuant to this Agreement authorize, deliver and file or cause to be filed an appropriate continuation
statement with respect to each such financing statement.  ARTICLE VIII 
ACCOUNTS, ACCOUNTINGS AND RELEASES

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Administrative Agent may and the Collateral Agent shall at the direction of the
Administrative Agent (or the Required Lenders acting through the Administrative Agent) demand payment or delivery of, and shall receive and collect, directly and without intervention or assistance of any fiscal agent or other intermediary, all Money
and other property payable to or receivable by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement, including all payments due on the Collateral, in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall segregate and
hold all such Money and property received by it in trust for the Secured Parties and shall apply it as provided in this Agreement. Each Covered Account shall be established and maintained under the Account Control Agreement with a Qualified
Institution. Any Covered Account may contain any number of subaccounts for the convenience of the Collateral Agent or as required by the Collateral Manager for convenience in administering the Covered Accounts or the Collateral. 
Section 8.02 Collection Account 
(a) In accordance with this Agreement and the Account Control Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall, on or prior to the Closing Date, establish
at the Custodian two (2) segregated trust accounts, one of which will be designated the Interest Collection Account and one of which designated the Principal Collection Account (collectively, the
Collection Account), which 
  -120- 





shall be maintained by the Borrower with the Custodian in accordance with the Account Control Agreement and which shall be subject to the Lien of the Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent shall
from time to time deposit into the Interest Collection Account promptly upon receipt thereof all Interest Proceeds received by the Collateral Agent and identified as such by the Collateral Manager. The Collateral Agent shall from time to time
deposit into the Principal Collection Account promptly upon receipt thereof all Principal Proceeds (unless simultaneously reinvested in additional Collateral Loans in accordance with Article X or required to be deposited in
the Unfunded Reserve Account pursuant to Section 8.05) received by the Collateral Agent and identified as such by the Collateral Manager. All funds deposited from time to time in the Collection Account pursuant to this
Agreement shall be held on behalf of the Collateral Agent as part of the Collateral and shall be applied to the purposes herein provided. 
(b) At any time when reinvestment is permitted pursuant to Article X, the Collateral Manager on behalf of the
Borrower (subject to compliance with Article X) may, by delivery of written instructions (which may be a .pdf or similar file sent by email) of a Responsible Officer of the Collateral Manager to the Collateral Agent and the
Collateral Administrator, direct the Collateral Agent to, and upon receipt of such instructions the Collateral Agent shall, withdraw funds on deposit in the Collection Account representing Principal Proceeds (together with accrued interest received
with regard to any Collateral Loan and Interest Proceeds but only to the extent used to pay for accrued interest on an additional Collateral Loan) and reinvest such funds in additional Collateral Loans in accordance with such instructions. If at any
time the amount on deposit in the Unfunded Reserve Account is less than the Unfunded Reserve Required Amount, the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Borrower) may, by delivery of written instructions (which may be a .pdf or similar file sent by
email) of a Responsible Officer of the Collateral Manager to the Collateral Agent and the Collateral Administrator, direct the Collateral Agent to, and upon receipt of such instructions the Collateral Agent shall, withdraw funds on deposit in the
Collection Account representing Principal Proceeds and remit such funds as so directed by the Collateral Manager to meet the Borrowers funding obligations in respect of Delayed Drawdown Collateral Loans or Revolving Collateral Loans. 
Section 8.03 The Payment Account 
In accordance with this Agreement and the Account Control Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall, on or prior to the Closing Date, establish at
the Custodian one (1) segregated trust account, which shall be designated as the Payment Account, which shall be maintained by the Borrower with the Custodian in accordance with the Account Control Agreement and which shall
be subject to the Lien of the Collateral Agent. The only permitted deposits to or withdrawals from the Payment Account shall be in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. All funds on deposit in the Payment Account will remain in un-invested.  Section 8.04 [Reserved] 
Section 8.05 The Unfunded Reserve Account; Fundings 
In accordance with this Agreement and the Account Control Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall, on or prior to the Closing Date, establish at
the Custodian one (1) segregated trust account, which shall be designated as the Unfunded Reserve Account, which shall be maintained by the Borrower with the Custodian in accordance with the Account Control Agreement and
which shall be subject to the Lien of the Collateral Agent. The only permitted deposits to or withdrawals from the Unfunded Reserve Account shall be in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 
  -121- 




On the Acquisition Date of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Loan, Revolving Collateral Loan,
and on any Payment Date, the Collateral Manager shall instruct the Collateral Agent to withdraw funds from the Collection Account for deposit into the Unfunded Reserve Account, to the extent required so that the amount of funds on deposit in the
Unfunded Reserve Account is equal to the Unfunded Reserve Required Amount.  During the Reinvestment Period, fundings of Delayed Drawdown
Collateral Loans and Revolving Collateral Loans shall be made using, first, amounts on deposit in the Unfunded Reserve Account (in an amount equal to the amount on deposit therein with respect to such Delayed Drawdown Collateral Loan or Revolving
Collateral Loan), then available Principal Proceeds and finally, borrowing of Advances under Section 2.01. 
During the Amortization Period, Principal Proceeds received by the Borrower (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) in respect of Revolving
Collateral Loans (to the extent not accompanied by a permanent reduction in the related commitments) shall be deposited by the Borrower (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) into the Unfunded Reserve Account to the extent the amount on deposit
in the Unfunded Reserve Account is less than the Unfunded Reserve Required Amount.  Amounts on deposit in the Unfunded Reserve Account
will be available solely to cover drawdowns on Delayed Drawdown Collateral Loans and Revolving Collateral Loans; provided that, to the extent that the aggregate amount of funds on deposit therein at any time exceeds the Unfunded Reserve
Required Amount, the Collateral Agent shall remit such excess to the Collection Account.  Section 8.06 [Reserved] 
Section 8.07 Account Control Agreement 
The provisions of Sections 8.02 and 8.05 are subject to the terms of the Account Control Agreement. 
Section 8.08 Funds in Covered Accounts; Reports by Collateral Agent 
(a) By delivery of a certificate of a Responsible Officer (which may be in the form of standing instructions), the Borrower (or the Collateral
Manager on behalf of the Borrower) shall at all times direct the Collateral Agent to, and, upon receipt of such certificate, the Collateral Agent shall, invest all funds on deposit in the Collection Account and the Unfunded Reserve Account in
Eligible Investments having stated maturities no later than the Business Day preceding the next Payment Date (or such shorter maturities expressly provided herein). If no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Borrower shall not
have given any such investment directions, the Collateral Agent shall seek instructions from the Collateral Manager within three (3) Business Days after transfer of any funds to such accounts and shall have no obligation to

  -122- 





invest any funds until it shall receive written instructions from the Collateral Manager. After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent shall invest
and reinvest such funds as fully as practicable in Eligible Investments as described in clause (a) of the definition thereof or as otherwise directed by the Collateral Manager maturing not later than the earlier of
(i) thirty (30) days after the date of such investment (unless putable at par to the issuer thereof) or (ii) the Business Day immediately preceding the next Payment Date (or such shorter maturities expressly provided herein). Except
to the extent expressly provided otherwise herein, all interest, gain, loss and other income from such investments shall be deposited, credited or charged (as applicable) in and to the Collection Account. Absent its timely receipt of such
instruction from the Collateral Manager or Administrative Agent, as applicable, in accordance with the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall not be under an obligation to invest (or pay interest on) funds held hereunder. The Collateral Agent shall
in no way be liable for any insufficiency in a Covered Account resulting from any loss relating to any such investment.  (b) The Collateral
Agent agrees to give the Borrower and the Collateral Manager prompt notice if any Covered Account or any funds on deposit in any Covered Account, or otherwise to the credit of a Covered Account, shall become subject to any writ, order, judgment,
warrant of attachment, execution or similar process. All Covered Accounts shall remain at all times with the Custodian or any sub-custodian of the Custodian. 
(c) The Collateral Agent shall supply, in a timely fashion, to the Borrower and the Collateral Manager any information regularly maintained by
the Collateral Agent that the Borrower or the Collateral Manager may from time to time reasonably request with respect to the Collateral Loans, the Covered Accounts and the other Collateral and provide any other requested information reasonably
available to the Collateral Agent and required to be provided by Section 8.09 or to permit the Collateral Manager to perform its obligations hereunder or the Borrowers obligations hereunder that have been delegated to
the Collateral Manager. The Collateral Agent shall promptly forward to the Collateral Manager copies of notices, periodic financial reports and other writings received by it from the Obligor of any Collateral Loan or from any Clearing Agency with
respect to any Collateral Loan.  Section 8.09 Accountings 
(a) Monthly. Not later than the second (2nd) Business Day prior to each Payment
Date (the Monthly Reporting Date), the Borrower shall compile and provide (or cause to be compiled and provided) to the Administrative Agent and the Equityholder a monthly report (which includes a Borrowing Base Calculation
Statement prepared by the Collateral Manager and provided to the Collateral Administrator for inclusion in the Monthly Report) (each, a Monthly Report) in accordance with this Section 8.09. The Borrower
shall compile and provide (or cause to be compiled and provided) to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Administrator a loan data file (the Data File) for the previous monthly period ending on the Monthly Report
Determination Date (containing such information agreed upon by the Borrower (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf), the Collateral Administrator and the Administrative Agent). The Borrower shall provide (or cause to be provided) the Data File no
later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the Monthly Reporting Date. As used herein, the Monthly Report Determination Date with respect to any calendar month will be the last calendar day of the prior calendar month.
The first Monthly Report shall be delivered prior to the second Business Day preceding the Payment 
  -123- 





Date occurring in February 2021 and shall be used in connection with the payments to be made on the Payment Date occurring in February 2021. The Monthly Report for a calendar month shall be in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit I and shall contain the information with respect to the Collateral Loans and Eligible Investments included in the Collateral set forth in Schedule 2, and shall be
determined as of the Monthly Report Determination Date for such calendar month.  In addition, the Borrower shall provide in each Monthly
Report (or supplement thereto) (i) an accounting determined as of the close of business on each Determination Date preceding a Payment Date and (ii) a statement notifying of any amendment, modification or waiver under any Related Document
for each Collateral Loan that constitutes a Material Modification that became effective since the immediately preceding Monthly Report (or, in respect of the first Monthly Report, from the Closing Date) unless previously disclosed under
Section 5.01(d)(vii) or 8.09(a).  (b) Failure to Provide Accounting. If the Collateral Agent shall
not have received any accounting provided for in this Section 8.09 on the first Business Day after the date on which such accounting is due to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent shall notify the Borrower, who shall
use reasonable efforts to obtain such accounting by the applicable Payment Date.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower has engaged the
Collateral Administrator pursuant to Article XV hereof to compile and provide the information and reports to be provided in this Section 8.09; provided, however, that the Collateral
Administrators obligation to compile and provide such information and reports is subject to the receipt of the information necessary to do so from the Collateral Manager and the Administrative Agent. 
Section 8.10 Release of Collateral 
(a) If no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may, by delivery of a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the
Collateral Manager delivered to the Collateral Agent and the Custodian on or prior to the settlement date for any sale of any item of Collateral certifying that the sale of such Collateral is being made in accordance with
Section 10.01 and such sale complies with all applicable requirements of Section 10.01, direct the Collateral Agent (or the Custodian on its behalf) to release or cause to be released such item
from the Lien of this Agreement and, upon receipt of such certificate, the Collateral Agent (or Custodian, as applicable) shall deliver any such item, if in physical form, duly endorsed to the broker or purchaser designated in such certificate or,
if such item is a Clearing Corporation Security, cause an appropriate transfer thereof to be made, in each case against receipt of the sales price therefor as specified by the Collateral Manager in such certificate; provided that the
Collateral Agent (or the Custodian on its behalf) may deliver any such item in physical form for examination in accordance with street delivery custom; provided, further, that neither the Collateral Agent nor the Custodian will be
deemed to have notice of an Event of Default unless it has received notice thereof. 
  -124- 




(b) The Collateral Agent (or Custodian, as applicable) shall, upon the receipt of a
certificate of the Borrower, by delivery of a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Collateral Manager, deliver any Collateral in accordance with such certificate, and execute such documents or instruments as are delivered by or on behalf of
the Borrower and reasonably necessary to release or cause to be released such security from the Lien of this Agreement, which is set for any mandatory call or redemption or payment in full to the appropriate paying agent on or before the date set
for such call, redemption or payment, in each case against receipt of the call or redemption price or payment in full thereof.  (c) As
provided in Section 8.02(a), the Collateral Agent (and its designees) shall deposit any proceeds received by it from the disposition of a Collateral Loan in the Collection Account as instructed by the Collateral Manager,
unless simultaneously applied to the purchase of additional Collateral Loans as permitted under and in accordance with the requirements of this Article VIII and Article X. 
(d) The Collateral Agent shall, upon receipt of a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying that there are no Commitments
outstanding and all Obligations of the Borrower hereunder and under the other Facility Documents have been Paid in Full, execute such documents or instruments as are delivered by or on behalf of the Borrower and reasonably necessary to release any
remaining Collateral from the Lien of this Agreement.  (e) Any security, Collateral Loan or amounts that are released pursuant to
Section 8.10(a) or (b) shall be automatically released from the Lien of this Agreement.  (f) Any
direction received by the Collateral Agent or the Custodian, as applicable, on or prior to 5:00 (p.m.) on any Business Day shall be effective on such Business Day and any direction received by the Collateral Agent or the Custodian, as applicable,
after 5:00 (p.m.) on any Business Day, or at any time on any day that is not a Business Day, shall be effective in each case on the next succeeding Business Day. 
Section 8.11 Reports by Independent Accountants 
(a) The Collateral Manager will appoint Protiviti, Inc. or another independent audit or consulting firm specializing in securitization
transactions (together with its successors, the Independent Accountants) reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent to review and deliver the reports of such accountants required by this Agreement. The fees of such
Independent Accountants and any successor shall be payable by the Borrower.  (b) The Collateral Manager shall cause the Independent
Accountants to furnish to the Administrative Agent (with a copy to the Collateral Agent) within 120 days following the end of each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2021 (each such date, a Report
Date), a report relating to a selection of Monthly Reports (as agreed by the Collateral Manager and the Administrative Agent), delivered during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding such Report Date, to the effect that such
firm has applied certain agreed-upon procedures approved by the Administrative Agent as of the Closing Date (it being understood that the Borrower shall cause such Independent Accountants to comply with
updates to such agreed-upon procedures from time to time in response to reasonable requests of the Administrative Agent to the extent such the Borrower is able in good faith to cause such compliance without
undue burden or expense) with respect to such reports from the related period and, with respect to the Collateral Managers performance hereunder, to assist the Administrative 
  -125- 





Agent in determining that the Monthly Reports for the related period were prepared in compliance with this Agreement, except for such exceptions as it believes to be immaterial and such other
exceptions as will be set forth in such firms report (including, with respect to any such exceptions, an explanation of how each such exception arose and reflecting the input/explanation of the Collateral Manager thereto). Such reports
pursuant to this clause (b) shall be at the expense of the Borrower. Each such report pursuant to this clause (b) shall include a certification by the Collateral Manager as to whether a Collateral Manager
Default occurred during the related testing period and, if any occurred, an explanation as to its resolution.  (c) In the event the
Independent Accountants require the Collateral Agent or the Collateral Administrator, as applicable, to agree to the procedures performed by such Independent Accountants with respect to any of the reports, statements of such Independent Accountants,
or sign any agreement in connection therewith, the Collateral Agent or the Collateral Administrator, as applicable, is hereby directed by the Borrower, to so agree to the terms and conditions requested by such Independent Accountants as a condition
to receiving documentation required by this Agreement; it being understood and agreed that the Collateral Agent and the Collateral Administrator shall deliver such agreement in conclusive reliance on such direction and shall make no inquiry
or investigation as to, and shall have no obligation or responsibility in respect of, the terms of the engagement of such Independent Accountants by the Borrower or the sufficiency, validity or correctness of the agreed upon procedures in respect of
such engagement. The Collateral Agent and the Collateral Administrator may require the delivery of additional written direction to the execution of any such agreement required for the delivery of any report or statement of such Independent
Accountants to the Collateral Agent and the Collateral Administrator under this Agreement. The Collateral Agent and the Collateral Administrator are hereby authorized, without liability on their part, to execute and deliver any such agreement with
such Independent Accountants, which agreement, to the extent so directed by the Borrower (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Borrower), may include, amongst other things, (i) an acknowledgement that the Borrower has agreed that the
procedures by such Independent Accountants are sufficient for the relevant purposes, (ii) releases by the Collateral Agent and the Collateral Administrator of any claims, liabilities and expenses arising out of or relating to such Independent
Accountants engagement, agreed-upon procedures or any report or statement issued by such Independent Accountants under any such engagement and acknowledgement of other limitations of liability in favor
of such Independent Accountants and (iii) restrictions or prohibitions on the disclosure of any such reports, statements or other information or documents provided to it by such Independent Accountants.

ARTICLE XI  THE AGENTS
 Section 11.01 Authorization and Action 
(a) Each Lender (and, in the case of the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent) hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and, to the extent applicable, the other Facility Documents as are delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof
and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, subject to the terms hereof. No Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein or in the other Facility Documents to which it is a
party or any fiduciary relationship with any Secured Party and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties or obligations or liabilities on the part of such Agent shall be read into this Agreement or any other Facility Document to
which such Agent is a party (if any) as duties on its part to be performed or observed. No Agent shall have or be construed to have any other duties or responsibilities in respect of this 
  -134- 





Agreement or any other Facility Document and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or the other Facility Documents, no
Agent shall be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the written instructions of the Required Lenders
(or, with respect to the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent); provided that such Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes such Agent, in its judgment, to personal liability, cost or expense or which is contrary to
this Agreement, the other Facility Documents or Applicable Law, or would be, in its judgment, contrary to its duties hereunder, under any other Facility Document or under Applicable Law. Each Lender agrees that in any instance in which the Facility
Documents provide that the Administrative Agents consent may not be unreasonably withheld, provide for the exercise of the Administrative Agents reasonable discretion, or provide to a similar effect, it shall not in its instructions (or
by refusing to provide instruction) to the Administrative Agent withhold its consent or exercise its discretion in an unreasonable manner. 
(b) Neither the Collateral Agent nor any officer, agent or representative thereof shall be personally liable for any action taken by any such
Person in accordance with any notice given by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other Facility Document even if, at the time such action is taken by any such Person, the Administrative
Agent or the Required Lenders or Persons purporting to be the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders are not entitled to give such notice. If any dispute or disagreement shall arise as to the allocation of any sum of money received by the
Collateral Agent hereunder or under any Facility Document, the Collateral Agent shall have the right to deliver such sum to a court of competent jurisdiction and therein commence an action for interpleader. 
(c) If in performing its duties under this Agreement, the Collateral Agent is required to decide between alternative courses of action, it may
request written instructions from the Administrative Agent as to the course of action desired by it. If the Collateral Agent does not receive such instructions within five (5) Business Days after it has requested them, the Collateral Agent may,
but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking any such courses of action. The Collateral Agent shall act in accordance with instructions received after such five (5) Business Day period except to the extent it has already, in good
faith, taken or committed itself to take, action inconsistent with such instructions.  (d) Instructions to Collateral Agent. 
(i) The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action unless it has such instruction (in the form of
Proper Instructions) from the Borrower (or the Collateral Manager on the Borrowers behalf) the Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, as it reasonably deems necessary. In the absence of gross negligence, fraud or willful
misconduct by the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent shall have no liability for any action (or forbearance from action) taken pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other Facility Document or pursuant to any Proper Instruction of the
Borrower, the Collateral Manager, the Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as applicable.

obtain any communications or information pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement, it shall be entitled to receive the same in writing, in form, content and medium reasonably acceptable to it and otherwise in accordance with any applicable
term of this Agreement; and whenever any report or other information is required to be produced or distributed by the Collateral Agent it shall be in form, content and medium reasonably acceptable to it and the Borrower, and otherwise in accordance
with any applicable term of this Agreement.  (iii) In case any reasonable question arises as to its duties hereunder, the
Collateral Agent may, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, request written instructions from the Collateral Manager and may, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, request written
instructions from the Administrative Agent, and shall be entitled at all times to refrain from taking any action unless it has received written instructions from the Collateral Manager or the Administrative Agent, as applicable. The Collateral Agent
shall, in the absence of gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct by the Collateral Agent, have no liability, risk or cost for any action taken pursuant to and in compliance with the written instruction of the Administrative Agent.

the Collateral Agent of its appointment hereunder is expressly subject to the following terms, which shall govern and apply to each of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (whether or not so stated therein): 
(i) The Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to have notice of any fact, claim or demand with respect hereto unless actually

shall be furnished with acceptable indemnification. Nothing herein shall obligate the Collateral Agent to commence, prosecute or defend legal proceedings in any instance, whether on behalf of the Borrower or on its own behalf or otherwise, with
respect to any matter arising hereunder, or relating to this Agreement or the services contemplated hereby.  (iii) The
permissive right of the Collateral Agent to take any action hereunder shall not be construed as a duty. 
  -136- 




(iv) The Collateral Agent may act or exercise its duties or powers hereunder
through agents or attorneys-in-fact, and the Collateral Agent shall not be liable or responsible for the actions, omissions, negligence or misconduct of any such agent

such a rate have been satisfied, (iii) select, determine or designate any Benchmark Replacement Adjustment, or other modifier to any replacement or successor index, or (iv) determine whether or what Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes
are necessary or advisable, if any, in connection with any of the foregoing. None of the Collateral Agent, the Custodian or the Collateral Administrator shall be liable for any inability, failure or delay on its part to perform any of its duties set
forth in this Agreement or other Facility Document to the extent such inability, failure or delay is a result of the unavailability of the LIBOR Rate (or other applicable rate) and absence of a designated Benchmark Replacement, including as a result
of any inability, delay, error or inaccuracy on the part of any other transaction party in providing any direction, instruction, notice or information required or contemplated by the terms of this Agreement or other Facility Document and reasonably
required for the performance of such duties.  (vi) If at any time the Collateral Agent is served with any judicial or
administrative order, judgment, decree, writ or other form of judicial or administrative process (including orders of attachment or garnishment or other forms of levies or injunctions or stays relating to the transfer of any Collateral), the
Collateral Agent is authorized to comply therewith in any manner as it or its legal counsel of its own choosing deems appropriate, and if the Collateral Agent complies with any such judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, writ or other
form of judicial or administrative process, the Collateral Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person even though such order, judgment, decree, writ or process may be subsequently modified or vacated or otherwise
determined to have been without legal force or effect.  (vii) The Collateral Agent shall have no responsibility or
liability for any loss which may result from any investment or sale of investment made pursuant to this Agreement. The Collateral Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any investment permitted by this Agreement, to deal with itself
(in its individual capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or any such affiliate is acting as agent of the Collateral Agent or for any third person or dealing as principal for its own account. The Collateral Agent shall not

therewith or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection, collectability, priority or sufficiency of thereof or any such other document or the financial condition of any Person or be

sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise or to continue exercising at all or in any manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity any of the rights,
authorities and powers granted or available with respect thereto. No Agent shall have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for the Borrowers, the Collateral Managers, any Lenders, or any other
Persons, as the case may be, performance of, or failure to perform, any of their respective obligations and duties under this Agreement or any other Facility Document. 
(b) No Agent shall be liable for the actions or omissions of any other Agent (including concerning the application of funds), or under any duty
to monitor or investigate compliance on the part of any other Agent with the terms or requirements of this Agreement, any Facility Document or any Related Document, or their duties hereunder or thereunder. Each Agent shall be entitled to assume the
due authority of any signatory and genuineness of any signature appearing on any instrument or document it may receive (including each Notice of Borrowing received hereunder). No Agent shall be liable for any action taken in good faith and
reasonably believed by it to be within the powers conferred upon it, or taken by it pursuant to any direction or instruction by which it is governed, or omitted to be taken by it by reason of the lack of direction or instruction required hereby for
such action (including for refusing to exercise discretion or for withholding its consent in the absence of its receipt of, or resulting from a failure, delay or refusal on the part of the Required Lenders (or with respect to the Collateral Agent,
the Administrative Agent) to provide, written instruction to exercise such discretion or grant such consent from the Required Lenders (or with respect to the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent), as applicable). No Agent shall be liable for
any error of judgment made in good faith unless it is proven by a non-appealable court of competent jurisdiction that such Agent was grossly negligent in ascertaining the relevant facts or engaged in fraud or
willful misconduct. Nothing herein or in any Facility Document or Related Document shall obligate any Agent to advance, expend or risk its own funds, or to take any action which in its reasonable judgment may cause it to incur any expense or
financial or other liability for which it is not adequately indemnified. No Agent shall be liable for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages (including lost profits) whatsoever, even if it has been informed of the likelihood
thereof and regardless of the form of action. No Agent shall be charged with knowledge or notice of any matter unless actually known to a Responsible Officer of such Agent, or unless and to the extent written notice of such matter is received by
such Agent a

on, report, notice, request, consent, entitlement order, approval or other paper or document. Neither Agent shall be liable for any error of judgment, or for any act
done or step taken or omitted by it, in good faith, or for any mistakes of fact or law, or for anything that it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith, except in the case of its willful misconduct or grossly negligent performance or
omission of its duties.  (c) No Agent shall be responsible or liable for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts beyond its
control; provided that such Agent takes commercially reasonable efforts to resume performance after the cessation of such acts. Such acts shall include acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, epidemics, governmental regulations
imposed after the fact, fire, communication line failures, computer viruses, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters. 
  -139- 




(d) The delivery of reports and other documents and information to the Collateral Agent
hereunder or under any other Facility Document is for informational purposes only and the Collateral Agents receipt of such documents and information shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable
from information contained therein. The Collateral Agent is hereby authorized and directed to execute and deliver the other Facility Documents to which it is a party. Whether or not expressly stated in such Facility Documents, in performing (or
refraining from acting) thereunder, the Collateral Agent shall have all of the rights, benefits, protections and indemnities which are afforded to it in this Agreement. 
(e) Each Lender acknowledges that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither Agent has made any representation or warranty to
it, and that no act by either Agent hereafter taken, including any consent and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of the Borrower, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by such Agent to any Secured Party as
to any matter. Each Lender represents to each Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon such Agent and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of, and investigation into, the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the Collateral Manager, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Facility Documents to which it is a party.
Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon either Agent or any other Secured Party and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions
in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the Facility Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and the Collateral Manager. Neither Agent shall have any duty or responsibility to provide any Secured Party with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial or
other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or Collateral Manager which may come into the possession of such Agent. 
Section 11.04 Indemnification 
Each of the Lenders agrees to indemnify and hold the Administrative Agent harmless (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the
Borrower pursuant to Section 12.04 or otherwise) from and against any and all Liabilities which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any other Facility Document or any Related Document or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Facility Document or any Related Document; provided that no Lender shall be liable
to the Administrative Agent for any portion of such Liabilities resulting from the Administrative Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. The rights of the Administrative Agent and obligations of the Lenders under or pursuant to this
Section 11.04 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and the earlier removal or resignation of the Administrative Agent hereunder.

appointment of a successor agent pursuant to this Section 11.05. After the effectiveness of any retiring or removed Agents resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Facility Documents and the provisions of this Article XI shall continue in effect for its benefit with respect to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent

(provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) and the Required Lenders. If the Collateral Agent is removed pursuant to this Section 11.05(c), the Collateral Agent shall be removed in all other
capacities in which it serves under this Agreement and under any of the other Facility Documents (including in its capacity as Custodian), but not in its capacities as Administrative Agent or Lender, if applicable. Any removal of the Collateral
Agent pursuant to this Section 11.05(c) shall be effective upon the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section 11.05(c) and the acceptance of such appointment by such
successor. After the effectiveness of any removal of the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section 11.05(c), the Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Facility
Documents (but not in its capacities as Administrative Agent or Lender, if applicable) and the provisions of this Article XI and Section 11.05(c) shall continue in effect for its benefit with
respect to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Collateral Agent under this Agreement and under the other Facility Documents. In the event a successor Collateral Agent shall not be appointed within such thirty

that each such party is solely responsible to safeguard the use and confidentiality of applicable user and authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys upon receipt by it. None of the Collateral Agent, the Custodian or the Collateral
Administrator shall be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the Collateral Agents, the Custodians or the Collateral Administrators, as applicable, reasonable, good faith reliance upon and
compliance with such instructions, notwithstanding that such directions conflict with or are inconsistent with a subsequent written instruction, subject to the duty of care applicable to such Person acting in such capacity. Each of the other parties
hereto agrees (i) to assume all risks arising out of its respective use of such electronic methods to submit instructions and directions to any of the Collateral Agent, the Custodian or the Collateral Administrator, as applicable, including

informed of the protections and risks associated with the various methods of transmitting instructions to the Collateral Agent, the Custodian or the Collateral Administrator and that there may be more secure methods of transmitting instructions than
the method(s) selected by it, (iii) that the security procedures (if any) to be followed in connection with its transmission of instructions provide to it a commercially reasonable degree of protection in light of its particular needs and
circumstances and (iv) to notify the Collateral Agent, the Custodian or the Collateral Administrator immediately upon learning of any compromise or unauthorized use of the security procedures.

Fill & Sign, Adobe Sign, DocuSign, or any other similar platform identified by such party and reasonably available at no undue burden or expense to the Collateral Agent, the Custodian or the Collateral Administrator) shall be permitted
hereunder notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and such electronic signatures shall be legally binding as if such electronic signatures were handwritten signatures. Any electronically signed document delivered via email from a person
purporting to be a Responsible Officer shall be considered signed or executed by such Responsible Officer on such partys behalf. To the extent received from a Responsible Officer, the parties hereto also hereby acknowledge and agree that the
Collateral Agent, the Custodian and the Collateral Administrator shall have no duty to inquire into or investigate the authenticity or authorization of any such electronic signature and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such electronic
signature without any liability with respect thereto.  Section 12.03 Taxes 
(a) Any and all payments by, or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Facility Document shall be made without deduction or
withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law. If any Applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of the applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the
Borrower, the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent, then the Borrower, the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent (as applicable) shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is a Non-Excluded Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such
deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Secured Party receives an amount (such amount, an Additional Amount) equal
to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.  (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to timely pay (or
at the option of the Administrative Agent, timely reimburse it for the payment of) any present or future stamp, court or documentary, intangible, recording or filing Taxes or any other or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made hereunder,

(c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, each
Secured Party for (i) the full amount of Non-Excluded Taxes (including any Non-Excluded Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section 12.03) paid or payable by any Secured Party (or required to be withheld or deducted from payments to a Secured Party) and (ii) any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case
whether or not such Non-Excluded Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability will be promptly
delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or other Secured Party and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(d) As soon as practicable after the date of any payment of Taxes pursuant to this Section 12.03, the Borrower will
furnish to each Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by the relevant Governmental Authority evidencing payment thereof (or other evidence of payment as may be reasonably satisfactory to such Agent). 
(e) If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund (for this purpose, including credits
elected by such party in lieu of a refund) of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 12.03 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 12.03), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to
such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon t

 Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (e), in no event will the indemnified party
be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (e) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the
indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never
been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
(f) Each Secured Party that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under this Agreement
or any Facility Document shall deliver to the Borrower and each Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or such Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or such Agent as
will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, each Secured Party, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or any Agent, shall deliver such other documentation reasonably requested by the
Borrower or such Agent as will enable the Borrower or such Agent to determine whether or not such Secured Party is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two
sentences, the 
  -149- 





completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in sub-clauses (A),
(B) and (D) of Section 12.03(f)(i)) shall not be required if, in the Secured Partys reasonable judgment, such completion, execution or submission would subject such Secured Party to any material
unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Secured Party.  (i)
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing.  (A) any Secured Party that is a United States Person (as defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agents on or prior to the date on which such Secured Party becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or
the Agents), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Secured Party is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 
(B) any Lender that is not a United States person under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a Non-U.S. Lender) shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Agents (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on
which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a party to under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or an Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 
(1) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to
which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Facility Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other
applicable payments under any Facility Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption
from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; 
(2) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI; 
(3) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for
portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Non-U.S. Lender
is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(C)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or a controlled foreign
corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or 
  -150- 




(4) to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender
is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Non-U.S.
Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Non-U.S. Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender may
provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
(C) any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver
to the Borrower and the Agents (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time
thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or Agents), executed copies of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with
such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Agents to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
(D) if a payment made to a Secured Party under any Facility Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed
by FATCA if such Secured Party were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code as applicable), such Secured Party shall deliver to the Borrower and
the Agents at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agents such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and
such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agents as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agents to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Secured Party has complied with such Secured
Partys obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date
of this Agreement.  Each Secured Party agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes
obsolete or inaccurate in any respect it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Agents in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
(g) Nothing in this Section 12.03 shall be construed to require any Secured Party to make available its Tax returns
(or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
  -151- 




(h) Each Lender shall severally indemnify each Agent, within ten (10) days after demand
therefor, for (i) any Non-Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified such Agent for such
Non-Excluded Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of
Section 12.06(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by such Agent in connection with any Facility
Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
liability delivered to any Lender by the applicable Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes each Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Facility Document or
otherwise payable by such Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to such Agent under this clause (h).  (i)
Each partys obligations under this Section 12.03 shall survive the resignation or replacement of an Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the
repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Facility Documents.  (j) For purposes of this Section, the term
Applicable Law includes FATCA.  Section 12.04 Costs and Expenses; Indemnification 
(a) The Borrower agrees to promptly pay on written demand all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Agents, the
Custodian, the Securities Intermediary and the Collateral Administrator in connection with the preparation, review, negotiation, reproduction, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Facility Documents, including (but limited, in the
case of legal fees and expenses, to) the reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of one outside counsel for the Administrative Agent plus, if necessary, one additional local counsel, one outside counsel for the Collateral Agent, the
Custodian, the Securities Intermediary and the Collateral Administrator and one additional local counsel, if necessary for the Collateral Agent, costs and expenses of creating, perfecting, releasing or enforcing the Collateral Agents security
interests in the Collateral, including filing and recording fees, expenses and taxes, stamp or documentary taxes, search fees, UCC filing fees, and the equivalent thereof in any foreign jurisdiction, and all other related fees and expenses in
connection therewith, and in connection with the administration and any modification or amendment of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Facility Document and advising the Agents, the Custodian, the Securities Intermediary and the Collateral
Administrator as to their respective rights, remedies and responsibilities. The Borrower agrees to promptly pay on written demand all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of each of the Secured Parties in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement (including the enforcement of this
Section 12.04), the Notes or any other Facility Document, including all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
any Secured Party in connection with the preservation, collection, foreclosure or enforcement of the Collateral subject to the Facility Documents or any interest, right, power or remedy of any Secured Party or in connection with the collection or
enforcement of any of the Obligations or the proof, protection, administration or resolution of any claim based upon the Obligations in any insolvency proceeding, including all reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of attorneys (subject
to the limitations set forth in the first 
  -152- 





sentence of this clause (a)), accountants, auditors, consultants, appraisers and other professionals engaged by any Secured Party. Without prejudice to its rights hereunder, the expenses and the
compensation for the services of the Secured Parties are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable insolvency Law. 
(b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Secured Party and each of their Affiliates and the respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, managers of, and any Person controlling any of, the foregoing (each, an Indemnified Party) from and against any and all Liabilities that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party (limited,
solely in the case of Liabilities owing to the Administrative Agent in respect of attorneys fees and expenses, to the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees
and expenses of one outside counsel and one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction), in each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of the execution, delivery, enforcement (including the enforcement of this
Section 12.04), performance, administration of or otherwise arising out of or incurred in connection with this Agreement, any other Facility Document, any Related Document or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby
or the use of proceeds of any Advance (and regardless of whether or not any such transactions are consummated) and regardless of whether or not arising out of a suit, claim or other action brought by the Borrower, the Collateral Manager, the
Equityholder or any third party, except (A) to the extent any such Liability is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from (i) with
respect to the Collateral Agent, Custodian, Collateral Administrator or the Securities Intermediary, the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party or (ii) with respect to any other Indemnified Party, the gross negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party, any of its Affiliates or the respective officers, directors, employees, agents, managers of, and any Person controlling any of, the foregoing, (B) in the case of any Indemnified Party
(other than the Custodian, Collateral Administrator, Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, managers or controlling Persons) to the extent any such Liability results from
a claim brought by the Borrower against an Indemnified Party for a material breach of such Indemnified Partys obligations hereunder or under any other Facility Document, if the Borrower has obtained a final, nonappealable judgment in its favor
on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or (C) to the extent that any such Liability results from a claim solely between or among Lenders and not arising out of any act or omission on the part of the Borrower, the
Collateral Manager or any of their respective Affiliates. In the case of an investigation, litigation or proceeding to which the indemnity in this paragraph applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by the Borrower, any of the Borrowers equityholders or creditors, an Indemnified Party or any other Person, whether or not an Indemnified Party is otherwise a party hereto. The Borrower shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party (or, in the case of a threatened proceeding, could reasonably have been expected to be a
party if such proceeding had been brought) and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement (i) does not include a statement as to or admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on
behalf of any such Indemnified Party or (ii) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. This Section 12.04(b) shall not
apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim. 
  -153- 




Section 12.05 Execution in Counterparts 
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which
counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement. Facsimile signatures and signature pages provided in the form of a
pdf or similar imaged document transmitted by electronic transmission (including .jpeg file or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000, including Orbit, Adobe Sign, DocuSign, or any other similar
platform identified by the Borrower and reasonably available at no undue burden or expense to the Collateral Administrator, Custodian or Collateral Agent) shall be deemed original signatures for all purposes hereunder. Any electronically signed
document delivered via email from a person purporting to be an Authorized Person shall be considered signed or executed by such Authorized Person on behalf of the applicable Person. To the extent received by a Responsible Officer, none of the
Collateral Administrator, Custodian or Collateral Agent shall have a duty to inquire into or investigate the authenticity or authorization of any such electronic signature and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such electronic signature
without any liability with respect thereto.  Section 12.06 Assignability 
(a) Subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 12.06, each Lender may, with the consent of the Borrower
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and the Administrative Agent, assign to any Person all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Advances Outstanding or
interests therein owned by it, together with ratable portions of its Commitment); provided that such consent shall be deemed to have been granted by the Borrower if the Borrower shall not have objected in writing within five (5) Business
Days of receipt of any such request for consent; provided, further, that:  (i) neither the Borrowers
nor the Administrative Agents consent to any such assignment shall be required if the assignee is (A) a Lender or any of its Affiliates or (B) managed by a Lender or any of its Affiliates; 
(ii) the Borrowers consent to any such assignment pursuant to this Section 12.06(a) shall not
be required if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; provided that in no event shall an assignment be made to a Competitor without the Borrowers prior written consent unless an Event of Default arising pursuant to
clause (a), clause (b) or clause (h) of Section 6.01 shall have occurred and be continuing; and 
(iii) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Lender may make an assignment to any Person (other than a
Competitor) with notice to, but without the consent of, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent if such Lender makes a reasonable determination that its ownership of any of its rights or obligations hereunder is prohibited by Applicable Law. 
  -154- 




The parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent
(with a copy to the Collateral Agent) an Assignment and Acceptance and the applicable tax forms required by Sections 12.03(f), together with administrative details for the applicable assignee (if such assignee is not a
current Lender or an Affiliate of Citibank, N.A.). Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 12.06(d), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee
thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement, and to the extent of the interest assigned by such assigning Lender, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 12.06, (x) no assignment may be made to the Borrower, the Collateral Manager, the Equityholder or any of their respective Affiliates and (y) no assignment shall be made to any Defaulting Lender, a natural
person or any Person that, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (y). 
(b) The Borrower may not assign its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders.  (c) (i) Any Lender may, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) to the extent such consent is required for an assignment under Section 12.06(a), sell participations to Participants in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under
this Agreement; provided that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(C) the Borrower, the Agents, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian and the Securities Intermediary and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and
obligations under this Agreement, and (D) each Participant shall have agreed to be bound by this Section 12.06(c), Section 12.06(e), Section 12.09 and
Section 12.16. Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.09 and 12.03 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under
Section 12.03(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 12.03(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment under clause (a) of this Section; provided that such Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.09 or 12.03, with respect to any
participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable
participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.20 with respect to
any Participant.  (ii) In the event that any Lender sells participations in any portion of its rights and obligations
hereunder, such Lender as non-fiduciary agent for the Borrower shall maintain a register on which it enters the name of all participants in the Advances held by it and the principal amount (and stated interest
thereon) of the portion of the Advance which is the subject of the participation (the Participant Register). An Advance may be participated in whole or in part only by registration of such participation on the Participant Register
(and each Note, if any, shall expressly so provide). No Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants
interest in any rights and 
  -155- 





obligations hereunder) to any Person except to the extent necessary to establish that such rights and obligations are in registered form under
Section 5f.103-1 of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent)
shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (d) The Administrative Agent, on behalf of and acting solely for this
purpose as the non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at its address specified in Section 12.02 or such other address as the Administrative Agent shall designate in
writing to the Lenders, a copy of this Agreement, each signature page hereto, each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it, and a register (the Register) for the recordation of the names, addresses and wiring
instructions of the Lenders and the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances Outstanding maintained by each Lender under this Agreement (and any stated interest thereon). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Collateral Manager, the Agents, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, the Securities Intermediary and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a
Lender and the owner of the amounts owing to it under the Facility Documents as reflected in the Register for all purposes of the Facility Documents. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Collateral Manager, the
Collateral Agent or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. An Advance (and a Note, if any, evidencing the same) may be assigned or sold in whole or in part only by registration of such assignment or
sale on the Register (and each Note with respect to the Advances, if any, shall expressly so provide) and compliance with this Section 12.06. 
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any other Facility Document and each Lender hereunder, and each
Participant, must at all times be an accredited investor as defined in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (7) of Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act (an Accredited Investor) and a qualified purchaser as
defined in the Investment Company Act (a Qualified Purchaser). Each Lender severally represents to the Borrower, (i) on the date that it becomes a party to this Agreement (whether by being a signatory hereto or by entering
into an Assignment and Acceptance) and (ii) on each date on which it makes an Advance hereunder, that it is an Accredited Investor and a Qualified Purchaser. 
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 12.06, any Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights (including rights to payment of principal and interest) under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or security interest granted to a Federal Reserve Bank, without
notice to or consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent; provided that no such pledge or grant of a security interest shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or grantee for such
Lender as a party hereto.

any Loan Files delivered to it for all Collateral Loans owned by the Borrower at any time during the term of this Agreement, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (which shall include any addendum hereto which is hereby
incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement), and the Custodian hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to perform the services and duties set forth in this Agreement with respect to it, subject to and in accordance with the provisions
hereof.  (b) Instructions. The Borrower agrees that it shall from time to time provide, or cause to be provided, to the Custodian
all necessary instructions and information, and shall respond promptly to all inquiries and requests of the Custodian as may reasonably be necessary to enable the Custodian to perform its duties hereunder. 
(c) Custodian. The Custodian shall take and retain custody of the Loan Files delivered by the Borrower hereunder in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, all for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties, in order to perfect under the UCC the Collateral Agents security interest therein for the benefit of the Secured Parties. In
taking and retaining custody of the Loan Files, the Custodian shall be deemed to be acting as the agent of Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties; provided that the Custodian makes (a) no warranty or representation and
shall have no responsibility for the enforceability, completeness, validity, sufficiency, value, genuineness, ownership or transferability of the Collateral Loans and (b) no representation as to the existence, perfection or priority of any lien
on the Collateral Loans or the Required Loan Documents. It is expressly agreed and acknowledged that the Custodian is not guaranteeing performance of or assuming any liability for the obligations of the other parties hereto or any parties to the
Collateral Loans.  Section 13.02 Duties of Custodian 
(a) Segregation. All Loan Files held by the Custodian for the account of the Borrower hereunder shall be (a) subject to the lien of

with respect to such Collateral Loans, all Loan Files shall be held in safekeeping by the Custodian, individually segregated from the securities and investments of any other Person and marked so as to clearly identify such Loan Files as the property
of the Borrower as set forth in this Agreement. 
  -163- 




Section 13.03 Delivery of Collateral Loans to Custodian 
(a) The Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Borrower) shall deliver, or cause to be delivered (which may be via email, except for the original
Underlying Note, if any) promptly to the Custodian all of the Loan Files for each Collateral Loan owned by the Borrower at any time during the term of this Agreement at the address identified herein; provided, however, that all
documents (other than the original Underlying Notes) shall be transmitted in electronic format and the Custodian shall only be required to retain the original Underlying Note, if any. The Custodian shall not be responsible for any Collateral Loan or
related Loan File until actually received by it. The Custodian shall notify the Collateral Administrator of the Custodians receipt of any sealed envelopes described in Section 5.01(o) purporting to contain any
original assignment of any Collateral Loan or any original executed Underlying Note with respect to any Collateral Loan.  (b)
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, delivery of the Collateral Loans acquired by the Borrower which constitute Noteless Loans or which are otherwise not evidenced by a security or instrument as defined in Section 8-102 and Section 9-102(a)(47) of the UCC, respectively, shall be made by delivery to the Custodian of a copy of the loan register with respect to such
Noteless Loan evidencing registration of such Collateral Loan on the books and records of the applicable Obligor or bank agent to the name of the Borrower (or its nominee) or a copy (which may be a facsimile copy) of an assignment agreement in favor
of the Borrower as assignee. Any duty on the part of the Custodian with respect to the custody of such Collateral Loans shall be limited to the exercise of reasonable care by the Custodian in the physical custody of the related Loan Files delivered
to it.  (c) In the absence of gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of the Custodian, the Custodian may assume the genuineness of
any document in a Loan File it may receive and the genuineness and due authority of any signatures appearing thereon, and shall be entitled to assume that each document it may receive is what it purports to be on its face. If an original
security or instrument as defined in Section 8-102 and Section 9-102(a)(47) of the UCC, respectively, is or shall be or become
available with respect to any Collateral Loan to be held by the Custodian under this Agreement, it shall be the sole responsibility of the Borrower to make or cause delivery thereof to the Custodian, and the Custodian shall not be under any
obligation at any time to determine whether any such original security or instrument has been or is required to be issued or made available in respect of any Collateral Loan or to compel or cause delivery thereof to the
Custodian.  Section 13.04 Release of Documents/Control By Agents 
(a) The Custodian shall release and ship for delivery, or direct its agents or sub-custodians to

(substantially in the form of Exhibit H and specifying, among other things, the Collateral Loans and Loan Files to be released and delivery instructions and other information as may be necessary to enable the Custodian to release and ship
such Loan Files), which may be standing instructions (in a form acceptable to the Custodian) in accordance with this Agreement. 
  -164- 




(b) Upon receipt by the Custodian from the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent
(acting at the direction of the Administrative Agent), of written notice of the occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing and indicating the Administrative Agents intent to prohibit the Custodian from accepting instructions from or
on behalf of the Borrower (each such notice, a Block Notice), the Custodian shall no longer accept or act upon any Request for Release and Receipt, Proper Instructions or other instructions from the Borrower (or the Collateral
Manager on its behalf) hereunder with respect to the Collateral Loans or the Loan Files. From and after its receipt of a Block Notice, the Custodian shall only comply with Requests for Release and Receipt and Proper Instructions from the Collateral
Agent (acting at the direction of the Administrative Agent) or Administrative Agent.  Section 13.05 Records 
The Custodian shall create and maintain complete and accurate records relating to its activities under this Agreement with respect to the
Collateral Loans or other property of the Borrower held for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties under this Agreement. All such records shall be the property of the Borrower and, upon reasonable advance notice, shall at
all times during the regular business hours of the Custodian be open for inspection by duly authorized officers, employees or agents of the Borrower, the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent. 
Section 13.06 Reporting 
(a) If requested by the Borrower, the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent, the Custodian shall render an itemized report of the Loan

With respect to each Collateral Loan, the Custodian shall deliver to Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days of the end of each month, notice of any Required Loan Documents that have not been furnished to the Data Site. 
(b) The Custodian shall have no duty or obligation to undertake any market valuation of the Collateral Loans under any circumstance. 
Section 13.07 Certain General Terms 
(a) No Duty to Examine Related Documents. Nothing herein shall obligate the Custodian to review or examine the terms of any underlying
instrument, certificate, credit agreement, indenture, loan agreement, promissory note or any other document contained in the Loan Files evidencing or governing any Collateral Loan to determine the validity, sufficiency, marketability or
enforceability of any Collateral Loan (and shall have no responsibility for the genuineness or completeness thereof) or otherwise. 
  -165- 




(b) Resolution of Discrepancies. In the event of any discrepancy between the
information set forth in any report provided by the Custodian to the Borrower and any information contained in the books or records of the Borrower, the Borrower (or the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Borrower) shall promptly notify the
Custodian thereof and the parties shall cooperate to diligently resolve the discrepancy.  (c) Improper Instructions. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Custodian shall not be obligated to take any action (or forebear from taking any action), which it reasonably determines to be contrary to the terms of this Agreement or Applicable Law. In no instance shall the
Custodian be obligated to provide services on any day that is not a Business Day.  (d) Proper Instructions. 
(i) Each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Manager and the Borrower will give a notice to the Custodian, specifying
the names and specimen signatures of Persons authorized to give Proper Instructions (collectively, Authorized Persons and each, an Authorized Person) which notice shall be signed by an Authorized Person set
forth on Schedule 7 or otherwise previously certified to the Custodian. The Custodian shall be entitled to rely upon the identity and authority of such Persons until it receives written notice from an Authorized Person of
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Manager, as applicable, to the contrary. The initial Authorized Persons are set forth on Schedule 7 (as such Schedule 7 may be modified from
time to time by written notice from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Manager as applicable, to the Custodian). 
(ii) The Custodian shall have no responsibility or liability to the Borrower (or any other Person) and shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the Borrower in the event that a subsequent written confirmation of an oral instruction fails to conform to the oral instructions received by the Custodian. The Custodian shall not have an obligation to act in accordance with
purported instructions to the extent that they conflict with Applicable Law or regulations. The Custodian shall not be liable for any loss resulting from a delay while it obtains clarification of any Proper Instruction. 
(e) Evidence of Authority. The Custodian shall be protected in acting upon any instruction, notice, request, consent, certificate
instrument or paper reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been properly executed or otherwise given by or on behalf of the Borrower, the Collateral Manager or Administrative Agent, as applicable, by an Authorized Person thereof. The
Custodian may receive and accept a certificate signed by any Authorized Person as conclusive evidence of:  (i) the
authority of any Person to act in accordance with such certificate; or  (ii) any determination or of any action by such
Person as described in such certificate;  and such certificate may be considered as in full force and effect until receipt by the Custodian
of written notice to the contrary from an Authorized Person of the Borrower, the Collateral Manager or Administrative Agent, as applicable. 
  -166- 




(f) Receipt of Communications. Any communication received by the Custodian on a day
which is not a Business Day or after 5:00 p.m. (or such other time as is agreed by the Borrower and the Custodian from time to time) on a Business Day will be deemed to have been received on the next Business Day; provided that in the case of
communications so received after 5:00 p.m. on a Business Day the Custodian will use its commercially reasonable efforts to process such communications as soon as possible after receipt. 
(g) In the event that (i) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Manager, the Custodian or the Collateral Agent shall be
served by a third party with any type of levy, attachment, writ or court order with respect to any Loan File or a document included within a Loan File or (ii) a third party shall institute any court proceeding by which any Loan File or a
document included within a Loan File shall be required to be delivered other than in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the party receiving such service shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to the other parties to this
Agreement (to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law) copies of all court papers, orders, documents and other materials concerning such proceedings. The Custodian shall, to the extent permitted by Law, continue to hold and maintain all the Loan
Files that are the subject of such proceedings pending a final, nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction permitting or directing disposition thereof. Upon final determination of such court, the Custodian shall dispose of such Loan
File or a document included within such Loan File as directed by the Administrative Agent, which shall give a direction consistent with such determination. Expenses of the Custodian incurred as a result of such proceedings shall be borne by the
Borrower.  Section 13.08 Compensation and Reimbursement of Custodian 
(a) Fees. The Custodian shall be entitled to compensation for its services in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Administration
and Agency Fee Letter.  (b) Expenses. The Borrower agrees to pay or reimburse to the Custodian upon its request from time to time
all reasonable and documented costs, disbursements, advances, and expenses (but limited, in the case of legal fees and expenses, to the reasonable fees and expenses of one firm of outside legal counsel, plus, if necessary, one additional local
counsel) incurred in connection with the preparation or execution of this Agreement, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or the administration of this Agreement or performance by the Custodian of its duties and services under
this Agreement (including costs and expenses of any action deemed necessary by the Custodian to collect any amounts owing to it under this Agreement).

(a) General Duties. The Custodian shall have no duties, obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement or with respect to the
Collateral Loans, except for such duties as are expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement, and the duties and obligations of the Custodian shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement. No implied duties,
obligations or responsibilities shall be read into this Agreement against, or on the part of, the Custodian. 
  -167- 




(b) Instructions. 
(i) The Custodian shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action unless it has such instruction (in the form of Proper
Instructions) from the Borrower (or the Collateral Manager on the Borrowers behalf), the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, as it reasonably deems necessary, and shall be entitled to require, upon notice to the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, that Proper Instructions to it be in writing. In the absence of gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of the Custodian, the Custodian shall have no liability for any
action (or forbearance from action) taken pursuant to this Agreement or any other Facility Document or pursuant to any Proper Instruction of the Borrower, the Collateral Manager, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable. 
(ii) Whenever the Custodian is entitled or required to receive or obtain any communications or information pursuant to or as
contemplated by this Agreement, it shall be entitled to receive the same in writing, in form, content and medium reasonably acceptable to it and otherwise in accordance with any applicable term of this Agreement; and whenever any report or other
information is required to be produced or distributed by the Custodian it shall be in form, content and medium reasonably acceptable to it and the Borrower, and otherwise in accordance with any applicable term of this Agreement. 
(iii) In case any reasonable question arises as to its duties hereunder, the Custodian may, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, request instructions from the Collateral Manager and may, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, request instructions from the Administrative Agent, and shall be entitled at all times to
refrain from taking any action unless it has received instructions from the Collateral Manager or the Administrative Agent, as applicable. The Custodian shall in all events have no liability, risk or cost for any action taken pursuant to and in
compliance with the instruction of the Administrative Agent.  (c) General Standards of Care. Notwithstanding any terms herein
contained to the contrary, the acceptance by the Custodian of its appointment hereunder is expressly subject to the following terms, which shall govern and apply to each of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (whether or not so stated
therein):  (i) The Custodian may rely on and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any written
notice, instruction, statement, certificate, request, waiver, consent, opinion, report, receipt or other paper or document furnished to it (including any of the foregoing provided to it by telecopier or electronic means), not only as to its due
execution and validity, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information therein contained, which it in good faith believes to be genuine and signed or presented by the proper person (which in the case of any instruction from or on behalf of
the Borrower shall be an Authorized Person); and the Custodian shall be entitled to presume the genuineness and due authority of any signature appearing thereon. The Custodian shall not be bound to 
  -168- 





make any independent investigation into the facts or matters stated in any such notice, instruction, statement, certificate, request, waiver, consent, opinion, report, receipt or other paper or
document; provided that if the form thereof is specifically prescribed by the terms of this Agreement, the Custodian shall examine the same to determine whether it substantially conforms on its face to such requirements hereof.

or for any act done or step taken or omitted to be taken by it (or any of its directors, officers of employees), or for any mistake of fact or Law, or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith, unless such action
constitutes gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct on its part and in breach of the terms of this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the Custodian shall not be liable for any action taken by it in good faith and reasonably believed by it to
be within powers conferred upon it, or taken by it pursuant to any direction or instruction by which it is governed hereunder, or omitted to be taken by it by reason of the lack of direction or instruction required hereby for such action. 
(iii) In no event shall the Custodian be liable for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages (including lost
profits) whether or not it has been advised of the likelihood of such damages.  (iv) The Custodian may consult with, and
obtain advice from, legal counsel selected in good faith with respect to any question as to any of the provisions hereof or its duties hereunder, or any matter relating hereto, and the written opinion or advice of such counsel shall be full and
complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by the Custodian in good faith in accordance with the opinion and directions of such counsel; the reasonable cost of such services shall be reimbursed pursuant

notice of any fact, claim or demand with respect hereto unless actually known by a Responsible Officer of the Custodian or unless (and then only to the extent) received in writing by a Responsible Officer of the Custodian and specifically
referencing this Agreement.  (vi) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Custodian to expend or risk its own
funds, or to take any action (or forbear from action) hereunder which might in its judgment involve any expense or any financial or other liability unless it shall be furnished with acceptable indemnification. Nothing herein shall obligate the
Custodian to commence, prosecute or defend legal proceedings in any instance, whether on behalf of the Borrower or on its own behalf or otherwise, with respect to any matter arising hereunder, or relating to this Agreement or the services
contemplated hereby.  (vii) The permissive right of the Custodian to take any action hereunder shall not be construed as a
duty.  (viii) The Custodian may act or exercise its duties or powers hereunder through agents or attorneys, and the

and the resignation or removal of the Custodian.  (xi) Each of the protections, reliances, indemnities and immunities
offered to the Collateral Agent in Article XI shall be afforded to the Custodian.  (xii) The
Custodian shall not be responsible for the accuracy or content of any certificate, statement, direction or opinion furnished to it in connection with this Agreement or any other Facility Document or Related Document. The Custodian shall not be bound
to make any investigation into the facts stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, consent, order, approval, bond or other document or have any responsibility for filing or recording any financing or continuation

Person for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties regarding the Borrower or the Collateral or in any document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or therewith or for the execution,
effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection, collectability, priority or sufficiency of thereof or any such other document or the financial condition of any Person or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions related to any Person or the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default. The Custodian shall not have any obligation whatsoever to any Person to assure
that any collateral exists or is owned by any Person or is cared for, protected or insured or that any liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to
exercise or to continue exercising at all or in any manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or available with respect thereto.

(i) directing the acquisition, sale or substitution of Collateral in accordance with Article X;

Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Agent the reports required to be delivered by the Collateral Manager under this Agreement; and 
(xi) directing the Collateral Agent to convert amounts denominated in any Eligible Currency to any other Eligible Currency for

enforcement of rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral Loans and the underlying assets securing such Collateral Loans under the Related Documents as have been transferred to the Borrower with respect to the related Collateral Loan, and
therefore, for all purposes under this Agreement, the Collateral Manager shall perform its administrative and management duties hereunder only to the extent that, as a lender under the Related Documents, the Borrower has the right to do so. 
(b) The Administrative Agent, each Lender, the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties shall not have any obligation or liability with
respect to any Collateral, nor shall any of them be obligated to perform any of the obligations of the Collateral Manager hereunder.  (c)
The Collateral Manager shall not be responsible or liable for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, epidemics, governmental regulations imposed after the fact, fire, communication line
failures, computer viruses, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters.  Section 14.03 Authorization of the Collateral
Manager  The Borrower hereby authorizes the Collateral Manager to take any and all reasonable steps in its name and on its behalf
necessary or desirable in the determination of the Collateral Manager and not inconsistent with the pledge of the Collateral by the Borrower to the Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties hereunder, to collect all amounts due under any
and all Collateral, including endorsing its name on checks and other instruments representing Collections, executing and delivering any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and all other
comparable instruments, with respect to the Collateral and, after the delinquency of any Collateral and to the extent permitted under and in compliance with Applicable Law, to commence proceedings with respect to enforcing payment thereof, to the
same extent as the Collateral Manager could have done if it owned such Collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Collateral Manager as its true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution) in its name, place and stead and at its expense, to sign, execute, certify, swear to, acknowledge, deliver, file, receive and record any and all documents
which the Collateral Manager reasonably deems appropriate or necessary in connection with the performance of its duties provided for herein. The Borrower shall furnish the Collateral Manager (and any successors thereto) with any powers of attorney
and other documents necessary or appropriate to enable the Collateral Manager to carry out its collateral management duties hereunder, and shall cooperate with the Collateral Manager to the fullest extent

  -174- 





in order to ensure the collectability of the Collateral. In no event shall the Collateral Manager be entitled to make the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other
Secured Party a party to any litigation without such partys express prior written consent, or to make the Borrower a party to any litigation (other than any foreclosure or similar collection procedure) without the Administrative Agents
consent. Following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (unless otherwise waived by the Lenders in accordance with Section 12.01), the Administrative Agent (acting in its sole discretion or at
the direction of the Required Lenders) may provide notice to the Collateral Manager (with a copy to the Collateral Agent) that the Secured Parties are exercising their control rights with respect to the Collateral in accordance with
Section 6.02(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral Manager shall act solely on behalf of the Borrower as an independent contractor for the sole purpose of providing the services described herein. 
Section 14.04 Separateness Provisions of the Borrower 
The Collateral Manager shall not in any way interfere with or frustrate the Borrowers compliance with the provisions of
Section 5.05 of this Agreement.  Section 14.05 Compensation 
As compensation for its administrative and management activities hereunder, the Collateral Manager or its designee shall be entitled to receive
the Collateral Management Fee pursuant to the Priority of Payments, and the Collateral Manager hereby directs the Collateral Management Fee be paid to the Equityholder and such payment to the Equityholder shall satisfy the obligation to pay the
Collateral Management Fee pursuant to the Priority of Payments.  The Collateral Manager may, in its sole discretion, elect to defer or
waive payment of any or all of any Collateral Management Fee otherwise due on any Payment Date by notice to the Borrower, the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Agent no later than the Determination Date immediately prior to such Payment
Date.  If and to the extent that there are insufficient funds to pay any Collateral Management Fee in full on any Payment Date or if any
Collateral Management Fee has accrued but is not yet due and payable, the amount due or accrued and unpaid will be deferred and will be payable on such later Payment Date on which funds are available in accordance with the Priority of Payments. 
Section 14.06 Expenses; Indemnification 
(a) The Collateral Manager shall be responsible for its expenses incurred by it in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement to
the extent not otherwise reimbursed by the Borrower.  (b) The Collateral Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified
Party from and against any and all Liabilities that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with any (i) acts or omissions of the Collateral Manager constituting bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Collateral Manager in connection with this Agreement, any other 
  -175- 





Facility Document, any Related Document or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby (and regardless of whether or not any such transactions are consummated), (ii) breach of any
representation or warranty under this Agreement, any other Facility Document or any Related Document by the Collateral Manager or (iii) failure by the Collateral Manager to comply with any term, provision or covenant contained in this
Agreement, any other Facility Document or any Related Document; except to the extent (i) any such Liability is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party, any of its Affiliates or the respective officers, directors, employees, agents, managers of, and any Person controlling any of, the foregoing,
(ii) resulting from the performance of the Collateral Loans (including without limitation any change in the market value of such Collateral Loan) or (iii) any loss in value of any Eligible Investment. In the case of an investigation,
litigation or proceeding to which the indemnity in this paragraph applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Collateral Manager, any of the Collateral Managers
equityholders or creditors, an Indemnified Party or any other Person, whether or not an Indemnified Party is otherwise a party hereto. The Collateral Manager shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any
settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party (or, in the case of a threatened proceeding, could reasonably have been expected to be a party if such proceeding had been brought) and indemnity
could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement (i) does not include a statement as to or admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any such Indemnified Party, or
(ii) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. This Section 14.06(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any
Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim. 
Section 14.07 The Collateral Manager Not to Resign; Assignment 
(a) The Collateral Manager shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed on it without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent.  (b) The Collateral Manager may not assign its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.  Section 14.08 Appointment of Successor Collateral Manager 
(a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Collateral Manager Default, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but
subject to Section 6.04(e), the Administrative Agent (as directed by the Required Lenders), with notice to the Borrower, the Equityholder, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders, may terminate all of the rights and
obligations of the Collateral Manager as Collateral Manager under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent with notice to the Borrower, the Equityholder, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders, may appoint a successor Collateral Manager
(the Successor Collateral Manager), which, for the avoidance of doubt may be the Administrative Agent or any Lender, and such Successor Collateral Manager shall accept its appointment by a written assumption in a form acceptable
to the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion. Until a successor Collateral Manager is appointed as set forth above, the Collateral Manager shall (i) unless otherwise notified by the Administrative

  -176- 





Agent, continue to act in such capacity in accordance with Section 14.02 and (ii) as requested by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion (A) terminate
some or all of its activities as Collateral Manager hereunder by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion as necessary or desirable, (B) provide such information as may be requested by the Administrative Agent to facilitate the
transition of the performance of such activities to the Administrative Agent or any agent thereof and (C) take all other actions requested by the Administrative Agent, in each case to facilitate the transition of the performance of such
activities to the Administrative Agent or any agent thereof.  (b) Upon its appointment, the Successor Collateral Manager shall be the
successor in all respects to the Collateral Manager with respect to collateral management functions under this Agreement and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto placed on the Collateral Manager by
the terms and provisions hereof, and all references in this Agreement to the Collateral Manager shall be deemed to refer to the Successor Collateral Manager; provided that the Successor Collateral Manager shall have (i) no liability with
respect to any action performed by the terminated Collateral Manager prior to the date that the Successor Collateral Manager becomes the successor to the Collateral Manager or any claim of a third party based on any alleged action or inaction of the
terminated Collateral Manager, (ii) no obligation to pay any taxes required to be paid by the Collateral Manager; provided that the Successor Collateral Manager shall pay any income taxes for which it is liable, (iii) no obligation
to pay any of the fees and expenses of any other party to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) no liability or obligation with respect to any Collateral Manager indemnification obligations of any prior Collateral Manager, including
the original Collateral Manager.  (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, a Successor Collateral Manager
is authorized to accept and rely on all of the accounting, records (including computer records) and work of the prior Collateral Manager relating to the Collateral Loans (collectively, the Predecessor Collateral Manager Work
Product) without any audit or other examination thereof, and such Successor Collateral Manager shall have no duty, responsibility, obligation or liability for the acts and omissions of the prior Collateral Manager. If any error,
inaccuracy, omission or incorrect or non-standard practice or procedure (collectively, Errors) exist in any Predecessor Collateral Manager Work Product and such Errors make it materially
more difficult to service or should cause or materially contribute to the Successor Collateral Manager making or continuing any Errors (collectively, Continued Errors), such Successor Collateral Manager shall have no duty,
responsibility, obligation or liability for such Continued Errors; provided that such Successor Collateral Manager agrees to use its best efforts to prevent further Continued Errors. In the event that the Successor Collateral Manager becomes
aware of Errors or Continued Errors, it shall, with the prior consent of the Administrative Agent, use its best efforts to reconstruct and reconcile such data as is commercially reasonable to correct such Errors and Continued Errors and to prevent
future Continued Errors.

ARTICLE XV 
THE COLLATERAL ADMINISTRATOR 
Section 15.01 Designation of Collateral Administrator 
(a) Initial Collateral Administrator. Until a successor Collateral Administrator is appointed in accordance with this
Article XV, WTNA is hereby appointed as, and hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to perform the duties and obligations of Collateral Administrator pursuant to the terms hereof and of the other Facility Documents to
which the Collateral Administrator is a party.  (b) Successor Collateral Administrator. Upon the Collateral Administrators
receipt of written notice from the Administrative Agent of the designation of a successor Collateral Administrator pursuant to the provisions of Section 15.05, the Collateral Administrator agrees that it will terminate its
activities as Collateral Administrator hereunder. Notwithstanding such termination, the Collateral Administrator shall be entitled to receive all accrued and unpaid Collateral Administration and Agency Fees and Administrative Expenses due and owing
to it at the time of such termination.  Section 15.02 Certain Duties and Powers 
(a) The Collateral Administrator shall assist the Borrower and the Collateral Manager in connection with monitoring the Collateral by
maintaining a database on certain characteristics of the Collateral on an ongoing basis and providing to the Borrower and the Collateral Manager (and, where applicable, the Borrowers independent public accountants) certain reports, schedules,
calculations all as more particularly described in this Section 15.02 below (in each case, such reports, schedules and calculations shall be prepared in such form and content, and in such greater detail, as may be mutually
agreed upon by the parties hereto from time to time and as may be required by the Agreement) based upon information and data received from the Borrower and/or the Collateral Manager, as required to be prepared and delivered (or which are necessary
to be prepared and delivered in order that certain other reports, schedules and calculations can be prepared and delivered) under Article VIII of this Agreement. The Collateral Administrators duties and authority to
act as Collateral Administrator hereunder are limited to the duties and authority specifically provided for in this Agreement. The Collateral Administrator shall not be deemed to assume the obligations of the Borrower or the Collateral Manager
hereunder or any other Facility Document, and nothing herein contained shall be deemed to release, terminate, discharge, limit, reduce, diminish, modify, amend or otherwise alter in any respect the duties, obligations or Liabilities of the Borrower
or the Collateral Manager under or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Facility Document. Without limiting the foregoing, the Collateral Administrator shall perform the following functions: 
(i) create a collateral database of certain characteristics (to the extent required for the performance of its obligations
hereunder, and otherwise as reasonably agreed to between the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager) of the Collateral Loans and Eligible Investments credited from time to time to the Covered Accounts (the Collateral
Database); within five (5) Business Days of the Closing Date;  (ii) permit access to the information in the
Collateral database by the Collateral Manager and the Borrower; 
  -178- 




(iii) update the Collateral Database promptly for ratings changes and for
Collateral Loans, Equity Securities and Eligible Investments acquired or sold or otherwise disposed of and for any amendments or changes to Collateral Loan amounts or interest rates and, if direct online viewing access to the foregoing is
unavailable, report any updates as of the close of business on the preceding Business Day to the Collateral database to the Administrative Agent no later than 5:00 p.m. on each Business Day, in each case based upon, and to the extent of, information
furnished to the Collateral Administrator by or on behalf of the Borrower or the Collateral Manager as may be reasonably required by the Collateral Administrator, or by the agents for the obligors from time to time; 
(iv) track the receipt and daily allocation of cash to the Collection Account and any withdrawals therefrom (including the
applicable Interest Rates provided to the Collateral Administrator by the Administrative Agent) and, if direct online viewing access to the foregoing is unavailable, report the balances of the Collection Account to the Administrative Agent no later
than 5:00 p.m. on each Business Day as of the close of business on the preceding Business Day;  (v) prepare and make
available to the parties required under this Agreement each of the Monthly Reports which are required to be provided pursuant to Section 8.09(a) of this Agreement by the time specified in this agreement and on the basis of
the information contained in the Collateral Database or as provided to the Collateral Administrator by the Borrower, Collateral Manager or Administrative Agent; and 
(vi) provide the Collateral Manager with such other information as may be reasonably requested in writing by the Collateral
Manager and as is within the possession of the Collateral Administrator.  (b) No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to relieve
the Collateral Administrator from liability for its own grossly negligent action, its own grossly negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct or fraud, except that: 
(i) this subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of subsection (a) of this
Section 15.02;  (ii) the Collateral Administrator shall not be liable for any error of judgment
made in good faith by a Responsible Officer of the Collateral Administrator, unless it shall be proven that the Collateral Administrator was grossly negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct; 
(iii) no provision of this Agreement shall require the Collateral Administrator to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise
incur any financial or other liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers contemplated hereunder, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or
indemnity satisfactory to it against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it unless such risk or liability relates to the performance of its ordinary services under this Agreement; and 
(iv) in no event shall the Collateral Administrator be liable for special, punitive, indirect or consequential loss or damage
of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits) even if the Collateral Administrator has been advised of the likelihood of such damages and regardless of the form of such action. 
  -179- 




(c) Upon request of the Collateral Administrator, the Borrower and the Collateral Manager
shall cooperate with the Collateral Administrator in connection with the matters described herein, including calculations and information relating to the Monthly Reports or as otherwise reasonably requested hereunder. Nothing herein shall obligate
the Collateral Administrator to determine independently the correct characterization or categorization of any item of Collateral under this Agreement (it being understood that any such characterization or categorization shall be based exclusively
upon the determination and notification received by the Collateral Administrator from the Collateral Manager). To the extent the Collateral Manager becomes actually aware that the information with respect to any Collateral Loan in any report,
instruction or certificate required to be delivered by the Collateral Administrator conflicts with information, data or calculations in the records of the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager shall notify the Collateral Administrator of such
discrepancy and use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Collateral Administrator in reconciling such discrepancy. The Collateral Administrator shall cooperate with the Collateral Manager in connection with the Collateral Managers
review of the contents of the aforesaid reports, instruction and certificates and will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such items to the Collateral Manager within a reasonably sufficient time (as agreed between the Collateral Manager
and the Collateral Administrator) prior to any applicable due date to enable such review.  (d) The Collateral Administrator shall have no
obligation to determine the Asset Value or the price of any Collateral in connection with any actions or duties under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall prevent the Collateral Administrator or any of its Affiliates from engaging in other
businesses or from rendering services of any kind to any Person.  (e) The Collateral Administrator shall in no event have any liability for
the actions or omissions of the Borrower, the Collateral Manager, the Administrative Agent, the Custodian (but only if not the same Person as the Collateral Administrator) or any other Person, and shall have no liability for any inaccuracy or error
in any duty performed by it that results from or is caused by inaccurate, untimely or incomplete information or data received by it from the Borrower, the Collateral Manager, the Custodian (but only if not the same Person as the Collateral
Administrator) or another Person except to the extent that such inaccuracies or errors are caused by the Collateral Administrators own willful misconduct, gross negligence or fraud. The Collateral Administrator shall not be liable for failing
to perform or any delay in performing its specified duties hereunder which results from or is caused by a failure or delay on the part of the Borrower, the Collateral Manager, the Administrative Agent, the Custodian (but only if not the same Person
as the Collateral Administrator) or any other Person in furnishing necessary, timely and accurate information to the Collateral Administrator. 
(f) It is expressly acknowledged by the Borrower and the Collateral Manager that application and performance by the Collateral Administrator of
its various duties hereunder (including recalculations to be performed in respect of the matters contemplated hereby) shall be based upon, and in reliance upon, data and information provided to it by the Collateral Manager (and/or the Borrower) with
respect to the Collateral, and the Collateral Administrator shall have no responsibility for the accuracy of any such information or data provided to it by such Persons. 
  -180- 





Nothing herein shall impose or imply any duty or obligation on the part of the Collateral Administrator to verify, investigate or audit any such information or data, or to determine or monitor on
an independent basis whether any obligor under the Collateral is in default or in compliance with the underlying documents governing or securing such securities, from time to time, the role of the Collateral Administrator hereunder being solely to
perform certain mathematical computations and data comparisons and to provide certain reports and other deliveries, as provided herein. For purposes of monitoring changes in ratings, the Collateral Administrator shall be entitled to use and rely (in
good faith) exclusively upon one or more reputable electronic financial information reporting services, and shall have no liability for any inaccuracies in the information reported by, or other errors or omissions of, any such services. 
(g) Nothing herein shall obligate the Collateral Administrator to determine independently any characteristic of a Collateral Loan, or to
evaluate or verify the Collateral Managers characterization of any Collateral Loan, including whether any item of Collateral is a Revolving Collateral Loan, Delayed Drawdown Collateral Loan, Fixed Rate Obligation, Noteless Loan, PIK Loan, DIP
Loan, Eligible Collateral Loan, Ineligible Collateral Loan, Equity Security, Middle Market Loan, Floor Obligation, Broadly Syndicated Loan, Second Lien Loan, Structured Finance Obligation, Certificated Security, Covenant Lite Loan or Uncertificated
Security, any such determination being based exclusively upon notification the Collateral Administrator receives from the Collateral Manager or from (or in its capacity as) the Collateral Agent (based upon notices received by the Collateral Agent
from the obligor, trustee or agent bank under an underlying governing document, or similar source) and nothing herein shall obligate the Collateral Administrator to review or examine any underlying instrument or contract evidencing, governing or
guaranteeing or securing any Collateral Loan in order to verify, confirm, audit or otherwise determine any characteristic thereof. 
Section 15.03 Certain Rights of Collateral Administrator 
Notwithstanding any terms herein contained to the contrary, the acceptance by the Collateral Administrator of its appointment hereunder is
expressly subject to the following terms, which shall govern and apply to each of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (whether or not so stated therein): 
(a) The Collateral Administrator may conclusively rely on and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution,
certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, note or other paper or document reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. 
(b) If, in performing its duties under this Agreement, the Collateral Administrator is required to decide between alternative courses of
action, the Collateral Administrator may request written instructions from the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Borrower as to the appropriate course of action desired by it. If the Collateral Administrator does not receive such
instructions within two (2) Business Days after it has requested them, the Collateral Administrator may, but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking any such courses of action; provided that the Collateral Administrator
shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, notify the Collateral Manager of which course of action, if any, it has decided to take. The Collateral Administrator shall act in accordance with instructions received after such two-Business Day period except to the extent it has already taken, or committed itself to take, action inconsistent with such instructions. 
  -181- 




(c) Neither the Collateral Administrator nor any of its directors, officers or employees
shall be liable to anyone for any error of judgment, or for any act done or step taken or omitted to be taken by it (or any of its directors, officers of employees), or for any mistake of fact or Law, or for anything which it may do or refrain from
doing in connection herewith, unless such action constitutes gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct on its part and in breach of the terms of this Agreement. The Collateral Administrator shall not be liable for any action taken by it in good
faith and reasonably believed by it to be within powers conferred upon it, or taken by it pursuant to any direction or instruction by which it is governed hereunder, or omitted to be taken by it by reason of the lack of direction or instruction
required hereby for such action.  (d) The Collateral Administrator may consult with, and obtain advice from, legal counsel selected in good
faith with respect to any question as to any of the provisions hereof or its duties hereunder, or any matter relating hereto, and the written opinion or advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any
action taken, suffered or omitted by the Collateral Administrator in good faith in accordance with the opinion and directions of such counsel, the reasonable cost of such services shall be reimbursed pursuant to
Section 15.04 below.  (e) The Collateral Administrator shall not be deemed to have notice of any fact, claim or
demand with respect hereto unless actually known by a Responsible Officer of the Collateral Administrator or unless (and then only to the extent) received in writing by the Collateral Administrator and specifically referencing this Agreement. 
(f) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Collateral Administrator to expend or risk its own funds, or to take any action (or
forbear from action) hereunder which might in its judgment involve any expense or any financial or other liability unless it shall be furnished with acceptable indemnification. Nothing herein shall obligate the Collateral Administrator to commence,
prosecute or defend legal proceedings in any instance, whether on behalf of the Borrower or on its own behalf or otherwise, with respect to any matter arising hereunder, or relating to this Agreement or the services contemplated hereby. 
(g) The permissive right of the Collateral Administrator to take any action hereunder shall not be construed as a duty. 
(h) The Collateral Administrator may act or exercise its duties or powers hereunder through agents or attorneys, and the Collateral
Administrator shall not be liable or responsible for the actions or omissions of any such agent or attorney selected by it with reasonable care. 
(i) The Collateral Administrator shall not be responsible or liable for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts beyond its
control; provided that the Collateral Administrator takes commercially reasonable efforts to resume performance after the cessation of such acts. Such acts shall include acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, epidemics,
governmental regulations imposed after the fact, fire, communication line failures, computer viruses, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters. 
  -182- 




(j) All indemnifications contained in this Agreement in favor of the Collateral
Administrator shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  (k) Each of the protections, reliances, indemnities and immunities offered
to the Collateral Agent in Article XI shall be afforded to the Collateral Administrator.  (l) The Collateral Administrator shall not
be responsible for the accuracy or content of any certificate, statement, direction or opinion furnished to it in connection with this Agreement or any other Facility Document or Related Document. The Collateral Administrator shall not be bound to
make any investigation into the facts stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, consent, order, approval, bond or other document or have any responsibility for filing or recording any financing or continuation
statement in any public office at any time or to otherwise perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interest or lien granted by any Person under any Facility Document or Related Document. The Collateral Administrator shall not be
responsible to any Person for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties regarding the Borrower or the Collateral or in any document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or therewith or for the
execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection, collectability, priority or sufficiency of thereof or any such other document or the financial condition of any Person or be required to make any inquiry concerning either
the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions related to any Person or the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default. The Collateral Administrator shall not have any obligation whatsoever to any
Person to assure that any collateral exists or is owned by any Person or is cared for, protected or insured or that any liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular
priority, or to exercise or to continue exercising at all or in any manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or available with respect thereto.

with the preparation or execution of this Agreement, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or the administration of this Agreement or performance by the Collateral Administrator of its duties and services under this Agreement

Borrower, the Lenders and the Collateral Manager.  (d) The Collateral Administrator may be removed at any time by the Collateral Manager
upon thirty (30) days notice (with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent).  (e) If the Collateral Administrator
shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of the Collateral Administrator for any reason (other than resignation), the Borrower shall, promptly after becoming aware of such resignation,
removal, incapacity or vacancy, appoint a successor collateral administrator by written instrument, executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, one copy of which shall be delivered to the retiring Collateral Administrator and one copy to the
successor Collateral Administrator, together with a copy to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders; provided that such successor Collateral Administrator shall be appointed only upon the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and, so long as no Collateral Manager Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Manager (in each case which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). In the case of a resignation by the Collateral Administrator, if no successor Collateral Administrator shall have been appointed and an instrument of acceptance by a successor Collateral Administrator shall not have been delivered to
the resigning Collateral Administrator and the Administrative Agent within thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the Administrative Agent may appoint a successor Collateral Administrator or the resigning Collateral
Administrator may petition any court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Borrower to appoint a successor Collateral Administrator.

Section 15.06 Acceptance and Appointment by Successor 
Each successor Collateral Administrator appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Borrower, the Collateral Manager, the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the retiring Collateral Administrator an instrument accepting such appointment. Upon delivery of the required instruments, the resignation or removal of the retiring Collateral Administrator shall become
effective and such successor Collateral Administrator, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts, duties and obligations of the retiring Collateral Administrator; but, on request of the
Borrower, the Collateral Manager, the Administrative Agent or the successor Collateral Administrator, such retiring Collateral Administrator shall (i) execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Collateral Administrator all
the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Collateral Administrator and (ii) execute and deliver such further documents and instruments and take such further action as may be reasonably requested in order to effect the transfer of the
rights, powers, duties and obligations of the Collateral Administrator hereunder. Upon request of any such successor Collateral Administrator, the Borrower shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming
to such successor Collateral Administrator all such rights, powers and trusts.  Section 15.07 Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or
Succession to Business of Collateral Administrator  Any organization or entity into which the Collateral Administrator may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any organization or entity resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Collateral Administrator shall be a party, or any organization or entity succeeding to all or
substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Collateral Administrator, shall be the successor of the Collateral Administrator hereunder, without the execution or filing of any document or any further act on the part of any of the parties
hereto.  Section 15.08 Certain Duties of Collateral Administrator Related to Delayed Payment of Proceeds 
In the event that in any month the Collateral Administrator shall not have received any payment (or is unable to identify whether any payment
consists of Principal Proceeds or Interest Proceeds) with respect to any Collateral Loan pursuant to the applicable Related Documents, (a) the Collateral Administrator shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, and the
Collateral Manager and (b) unless within three (3) Business Days (or the end of the applicable grace period for such payment, if longer) after such notice such payment shall have been received by the Custodian (or such Collections shall
have been identified), the Collateral Manager shall request the applicable Obligor or designated paying agent, as applicable, to make such payment (or identify such Collections) as soon as practicable after such request but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days after the date of such request. In the event that such payment is not made (or such Collections are not identified) within such time period, the Collateral Administrator, subject to the provisions of this
Article XV, shall take such reasonable action at the Borrowers expense as the Collateral Manager shall direct. Any such action shall be without prejudice to any right to claim a Default or Event of Default under this
Agreement. All Collections that the Collateral Administrator is unable to identify as Principal Proceeds or Interest Proceeds shall be held in the Collection Account.
