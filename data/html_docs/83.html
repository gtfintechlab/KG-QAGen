with and at the time required by <u>Section 2.02</u>) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Revolving Credit Lender has not in fact made its share of the
applicable Revolving Credit Loan Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Revolving Credit Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">5. <u>Certain Waivers</u>. Each Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any Borrower or
any other Guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Guaranteed Party) of the liability of any Borrower other than indefeasible payment and performance in full of the Guaranteed Obligations,
(b) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantors obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of any Borrower, (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantors liability hereunder,
(d) any right to proceed, or to require any Guaranteed Party to proceed against any Borrower, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the power of any Guaranteed Party whatsoever,

protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or

California Civil Code. As provided below, this Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The foregoing waivers and the provisions hereinafter set forth in this Guaranty which pertain to
California law are included solely out of an abundance of caution, and shall not be construed to mean that any of the above-referenced provisions of California law are in any way applicable to this Guaranty or the Guaranteed Obligations. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">6. <u>Obligations Independent</u>. The respective obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are
those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations and the obligations of any other Guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against each Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not any
Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">7. <u>Subrogation</u>. Each Guarantor shall not exercise any right of
subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and
performed in full and the Commitments and the Facilities are terminated. If any amounts are paid to any Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and shall
forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of itself and the other Guaranteed Parties) to reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">8. <u>Contribution</u>. Subject to <u>Section 7</u>, each Guarantor hereby agrees with each other Guarantor that if any Guarantor shall
make an Excess Payment, such Guarantor shall have a right of contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantors Contribution Share of such Excess Payment. The payment obligations of any Guarantor under this
Section shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the Guaranteed Obligations until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full, and no Guarantor shall exercise any right or remedy under
this Section against any other Guarantor until such Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full. Each Guarantor recognizes and acknowledges that the rights to contribution arising hereunder shall constitute an asset in
favor of the party entitled to such contribution. This Section shall not be deemed to affect any right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution that any Guarantor may have under applicable Law against any Borrower in respect of any
payment of Guaranteed Obligations. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">9. <u>Termination; Reinstatement</u>. This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all
Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Loan Document Obligations (other than any contingent indemnification or similar contingent obligation not yet due and payable) and any other amounts
payable under this Guaranty (other than any contingent indemnification or similar contingent obligation not yet due and payable) are indefeasibly paid in full in cash and the Commitments and the Facilities with respect to the Loan Document
Obligations are terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of a Borrower or any Guarantor is made, or any Guaranteed Party
exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Loan Document Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including
pursuant to any settlement entered into by any Guaranteed Party in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not
been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not any Guaranteed Party is in possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The obligations of each Guarantor under
this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty. </p>

indebtedness of any Borrower owing to such Guarantor, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of a Borrower to such Guarantor as subrogee of any Guaranteed Party or resulting from such Guarantors
performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations; <u>provided</u> that a Borrower may make ordinary course payments pursuant to such Borrowers and its Subsidiaries cash management
system unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. If the Administrative Agent so requests when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any such obligation or indebtedness of any Borrower to any Guarantor shall be
enforced, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">11. <u>Stay of

relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrowers or any other guarantor (the guarantor waiving any duty on the part of any Guaranteed Parties to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide
the same). </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">13. <u>Keepwell</u>. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor party hereto jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and

regulations thereunder to honor all of its obligations under this Guaranty in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 13 for the maximum amount of such liability
that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 13 or otherwise under this Guaranty voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The
obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 13 shall remain in full force and effect until the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this
Section 13 constitute, and this Section 13 shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of each Loan Party for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange
Act. </p>
