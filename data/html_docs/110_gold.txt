Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of 15 Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding.(d)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert to or continue, any Eurodollar Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date.SECTION 2.03.    Requests for Borrowings.  To request a Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone, fax or electronic mail (in .pdf or .tif format) (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the Funding Date or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Funding Date.  Each such Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and, in the case of a telephonic Borrowing Request, shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery, fax or electronic mail (in .pdf or .tif format) to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request signed by the Borrower.  Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:(i)    the aggregate principal amount of the requested Borrowing;(ii)    the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;(iii)    whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;30(iv)    in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”; and(v)    the location and number of the Borrower’s account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.06.If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing.  If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.  Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.SECTION 2.04.    [Reserved].SECTION 2.05.    [Reserved].SECTION 2.06.    Funding of Borrowings.(a)    Funding.  Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the Funding Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders.  The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly remitting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the Borrowing Request.(b)    Presumption by Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the Funding Date that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the Loans comprising such Borrowing.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall both pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.SECTION 2.07.    Interest Elections.(a)    Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in the Borrowing Request or as otherwise provided in Section 2.03.  Thereafter, the Borrower may, at any time and from 31time to time, elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.  (b)    To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone, fax or electronic mail by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.  Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery, fax or electronic mail to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request signed by the Borrower.  Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:(i)    the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);(ii)    the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;(iii)    whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and(iv)    if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.(c)    Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.(d)    If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default under clause (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing, or if any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, notifies the Borrower of the election to give effect to this sentence on account of such other Event of Default, then, in each such case, so long as such Event of Default is continuing, (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.SECTION 2.08.    Termination and Reduction of Commitments.32(a)    Unless previously terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Commitment of each Lender shall terminate on the earlier of (i) immediately after the making of the Loan by such Lender on the Funding Date and (ii) the Commitment Termination Date.(b)    The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; provided that each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less t

e by an amount equal to 100% of the committed amount under such Qualifying Term Facility (or if less, by an amount equal to the Aggregate Commitments then outstanding), with such reduction to be effective upon the later of (i) the effectiveness of the definitive credit or similar agreement for such term loan facility and (ii) such term loan facility becoming a Qualifying Term Facility.  (d)    In the event and on each occasion that, after the Closing Date and prior to the termination of all the Commitments, the Borrower or any Subsidiary actually receives Net Cash Proceeds in respect of a Reduction/Prepayment Event, the Commitments then outstanding shall automatically and permanently reduce by an amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds (or if less, by an amount equal to the Aggregate Commitments then outstanding), with such reduction to be effective on the date of the actual receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds by the Borrower or any Subsidiary.(e)    The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone, fax or electronic mail (and, in the case of telephonic notice, promptly confirmed by hand delivery, fax or electronic mail) of (i) any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction and (ii) any automatic reduction of the Commitments under paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section no later than the effective date of such reduction, in each case, specifying such election or reduction and the effective date thereof and, in the case of any such reduction, providing a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that any such notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section may state that such notice is conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent.  Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the applicable Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.SECTION 2.09.    Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.(a)    The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay, without premium or penalty (subject to Section 2.15), to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, the then unpaid principal amount of the Loan of such Lender on the Maturity Date.(b)    Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from the Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.33(c)    The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.(d)    The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.(e)    Any Lender may request that the Loan made by it be evidenced by a promissory note.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender substantially in the form of Exhibit D.  Thereafter, the Loan evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein.SECTION 2.10.    Prepayment of Loans.(a)    The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (subject to Section 2.15), subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.(b)    In the event and on each occasion that, after the making of the Loans on the Funding Date, the Borrower or any Subsidiary actually receives any Net Cash Proceeds in respect of a Reduction/Prepayment Event, then the Borrower shall, on or prior to the first Business Day after the actual receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, prepay Borrowings in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate principal amount of Loans then outstanding and (ii) 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds.(c)    The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone, fax or electronic mail (and, in the case of telephonic notice, promptly confirmed by hand delivery, fax or electronic mail) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the same Business Day as the date of prepayment; provided, in each case, if such prepayment is pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section, then such notice or prepayment shall not be due until such later time on the required date of such prepayment as shall be practicable.  Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that a notice of prepayment of any Borrowing under paragraph (a) of this Section may state that such notice is conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified date of prepayment) if such condition is not satisfied.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(e)    Indemnification by the Lenders.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(d) 38relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 2.16(g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authori

 that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place such indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This Section 2.16(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.(h)    Survival.  Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.16 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.(i)    Defined Terms.

The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.(b)    If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled 41thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.(c)    If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any Person that is an Eligible Assignee.  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.(d)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.(e)    If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.06(b), Section 2.16(e), Section 2.17(d) or Section 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent to satisfy such Lender’s obligations to the Administrative Agent under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.SECTION 2.18.    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.(a)    Designation of a Different Lending Office.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loan hereunder or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches 42or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment and delegation (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or Section 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasona

2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office, or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations, in accordance with Section 2.18(a), (ii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or (iii) any Lender refuses to consent to any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof that requires the unanimous approval of all Lenders, or the approval of each of the Lenders affected thereby (in each case in accordance with Section 9.02), and the consent of the Required Lenders shall have been obtained with respect to such amendment, modification, waiver or consent, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort (including payment of any applicable processing and recordation fees), upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payment pursuant to Section 2.14 or Section 2.16) and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (A) the Borrower shall have (x) paid to the Administrative Agent the processing and recordation fee (if any) specified in Section 9.04, and (y) received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (with respect to any assignee that is not already a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed, (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loan, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder (including any amounts under Section 2.15), from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (C) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment and delegation will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments, (D) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from the failure to provide a consent, the assignee shall have given such consent and, as a result of such assignment and delegation and any contemporaneous assignments, delegations and consents, the applicable amendment, modification, waiver or consent can be effected and (E) such assignment and delegation does not conflict with applicable law.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  Each party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto (it being understood and agreed that such Lender shall not be deemed to make the representations and warranties in such Assignment and Assumption if such Lender has not executed such Assignment and Assumption). SECTION 2.19.    Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its lending office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBO Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through 43the Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Loans or to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Loans of such Lender to ABR Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Alternate Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBO Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBO Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.SECTION 2.20.    Defaulting Lenders.  Notwithstanding any provision of any Loan Document to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:(a)    the Ticking Fee shall cease to accrue on the amount of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a); and(b)    the Commitment and Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders or any other requisite Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); provided that any amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or all Lenders affected thereby shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02, require the consent of such Defaulting Lender in accordance with the terms hereof.In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Borrower each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then on such date such Lender shall take such actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be appropriate in connection with such Lender ceasing to be a Defaulting Lender, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender.The rights and remedies against, and with respect to, a Defaulting Lender under this Section are in addition to, and cumulative and not in limitation of, all other rights and remedies that the Administrative Agent and each Lender, the Borrower or any other Loan Party may at any time have against, or with respect to, such Defaulting Lender.ARTICLE IIIRepresentations and WarrantiesThe Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that on the Funding Date:44SECTION 3.01.    Organization; Powers.

Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Person named as the Administrative Agent to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and of the other Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and, except for the approval rights of the Borrower set forth in Section 8.06, neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead, such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.SECTION 8.02.    Rights as a Lender.  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender, and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person 62serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.SECTION 8.03.    Exculpatory Provisions.  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:(a)    shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;(b)    shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally or otherwise or that may affect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally or otherwise; and(c)    shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to a Loan Party or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02 and Article VII) or (ii) unless a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined by a final, non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent was grossly negligent or acted with willful misconduct in taking or not taking any such action.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice (stating that it is a “notice of default”) describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by a Loan Party or a Lender.The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.63SECTION 8.04.    Reliance by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof).  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof), and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender sufficiently in advance prior to the making of such Loan.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Loan Parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.SECTION 8.05.    Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Facility as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.SECTION 8.06.    Resignation of Administrative Agent.(a)    The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor (which shall be a bank with an office in the United States of America, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States) approved by the Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), provided that no approval of the Borrower shall be necessary after the Funding Date if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Closing Date”), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, and, prior to the Funding Date, with the consent of the Borrower, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above.  Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Closing Date.(b)    If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and appoint a successor (which shall be a bank with an office in the United States of America, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States) approved by the Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that no approval of the Borrower shall be 64necessary if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.(c)    With effect from the Resignation Closing Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (ii) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint, with the approval of the Borrower to the extent provided above, a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above.  Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or removed) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 2.16(h) and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Closing Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section).  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring or removed Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.SECTION 8.07.    Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Arranger or any other Lender, or any of their Related Parties, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, or any of their Related Parties, and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.SECTION 8.08.    No Other Duties, Etc.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Joint Bookrunners, the Joint Lead Arrangers or the Syndication Agents listed on the cover page hereof shall have any duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.SECTION 8.09.    Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally or otherwise or any other judicial proceeding relating to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower or any other Loan Party) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:65(a)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Section 2.11 and Section 9.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and(b)    to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Section 2.11 and Section 9.03.Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.ARTICLE IXMiscellaneousSECTION 9.01.    Notices; Effectiveness; Communication.(a)    Notices Generally.

(i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loan at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent of:(A)    the Borrower (after the Funding Date, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to (x) an Existing Lender or (y) after the Funding Date if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; and(B)    the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);provided that, after the Funding Date, assignments of Loans to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund shall not be subject to the above consent requirements.(ii)    Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:(A)    except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning 71Lender’s Commitment or Loan, the amount of the Commitment or Loan of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that, after the Funding Date, no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;(B)    each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned;(C)    the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment;(D)    the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire;(E)    the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall be required to execute and deliver the applicable forms to the extent required under Section 2.16(f) for any Lender, and no assignment shall be effective in connection herewith unless and until such forms are so delivered; and(F)    the assignment shall be recorded in the Register as required under Section 9.04(c), and no assignment shall be effective in connection herewith unless and until such assignment is so recorded.If the consent of the Borrower is required pursuant to this Section 9.04(b) in connection with any assignment, then, after the Funding Date, the Borrower shall be deemed to have provided such consent unless it has notified the Administrative Agent of its refusal to give such consent within ten Business Days following the Borrower receiving a written request for such consent with respect to such assignment.(iii)    In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment or other compensating actions) to pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.(iv)    Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each 72Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.14, Section 2.15, Section 2.16 and Section 9.03).

The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.(e)    Pledge by Lender.

All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower and the other Loan Parties herein and in the other Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Arranger, any Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty on the Funding Date, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.  The provisions of Section 2.14, Section 2.15, Section 2.16 and Section 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.SECTION 9.06.    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.

The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or its Affiliates may have.  Each Lender agrees to promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.SECTION 9.09.    Subsidiary Guarantees.

So long as no Default has occurred and is continuing (or would result from such release), (a) if all of the Equity Interests of a Subsidiary Guarantor that are owned by the Borrower or any other Subsidiary are sold or otherwise disposed of in a transaction or transactions permitted by this Agreement and as a result of such disposition such Person is no longer a Subsidiary or (b) in the event that, immediately after giving effect to the release of any Subsidiary Guarantor’s Subsidiary Guaranty, all of the Indebtedness of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries is permitted under Section 6.01, then, in each case, promptly following the Borrower’s request, the Administrative Agent shall execute a release of such Subsidiary Guarantor from its Subsidiary Guaranty; provided, however, that clause (b) of this Section shall not authorize the release of a Subsidiary Guarantor from its Subsidiary Guaranty if at the time of the requested release it is required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Section 5.10(a).  A request by the Borrower for a release pursuant to this Section shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Responsible Officer certifying that the conditions to release set forth in this Section have been satisfied.
