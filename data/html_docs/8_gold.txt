following receipt by the Administrative Agent of written notice delivered by, or caused to be 



delivered by, the Borrower in accordance with Section 8.2.(n) that the Credit Rating has changed; provided, however, if the Borrower has not delivered, or has not caused to be delivered, the
notice required by such Section but the Administrative Agent becomes aware that the Credit Rating has changed, then the Administrative Agent shall give Borrower notice of its awareness of such change (provided that failure to give such notice shall
not limit the effectiveness of any adjustment of the applicable Level by the Administrative Agent in accordance with this definition) and may, in its sole discretion, adjust the Level effective as of the first day of the first calendar month

name provided by the Borrower to effect a wire of funds transfer even if the information provided by the Borrower identifies a different bank or account holder than named by the Borrower. The Administrative Agent is not obligated or required in any
way to take any actions to detect errors in information provided by the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent takes any actions in an attempt to detect errors in the transmission or content of transfer requests or takes any actions in an attempt to
detect unauthorized funds transfer requests, the Borrower agrees that no matter how many times the Administrative Agent takes these actions the Administrative Agent will not in any situation be liable for failing to take or correctly perform these
actions in the future and such actions shall not become any part of the transfer disbursement procedures authorized under this provision, the Loan Documents, or any agreement between the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. The Borrower agrees to
notify the Administrative Agent of any errors in the transfer of any funds or of any unauthorized or improperly authorized transfer requests within fourteen (14) days after the Administrative Agents confirmation to the Borrower of such
transfer.  (b)        Funds
Transfer.    The Administrative Agent will, in its sole discretion, determine the funds transfer system and the means by which each transfer will be made. The Administrative Agent may delay or refuse to accept a funds
transfer request if the transfer would: (i) violate the terms of this authorization, (ii) require use of a bank unacceptable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender or 
  - 21 - 



prohibited by any Governmental Authority, (iii) cause the Administrative Agent or any Lender to violate any Federal Reserve or other regulatory risk control program or guideline or
(iv) otherwise cause the Administrative Agent or any Lender to violate any Applicable Law or regulation. 
(c)        Limitation of Liability.   None of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender shall be liable to the Borrower or any other parties for (i) errors, acts or failures to act of others, including other entities, banks, communications carriers or clearinghouses, through which the
Borrowers transfers may be made or information received or transmitted, and no such entity shall be deemed an agent of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (ii) any loss, liability or delay caused by fires, earthquakes, wars, civil
disturbances, power surges or failures, acts of government, labor disputes, failures in communications networks, legal constraints or other events beyond Administrative Agents or any Lenders control, or (iii) any special,
consequential, indirect or punitive damages, whether or not (x) any claim for these damages is based on tort or contract or (y) the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower knew or should have known the likelihood of these damages
in any situation. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender makes any representations or warranties other than those expressly made in this Agreement.  ARTICLE III. PAYMENTS, FEES AND OTHER GENERAL PROVISIONS 
Section 3.1.  Payments.  (a)        Payments by Borrower.  Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all payments of principal, interest and other amounts to be made
by the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made in Dollars, in immediately available funds, without deduction, set-off or counterclaim, to the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office, not later than 11:00 a.m.
Pacific time on the date on which such payment shall become due (each such payment made after such time on such due date to be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day). Subject to Section 10.4., the Borrower shall, at the
time of making each payment under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, specify to the Administrative Agent the amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied. Each payment received by the Administrative Agent
for the account of a Lender under this Agreement or any Note of such Lender shall be paid to such Lender, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the wiring instructions provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent
from time to time, for the account of such Lender at the applicable Lending Office of such Lender. If the Administrative Agent fails to pay such amount to a Lender within one Business Day of receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent shall pay interest on such amount until paid at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. If the due date of any payment under this Agreement or any other Loan Document would otherwise fall on
a day which is not a Business Day such date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest shall be payable for the period of such extension. 
(b)        Presumptions Regarding Payments by
Borrower.   Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not
make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may (but shall not be obligated to), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.
In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent on demand that amount so distributed to such Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry
rules on interbank compensation. 
  - 22 - 


Section 3.2.  Pro Rata Treatment. 
Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a) the borrowing from the Lenders under Section 2.1.(a), shall
be made from the Lenders, and each payment of the fees under Section 3.6.(a) shall be made for the account of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (b) each payment or prepayment of principal of
Loans shall be made for the account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans held by them, provided that, subject to Section 3.10., if immediately prior to giving effect to any such payment
in respect of any Loans the outstanding principal amount of the Loans shall not be held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments in effect at the time such Loans were made, then such payment shall be applied to the
Loans in such manner as shall result, as nearly as is practicable, in the outstanding principal amount of the Loans being held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments; (c) each payment of interest on Loans shall
be made for the account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the respective Lenders; and (d) the Conversion and Continuation of Loans of a particular Type (other than
Conversions provided for by Section 4.5.) shall be made pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Loans and the then current Interest Period for each Lenders portion of each such Loan of such Type shall be
coterminous.  Section 3.3.  Sharing of Payments, Etc. 
If a Lender shall obtain payment of any principal of, or interest on, its Loan under this Agreement or shall obtain
payment on any other Obligation owing by the Borrower or any other Loan Party through the exercise of any right of set-off, bankers lien or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise or through voluntary prepayments directly to a Lender or
other payments made by the Borrower or any other Loan Party to a Lender not in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such payment should be distributed to the Lenders in accordance with Section 3.2. or Section 10.4., such Lender
shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by such Lender, direct interests in) the Loans made by the other Lenders or other Obligations owed to such other Lenders in such amounts, and make
such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Lenders shall share the benefit of such payment (net of any reasonable expenses which may actually be incurred by such Lender in obtaining or preserving such
benefit) in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.2. or Section 10.4., as applicable. To such end, all the Lenders shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such
payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation (or direct interest) in the Loans or other Obligations owed to such other Lenders may exercise all rights of set-off, bankers
lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of Loans in the amount of such participation. Nothing contained herein shall require any Lender to exercise any such right or
shall affect the right of any Lender to exercise and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of the Borrower.  Section 3.4.  Several Obligations.  No
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make a Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender hereunder, and the failure of any Lender to make a Loan or to perform any other obligation
to be made or performed by it hereunder shall not relieve the obligation of any other Lender to make any Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender. 
  - 23 - 


Section 3.5.  Minimum Amounts. 
(a)        Borrowings.    Each Continuation of, and
each Conversion of Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount. 
(b)        Prepayments.    Each voluntary prepayment
of Loans (other than a prepayment of all outstanding Loans) shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof.  Section 3.6.  Fees. 
(a)        Closing Fee.   On the Effective Date, the
Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders a closing fee in the amount of 0.25% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments. 
(b)        Administrative and Other Fees.   The Borrower
agrees to pay the administrative and other fees of the Administrative Agent as may be agreed to in writing from time to time. 
Section 3.7.  Computations.  Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, any accrued interest on any Loan, any Fees or any other Obligations due hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of
days elapsed.  Section 3.8.  Usury. 
In no event shall the amount of interest due or payable on the Loans or other Obligations exceed the maximum rate of
interest allowed by Applicable Law and, if any such payment is paid by the Borrower or any other Loan Party or received by any Lender, then such excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the Borrower shall notify the respective
Lender in writing that the Borrower elects to have such excess sum returned to it forthwith. It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the Borrower not pay and the Lenders not receive, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever,
interest in excess of that which may be lawfully paid by the Borrower under Applicable Law. The parties hereto hereby agree and stipulate that the only charge imposed upon the Borrower for the use of money in connection with this Agreement is and
shall be the interest specifically described in Section 2.2.(a)(i) and (ii). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto further agree and stipulate that all agency fees, syndication fees, underwriting fees, default charges, late charges,
funding or breakage charges, increased cost charges, attorneys fees and reimbursement for costs and expenses paid by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to third parties or for damages incurred by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, are charges made to compensate the Administrative Agent or any such Lender for underwriting or administrative services and costs or losses performed or incurred, and to be performed or incurred, by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in
connection with this Agreement and shall under no circumstances be deemed to be charges for the use of money. All charges other than charges for the use of money shall be fully earned and nonrefundable when due. 
Section 3.9.  Statements of Account; Bill Lead Date Request. 
(a)        The Administrative Agent will account to the Borrower monthly with a
statement of Loans, accrued interest and Fees, charges and payments made pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and such account rendered by the Administrative Agent shall be deemed conclusive

  - 24 - 



upon the Borrower absent manifest error. The failure of the Administrative Agent to deliver such a statement of accounts shall not relieve or discharge the Borrower from any of its Obligations.
 (b)        By written notice to the Administrative Agent, the
Borrower may request to receive monthly billings on a date (the Bill Lead Date) that is prior to the first day of a month. The Administrative Agent will submit to the Borrower monthly billings, which will consist of the actual interest
and principal due through the Bill Lead Date plus projected interest and principal due through the balance, if any, of such month. Any necessary adjustments in the applicable interest rate and/or principal payments due or made between a Bill
Lead Date and the end of a month will be reflected as an additional charge (or credit) in the billing for the next following month. Neither the failure of the Administrative Agent to submit a Bill Lead Date billing nor any error in any such billing
will excuse the Borrowers obligation to make full payment of all amounts due under this Agreement. In its sole discretion, the Administrative Agent may cancel or modify the terms of such request which cancellation or modification will be
effective upon written notification to the Borrower. Should the Borrower request a Bill Lead Date, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to prepare a month end invoice.  Section 3.10.  Defaulting Lenders. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then,
until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law: 
(a)        Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting
Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Requisite Lenders. 
(b)        Defaulting Lender Waterfall.  Any payment of
principal, interest, Fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article XI. or otherwise) or received by the Administrative
Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 12.4. shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the
Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting
Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; third, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and fourth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent
jurisdiction. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such
Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
(c)        Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth
therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held pro rata
by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Credit Percentages, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to Fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf
of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly 
  - 25 - 



agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having
been a Defaulting Lender.  Section 3.11.  Taxes. 
(a)        Taxes Generally.    All payments by the
Borrower of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and all other Obligations shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any present or future excise, stamp or other taxes, fees, duties, levies, imposts, charges, deductions,
withholdings or other charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority, but excluding (i) franchise taxes, (ii) any taxes (other than withholding taxes) that would not be imposed but for a connection between the
Administrative Agent or a Lender and the jurisdiction imposing such taxes (other than a connection arising solely by virtue of the activities of the Administrative Agent or such Lender pursuant to or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document), (iii) any taxes imposed on or measured by the Administrative Agents or any Lenders assets, net income, receipts or branch profits, (iv) any taxes to the extent that such tax would apply to the Administrative Agent or
any Lender immediately prior to the Agreement Date or, in the case of an Eligible Assignee that becomes a Lender pursuant to Section 12.6., as of the date such Person becomes a Lender, (v) any taxes arising after the Agreement Date solely
as a result of or attributable to a Lender changing its designated Lending Office after the date such Lender becomes a party hereto, and (vi) any taxes imposed by Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code (including any current or
future regulations or official interpretations thereof and any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, collectively, FATCA) on any withholdable payment payable to such
recipient as a result of the failure of such recipient to satisfy the applicable requirements as set forth in FATCA (such non-excluded items being collectively called Taxes). If any withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by
the Borrower hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any Applicable Law, then the Borrower will:  (i)         pay directly to the relevant Governmental Authority the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted; 
(ii)        promptly forward to the Administrative Agent an
official receipt, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent evidencing such payment to such Governmental Authority; and 
(iii)       pay to the Administrative Agent for its account or the
account of the applicable Lender such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Administrative Agent or such Lender will equal the full amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender
would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required. 
(b)        Tax Indemnification.   If the Borrower fails to
pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate Governmental Authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent, for its account or the account of the respective Lender, as the case may be, the required receipts or other required documentary
evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. For purposes of this
Section, a distribution hereunder by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to or for the account of any Lender shall be deemed a payment by the Borrower.  (c)        Tax Forms. 
  - 26 - 


(i)         Prior to the date that any Lender or Participant
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than that in which the Borrower is a resident for tax purposes becomes a party hereto, such Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent such certificates, documents or other
evidence, as required by the Internal Revenue Code or Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto (including Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8ECI and W-8BEN, as applicable, or appropriate successor forms or such other evidence satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower), properly completed, currently effective and duly executed by such Lender or Participant establishing that payments to it hereunder and under the Notes are (i) not subject to United States Federal
backup withholding tax and (ii) not subject to United States Federal withholding tax under the Internal Revenue Code. Each such Lender or Participant shall, to the extent it may lawfully do so, (x) deliver further copies of such forms or
other appropriate certifications on or before the date that any such forms expire or become obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form delivered to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and
(y) obtain such extensions of the time for filing, and renew such forms and certifications thereof, as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent. To the extent that amounts payable under the last sentence of
subsection (a) or pursuant to subsection (b) resulted from the failure of any Lender or Participant that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than that in which the Borrower is a resident for tax purposes or the
Administrative Agent, if it is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than that in which the Borrower is a resident for tax purposes, if such Lender, Participant or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to comply with the requirements
of this subsection, the Borrower shall not be required to pay such amounts. 
(ii)        The Administrative Agent each Lender and each
Participant that is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-9
establishing that payments to it hereunder and under the Notes are not subject to United States Federal backup withholding tax. If the Administrative Agent any Lender or any Participant required to deliver the completed forms described in the
immediately preceding sentence fails to deliver such forms, then the Borrower shall not be required to pay any amount pursuant to the last sentence of subsection (a) or pursuant to subsection (b) to the extent the amounts payable under
such sentence or subsection (a) or under subsection (b) resulted from such failure to deliver such forms.  (iii)       If any Lender or Participant, to the extent it may lawfully do so, fails to deliver the forms or other documentation described in the immediately preceding
subsections (c)(i) or (c)(ii), as applicable, then the Administrative Agent may withhold from such payment to such Lender such amounts as are required by the Internal Revenue Code, and such withheld amounts shall be deemed to have been paid to such
Lender. If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such Lender shall indemnify
the Administrative Agent therefor, including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses (including all reasonable fees and
disbursements of any law firm or other external counsel and the allocated cost of internal legal services and all disbursements of internal counsel) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the Lenders under this Section shall survive the
termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent.  (d)        Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid
any claimed exemption or reduction, 
  - 27 - 



and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its
Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of Applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent make any withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. 
(e)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Borrower shall not
be obligated to make payment to the Administrative Agent or any Lender (as the case may be) pursuant to this Section in respect of penalties, interest and other liabilities attributable to any Taxes, if (i) written demand therefor has not been
made by the Administrative Agent or such Lender within 60 days from the date on which the Administrative Agent or such Lender received written notice of the imposition of Taxes by the relevant taxing or Governmental Authority, but only to the extent
such penalties, interest and other similar liabilities are attributable to such failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in making such written demand, (ii) such penalties, interest and other liabilities have accrued after
the Borrower had indemnified or paid an additional amount due as of the date of such payment pursuant to this Section or (iii) such penalties, interest and other liabilities are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Administrative Agent or such Lender as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment.  (f)       If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified
pursuant to this Section (including additional amounts paid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with
respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect
to such refund), provided that such indemnifying party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over pursuant to this subsection (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by
the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
subsection, in no event will the Administrative Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net
after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
(g)      USA Patriot Act Notice; Compliance.   In order for the
Administrative Agent to comply with the Patriot Act, prior to any Lender or Participant that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States of America becoming a party hereto, the Administrative Agent may request, and
such Lender or Participant shall provide to the Administrative Agent, its name, address, tax identification number and/or such other identification information as shall be necessary for the Administrative Agent to comply with federal law.
 ARTICLE IV. YIELD PROTECTION, ETC. 
Section 4.1.  Additional Costs; Capital Adequacy. 
(a)      Capital Adequacy.   If any Lender or any Participant
determines that any Regulatory Change affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or such Participant, or any corporation controlling such Lender or such Participant, as a

  - 28 - 



consequence of, or with reference to, such Lenders or such Participants or such corporations Commitment or its making or maintaining its Loan below the rate which such Lender or
such Participant or such corporation controlling such Lender or such Participant could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change (taking into account the policies of such Lender or such Participant or such corporation with regard to capital),
then the Borrower shall, from time to time, within thirty (30) calendar days after written demand by such Lender or such Participant, pay to such Lender or such Participant additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such
Participant or such corporation controlling such Lender or such Participant to the extent that such Lender or such Participant determines such increase in capital is allocable to such Lenders or such Participants obligations hereunder.
Such Lender or such Participant shall deliver to the Borrower, pursuant to Section 4.1.(d), a written statement, setting forth the basis for the request for such additional amounts under this subsection. 
(b)       Additional Costs.   In addition to, and not in
limitation of the immediately preceding subsection (a), the Borrower shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of a Lender from time to time such amounts as such Lender may determine to be necessary to compensate such
Lender for any costs incurred by such Lender that it reasonably determines are attributable to its making or maintaining of any LIBOR Loans or its obligation to make any LIBOR Loans hereunder, any reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender
under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in respect of any of such LIBOR Loans or such obligation or the maintenance by such Lender of capital in respect of its LIBOR Loans or its Commitment (such increases in costs and reductions in
amounts receivable being herein called Additional Costs), resulting from any Regulatory Change that: (i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in
respect of any of such LIBOR Loans or its Commitment (other than taxes imposed on or measured by the overall net income of such Lender or of its Lending Office for any of such LIBOR Loans by the jurisdiction in which such Lender has its principal
office or such Lending Office), or (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit or similar requirements (other than Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or other similar reserve requirement
applicable to any other category of liabilities or category of extensions of credit or other assets by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans is determined to the extent utilized when determining LIBOR for such Loans) relating to any
extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by such Lender (or its parent corporation), or any commitment of such Lender (including, without
limitation, the Commitment of such Lender hereunder) or (iii) has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Lender to a level below that which such Lender could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change
(taking into consideration such Lenders policies with respect to capital adequacy). 
(c)       Lenders Suspension of LIBOR Loans.   Without
limiting the effect of the provisions of the immediately preceding subsections (a) and (b), if by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Lender either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of
the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Lender that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets
of such Lender that includes LIBOR Loans or (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets that it may hold, then, if such Lender so elects by notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), the obligation of such Lender to make or Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in which case the provision of Section 4.5. shall
apply).  (d)       Notification and Determination of Additional
Costs.   Each of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, as the case may be, agrees to notify the Borrower of any event occurring after the Agreement Date entitling such Person to compensation under any of the preceding
subsections of this Section as promptly as practicable; provided, however, that the failure of any such Person to give such 
  - 29 - 



notice shall not release the Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder. The Administrative Agent and each Lender, as the case may be, agrees to furnish to the Borrower (and in the case of a
Lender to the Administrative Agent as well) a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request for compensation under this Section. Determinations by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of the effect of any
Regulatory Change shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis and in good faith. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any of the preceding subsections of this Section 4.1., the Borrower shall not
be required to compensate any Lender or Participant for any such increased costs or reduced return incurred by such Lender or Participant more than six (6) months prior to such Lenders or Participants written request to the Borrower
for such compensation.  Section 4.2.  Suspension of LIBOR Loans. 
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of LIBOR for any Interest Period:
 (a)        the Administrative Agent reasonably
determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of LIBOR are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of
determining rates of interest for LIBOR Loans as provided herein or is otherwise unable to determine LIBOR, or  (b)        the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that the relevant rates of interest referred to in the
definition of LIBOR upon the basis of which the rate of interest for LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period is to be determined are not likely to adequately cover the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period;
 then the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower and each Lender prompt notice thereof and, so long as such condition
remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to, and shall not Continue LIBOR Loans or Convert Loans into LIBOR Loans. 
Section 4.3.  Illegality.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding) that it is unlawful for such Lender to honor its obligation to
maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof (with a copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent) and such Lenders obligation to Continue, or to Convert Loans of any other Type into, LIBOR
Loans shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again maintain LIBOR Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 4.5. shall be applicable).  Section 4.4.  Compensation.  The Borrower
shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender, upon the request of such Lender through the Administrative Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Lender for any loss, cost or expense that the
Administrative Agent reasonably determines is attributable to: 
  - 30 - 


(a)        any
payment or prepayment (whether mandatory or optional) of a LIBOR Loan or Conversion of a LIBOR Loan, made by such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, acceleration) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such
Loan; or  (b)        any failure by the Borrower for
any reason (including, without limitation, the failure of any of the applicable conditions precedent specified in Article V. to be satisfied) to borrow a LIBOR Loan from such Lender on the date for such borrowing, or to Convert a Base Rate Loan into
a LIBOR Loan or Continue a LIBOR Loan on the requested date of such Conversion or Continuation.  Not in limitation of the
foregoing, such compensation shall include, without limitation; (i) in the case of a LIBOR Loan, an amount equal to the then present value of (A) the amount of interest that would have accrued on such LIBOR Loan for the remainder of the
Interest Period at the rate applicable to such LIBOR Loan, less (B) the amount of interest that would accrue on the same LIBOR Loan for the same period if LIBOR were set on the date on which such LIBOR Loan was repaid, prepaid or Converted or
the date on which the Borrower failed to borrow, Convert or Continue such LIBOR Loan, as applicable, calculating present value by using as a discount rate LIBOR quoted on such date. Upon Borrowers request, the Administrative Agent will provide
to the Borrower, on behalf of any Lender seeking compensation under this Section, a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining the amount thereof. Any such statement shall
be conclusive absent manifest error.  Section 4.5.  Treatment of Affected Loans. 
If the obligation of any Lender to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant
to Section 4.1.(c), 4.2. or 4.3. then such Lenders LIBOR Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for LIBOR Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion required by
Section 4.1.(c) or 4.2. on such earlier date as such Lender may specify to the Borrower with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in
Section 4.1.(c), 4.2. or 4.3. that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist: 
(a)        to the extent that such Lenders LIBOR Loans have
been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lenders LIBOR Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and 
(b)        any portion of such Lenders Loan that would
otherwise be Continued by such Lender as LIBOR Loans shall be Continued instead as a Base Rate Loan, and any Base Rate Loan of such Lender that would otherwise be Converted into a LIBOR Loan shall remain as a Base Rate Loan. 
If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) that the circumstances specified in
Section 4.1. or 4.3. that gave rise to the Conversion of such Lenders LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when LIBOR Loans made
by other Lenders are outstanding, then such Lenders Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding LIBOR Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving
effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding LIBOR Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, Types and Interest Periods) in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amount of the Loan held by each Lender.

  - 31 - 


Section 4.6.  Change of Lending Office. 
Each Lender agrees that it will use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory
restrictions) to designate an alternate Lending Office or take other measures with respect to its Loan affected by the matters or circumstances described in Sections 3.11., 4.1. or 4.3. to reduce the liability of the Borrower or avoid the
results provided thereunder, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender as determined by such Lender in its sole discretion, except that such Lender shall have no obligation to designate a Lending Office located in the United
States of America.  Section 4.7.  Affected Lenders. 
If (a) a Lender requests compensation pursuant to Section 3.11. or 4.1. or is a Lender that sold a
participation to a Participant that requests compensation pursuant to Section 3.11. or 4.1., and the Requisite Lenders are not also doing the same, (b) the obligation of any Lender to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR
Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 4.1., 4.2. or 4.3. but the obligation of the Requisite Lenders shall not have been suspended under such Sections or (c) a Lender does not vote in favor of any amendment, modification or waiver
to this Agreement or any other Loan Document which, pursuant to Section 12.6.(b), requires the vote of such Lender, and the Requisite Lenders shall have voted in favor of such amendment, modification or waiver, then, so long as there does not
then exist any Default or Event of Default, the Borrower may either (i) demand that such Lender, (the Affected Lender), and upon such demand the Affected Lender shall promptly, assign its Loan to an Eligible Assignee subject to and
in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.6.(b) for a purchase price equal to the principal balance of the Loan then owing to the Affected Lender, plus any accrued but unpaid interest and accrued but unpaid fees owing to the Affected
Lender or (ii) pay to the Affected Lender the aggregate principal balance of the Loans then owing to the Affected Lender, plus any accrued but unpaid interest and accrued but unpaid fees owing to the Affected Lender, and by written notice to
such Affected Lender, terminate such Affected Lenders Commitment, whereupon the Affected Lender shall no longer be a party hereto or have any rights or obligations hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents (but shall continue to be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.11., 4.1., 4.4., 12.2. and 12.10. and the other provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as provided in Section 12.11. with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the
effective date of such payment). Each of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Affected Lender shall reasonably cooperate in effectuating the replacement of such Affected Lender under this Section, but at no time shall the Administrative
Agent, such Affected Lender, any other Lender or any Titled Agent be obligated in any way whatsoever to initiate any such replacement or to assist in finding an Eligible Assignee. The exercise by the Borrower of its rights under this Section shall
be at the Borrowers sole cost and expense and at no cost or expense to the Administrative Agent, the Affected Lender or any of the other Lenders; provided, however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Borrower shall
not be obligated to reimburse or otherwise pay an Affected Lenders administrative or legal costs incurred as a result of the Borrowers exercise of its rights under this Section. The terms of this Section shall not in any way limit the
Borrowers obligation to pay to any Affected Lender compensation owing to such Affected Lender pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, pursuant to Sections 3.11., 4.1. or 4.4.) with respect to any period up to the date
of replacement.  Section 4.8.  Assumptions Concerning Funding of LIBOR Loans. 
Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Article IV. shall be made as though such Lender had
actually funded LIBOR Loans through the purchase of deposits in the relevant market bearing interest at the rate applicable to such LIBOR Loans, in an amount equal to the amount of the LIBOR Loans and having a maturity comparable to the relevant
Interest Period; provided, however, that 
  - 32 - 



each Lender may fund each of its LIBOR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be used only for calculation of amounts payable under this Article IV.

 ARTICLE VI. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
Section 6.1.  Representations and Warranties. 
In order to induce the Administrative Agent and each Lender to enter into this Agreement and to make Loans, the Borrower
represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender as follows: 
(a)       Organization; Power; Qualification.   Each of the
Borrower, Realty Income and the Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal entity, duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing under the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation,
has the power and authority to own or lease its respective properties and to carry on its respective business as now being and hereafter proposed to be conducted and is duly qualified and is in good standing as a foreign corporation, limited
liability company, partnership or other legal entity, and authorized to do business, in each jurisdiction in which the character of its properties or the nature of its business requires such qualification or authorization and where the failure to be
so qualified or authorized could reasonably be expected to have, in each instance, a Material Adverse Effect. 
(b)       Ownership Structure.  Part I of Schedule 6.1.(b) is,
as of the Agr

rmance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Borrower or Realty Income is a party in accordance with their respective terms and the borrowings and
other extensions of credit hereunder do not and will not, by the passage of time, the giving of notice, or both: (i) require any Governmental Approval or violate any Applicable Law (including all Environmental Laws) relating to the Borrower or
Realty Income; (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute a default under the certificate of limited partnership or partnership agreement of the Borrower or the organizational documents of Realty Income, or any material indenture,
agreement or other instrument to which the Borrower or Realty Income is a party or by which it or any of its respective properties may be bound; or (iii) result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to any
property now owned or hereafter acquired by the Borrower or Realty Income other than in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders.  (e)       Compliance with Law; Governmental Approvals.   Each of the Borrower, Realty Income and each Subsidiary is in compliance with each
Governmental Approval and all other Applicable Laws relating to it except for noncompliances which, and Governmental Approvals the failure to possess which, could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to cause an Event of
Default or have a Material Adverse Effect. 
(f)       Litigation.   Except as set forth on
Schedule 6.1.(f), there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending (nor, to the knowledge of either the Borrower or Realty Income, are there any actions, suits or proceedings threatened) against or in any other way relating adversely to or
affecting, the Borrower, Realty Income, any Subsidiary or any of their respective property in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any other Governmental Authority which, (i) is reasonably likely to be adversely
determined, and, if adversely determine

enging or questioning the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual Property. 
(p)       Business.  As of the Agreement Date, the Borrower, Realty
Income and the Subsidiaries are engaged primarily in the business of owning, funding the development of, operating, buying, selling and managing completed retail properties leased to third party tenants principally, but not exclusively, on a net
lease basis.  (q)       Brokers Fees.  No
brokers or finders fee, commission or similar compensation will be payable with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. No other similar fees or commissions will be payable by the Borrower or Realty Income for any other services
rendered to the Borrower or Realty Income or any Subsidiaries ancillary to the transactions contemplated hereby.  (r)       Accuracy and Completeness of Information.  All written information, reports and other papers and data (other than financial projections and
other forward looking statements) furnished to the Administrative Agent or any Lender by, or at the direction of, the Borrower, Realty Income or any Subsidiary were, at the time the same were so furnished and when taken as a whole, complete and
correct in all material respects, to the extent necessary to give the recipient a true and accurate knowledge of the subject matter, or, in the case of financial statements, present fairly, in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the
periods involved, the financial position of the Persons involved as at the date thereof and the results of operations for such periods (subject, as to interim statements, to changes resulting from normal year end audit adjustments and absence of
full footnote disclosure). All financial projections and other forward looking statements prepared by or on behalf of the Borrower, Realty Income or any Subsidiary that have been or may hereafter be made available to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender were or will be prepared in good faith based on reasonable assumptions. No fact is known to the Borrower or Realty Income which has had, or may in the future have (so far as the Borrower or Realty Income can reasonably foresee), a Material
Adverse Effect which has not been set forth in such information, reports or other papers or data or otherwise disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders prior to the Agreement Date. No document furnished or written statement
made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender by, or at the direction of, the Borrower, Realty Income or any Subsidiary in connection with the negotiation, preparation or execution of, or pursuant to, this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, when taken as a whole with all other such documents and statements, contains or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein not materially misleading.  (s)       Not Plan Assets; No
Prohibited Transactions.  None of the assets of the Borrower, Realty Income or any Subsidiary constitutes plan assets within the meaning of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code and the respective regulations promulgated
thereunder. Assuming that no Lender funds any amount payable by it hereunder with plan assets, as that term is defined in 29 C.F.R. 2510.3-101, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and
the extensions of credit and repayment of amounts hereunder, do not and will not constitute prohibited transactions under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code. 
  - 39 - 


(t)       OFAC.  None of
the Borrower, Realty Income, any of the Subsidiaries, or any other Affiliate of the Borrower: (i) is a person named on the list of Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons maintained by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office

be deemed to be made at and as of the Agreement Date, the Effective Date, and at and as of the date of the occurrence of each Credit Event, except to the extent that such representations and warranties expressly relate solely to an earlier date (in
which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent otherwise qualified by materiality, in which case such representation or warranty shall have been true and correct in all
respects) on and as of such earlier date) and except for changes in factual circumstances specifically permitted hereunder or as waived or consented to by the Requisite Lenders in accordance with Section 12.7. All such representations and

Section 7.7.  Books and Records; Inspections.

Borrower shall, and shall cause Realty Income and each Subsidiary to, duly and punctually perform and comply with all terms and conditions of all Material Contracts to which it is a party, the failure of which to comply would permit any other party

(A) the principal of, and accrued interest on, the Loans and the Notes at the time outstanding and (B) all of the other Obligations, including, but not limited to, the other amounts owed to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under

at any time after acceleration of the maturity of the Loans and the other Obligations, the Borrower shall pay all arrears of interest and all payments on account of principal of the Obligations which shall have become due otherwise than by
acceleration (with interest on principal and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, on overdue interest, at the rates specified in this Agreement) and all Events of Default and Defaults (other than nonpayment of principal of and accrued
interest on the Obligations due and payable solely by virtue of acceleration) shall become remedied or waived to the satisfaction of the Requisite Lenders, then by written notice to the Borrower, the Requisite Lenders may elect, in the sole
discretion of such Requisite Lenders, to rescind and annul the acceleration and its consequences. The provisions of the preceding sentence are intended merely to bind all of the Lenders to a decision which may be made at the election of the
Requisite Lenders, and are not intended to benefit the Borrower and do not give the Borrower the right to require the Lenders to rescind or annul any acceleration hereunder, even if the conditions set forth herein are satisfied. 
Section 10.3.  Marshaling; Payments Set Aside. 
None of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Specified Derivatives Provider shall be under any obligation to
marshal any assets in favor of any Loan Party or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations or the Specified Derivatives Obligations. To the extent that any Loan Party makes a payment or payments to the Administrative
Agent, any Lender or any Specified Derivatives Provider, or the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Specified Derivatives Provider enforce their security interests or exercise their rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds
of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal
law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such recovery, the Obligations or Specified Derivatives Obligations, or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived and
continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred. 
Section 10.4.  Allocation of Proceeds.  If an Event of Default exists, all payments received by the Administrative Agent under any of the Loan Documents, in respect of any principal of or interest on the Obligations or any other amounts payable
by the Borrower hereunder or thereunder, shall be applied in the following order and priority: 
(a)       amounts due to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in
respect of expenses due under Section 12.2. until paid in full, and then Fees;

ratable benefit of the Lenders;  (c)       payments of
principal of all Loans and payments of the Derivatives Termination Value in respect of any and all Specified Derivatives Contracts, to be paid to the Lenders and the Specified Derivatives Providers equally and ratably in accordance with the
respective amounts thereof then due and owing to such Persons; 
(d)       amounts due to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
pursuant to Sections 11.7. and 12.10.;

shall be paid to the Borrower or whomever else may be legally entitled thereto.  Section 10.5.  Performance by
Administrative Agent.  If the Borrower or any other Loan Party shall fail to perform any covenant, duty or
agreement contained in any of the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent may perform or attempt to perform such covenant, duty or agreement on behalf of the Borrower or such other Loan Party after the expiration of any cure or grace periods set
forth herein. In such event, the Borrower shall, at the request of the Administrative Agent, promptly pay any amount reasonably expended by the Administrative Agent in such performance or attempted performance to the Administrative Agent, together
with interest thereon at the applicable Post-Default Rate from the date of such expenditure until paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever for the
performance of any obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.  Section 10.6.  Rights
Cumulative.  (a)        Generally.  The rights
and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement, each of the other Loan Documents shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any of them may otherwise have under Applicable Law. In exercising
their respective rights and remedies the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may be selective and no failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of it, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any power or right preclude its other or further exercise or the exercise of any other power or right.  (b)        Enforcement by Administrative Agent.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan
Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement
shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance with Article X. for the benefit of all the Lenders; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) the Administrative Agent from exercising on
its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (ii) any Specified Derivatives Provider from exercising the rights and remedies that
inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Specified Derivatives Provider) hereunder, under the other Loan Documents or under any Specified Derivatives Contract, as applicable, (iii) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance
with Section 12.4. (subject to the terms of Section 3.3.), or (iv) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Loan Party under any
Debtor Relief Law; and provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (x) the Requisite Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Article X. and (y) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 3.3., any Lender may, with the consent of the Requisite
Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Requisite Lenders. 
  - 54 - 


ARTICLE XI. THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT  Section 11.1.  Appointment and Authorization. 
Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as contractual
representative on such Lenders behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Not in limitation of the foregoing, each Lender authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent to enter into the Loan Documents (other than this Agreement) for the benefit of the Lenders. Each Lender hereby agrees
that, except as otherwise set forth herein, any action taken by the Requisite Lenders in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or the Loan Documents, and the exercise by the Requisite Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein,
together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of the Lenders. Nothing herein shall be construed to deem the Administrative Agent a trustee or fiduciary for any Lender or to impose on
the Administrative Agent duties or obligations other than those expressly provided for herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the terms Agent, Administrative Agent, agent and similar
terms in the Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any Applicable Law. Instead, use of such terms is merely a
matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. The Administrative Agent shall deliver to each Lender, promptly upon receipt thereof by the Administrative
Agent, copies of each of the financial statements, certificates, notices and other documents delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Article VIII. that the Borrower is not otherwise required to deliver directly to the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent will also furnish to any Lender, upon the request of such Lender, a copy (or, where appropriate, an original) of any document, instrument, agreement, certificate or notice furnished to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower,
any other Loan Party or any other Affiliate of the Borrower, pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document not already delivered to such Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any such other Loan Document. As to any matters not
expressly provided for by the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of any of the Obligations), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to
act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Requisite Lenders (or all of the Lenders if explicitly required under any other provision of this Agreement), and such
instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of any of the Obligations; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which
exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or Applicable Law. Not in limitation of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may exercise any right or remedy it or the
Lenders may have under any Loan Document upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default unless the Requisite Lenders have directed the Administrative Agent otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action
whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of the Requisite Lenders, or where
applicable, all the Lenders.  Section 11.2.  Agents Reliance, Etc. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, neither the Administrative Agent nor
any of its directors, officers, agents, employees or counsel shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct in connection with its duties 
  - 55 - 



expressly set forth herein or therein as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative
Agent: may consult with legal counsel (including its own counsel or counsel for the Borrower or any other Loan Party), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents, employees or counsel: (a) makes any warranty or representation to any
Lender or any other Person and shall be responsible to any Lender or any other Person for any statement, warranty or representation made or deemed made by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person in or in connection with this Agreement
or any other Loan Document; (b) shall have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the satisfaction of any conditions
precedent under this Agreement or any Loan Document on the part of the Borrower or other Persons or inspect the property, books or records of the Borrower or any other Person; (c) shall be responsible to any Lender for the due execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto or any collateral covered thereby or the perfection or priority of any
Lien in favor of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders in any such collateral; (d) shall have any liability in respect of any recitals, statements, certifications, representations or warranties contained in any of the Loan Documents
or any other document, instrument, agreement, certificate or statement delivered in connection therewith; and (e) shall incur any liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent,
certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail) believed by it to be genuine and signed, sent or given by the proper party or parties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under
the Loan Documents by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 Section 11.3.  Notice of Defaults. 
The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of
Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing with reasonable specificity such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of
default. If any Lender (excluding the Lender which is also serving as the Administrative Agent) becomes aware of any Default or Event of Default, it shall promptly send to the Administrative Agent such a notice of default. Further,
if the Administrative Agent receives such a notice of default, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.  Section 11.4.  Wells Fargo as Lender. 
Wells Fargo, as a Lender, shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and any other Loan Document as any
other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent; and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Wells Fargo in each case in its individual capacity.
Wells Fargo and its Affiliates may each accept deposits from, maintain deposits or credit balances for, invest in, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, serve as financial advisor to, and generally engage in any kind of business with
the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Affiliate thereof as if it were any other bank and without any duty to account therefor to the other Lenders. Further, the Administrative Agent and any Affiliate may accept fees and other consideration
from the Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to the other Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Wells Fargo or its Affiliates may receive
information regarding the Borrower, 
  - 56 - 



other Loan Parties, Subsidiaries and other Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Person) and acknowledge that the Administrative
Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them.  Section 11.5.  Approvals of Lenders.
 All communications from the Administrative Agent to any Lender requesting such Lenders
determination, consent, approval or disapproval (a) shall be given in the form of a written notice to such Lender, (b) shall be accompanied by a description of the matter or issue as to which such determination, approval, consent or
disapproval is requested, or shall advise such Lender where information, if any, regarding such matter or issue may be inspected, or shall otherwise describe the matter or issue to be resolved, (c) shall include, if reasonably requested by such
Lender and to the extent not previously provided to such Lender, written materials and, as appropriate, a brief summary of all oral information provided to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower in respect of the matter or issue to be resolved,
and (d) shall include the Administrative Agents recommended course of action or determination in respect thereof. Unless a Lender shall give written notice to the Administrative Agent that it specifically objects to the recommendation or
determination of the Administrative Agent (together with a written explanation providing in reasonable detail the reasons behind such objection) within 10 Business Days (or such other period as may be specifically required under the express terms of
the Loan Documents) of receipt of such communication, such Lender shall be deemed to have conclusively approved of or consented to such recommendation or determination.  Section 11.6.  Lender Credit Decision, Etc. 
Each Lender expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, counsel, attorneys-in-fact or other Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to such Lender and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower, any other
Loan Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, shall be deemed to constitute any such representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has made its own credit and legal analysis and decision to enter
into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or counsel to the Administrative Agent, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents or counsel, and based on the financial statements of the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, the Subsidiaries and other Affiliates, and inquiries of such Persons, its independent due diligence of the business and affairs of the Borrower, the
other Loan Parties, the Subsidiaries and other Persons, its review of the Loan Documents, the legal opinions required to be delivered to it hereunder, the advice of its own counsel and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or counsel to the Administrative Agent or any of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents,
and based on such review, advice, documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under the Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep
itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Borrower or any other Loan Party of the Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for therein or to inspect the properties or books of, or make any other investigation of,
the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any Subsidiary. Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower, any
other Loan Party or any other Affiliate thereof which may come into possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or other 
  - 57 - 



Affiliates. Each Lender acknowledges that the Administrative Agents legal counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is only acting as counsel to the
Administrative Agent and is not acting as counsel to such Lender.  Section 11.7.  Indemnification of Agent. 
Regardless of whether the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are consummated, each
Lender agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) pro rata in accordance with such Lenders respective Credit Percentage, from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the
Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent but not as a Lender) in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents, any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by
the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents (collectively, Indemnifiable Amounts); provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such Indemnifiable Amounts to the extent resulting from the Administrative
Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment provided, however, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Requisite Lenders (or all
Lenders, if expressly required hereunder) shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent
(to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the counsel to the
Administrative Agent) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, administration, or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise) of, or legal advice with respect to
the rights or responsibilities of the parties under, the Loan Documents, any suit or action brought by the Administrative Agent to enforce the terms of the Loan Documents and/or collect any Obligations, any lender liability suit or claim
brought against the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders, and any claim or suit brought against the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders arising under any Environmental Laws. Such out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) shall be
advanced by the Lenders on the request of the Administrative Agent notwithstanding any claim or assertion that the Administrative Agent is not entitled to indemnification hereunder upon receipt of an undertaking by the Administrative Agent that the
Administrative Agent will reimburse the Lenders if it is actually and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Administrative Agent is not so entitled to indemnification. The agreements in this Section shall survive the
payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and the termination of this Agreement. If the Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for any Indemnifiable Amount following payment by any
Lender to the Administrative Agent in respect of such Indemnifiable Amount pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall share such reimbursement on a ratable basis with each Lender making any such payment. 
Section 11.8.  Successor Agent.  The Administrative Agent may resign at any time as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Requisite
Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which appointment shall, provided no Default or Event of Default exists, be subject to the Borrowers approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed (except that the Borrower shall, in all events, be deemed to have approved each Lender and any of its Affiliates as a successor Administrative Agent). If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed in accordance with the
immediately 
  - 58 - 



preceding sentence, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the resigning Administrative Agents giving of notice of resignation, then the resigning Administrative
Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a Lender, if any Lender shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be an Eligible Assignee. The current Administrative Agent shall continue to act as
Administrative Agent hereunder until the earlier of (a) 30 days after the then current Administrative Agents resignation of the Administrative Agent or (b) the date on which a successor Administrative Agent is appointed by the
Requisite Lenders. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the current Administrative Agent, and the current Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. After any Administrative Agents resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent,
the provisions of this Article XII. shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the Administrative Agent may assign its rights and duties under the Loan Documents to any of its Affiliates by giving the Borrower and each Lender prior written notice.  Section 11.9.  Titled Agents.  The Joint
Lead Arrangers and the Joint Bookrunners (each a Titled Agent) in each such respective capacity, assume no responsibility or obligation hereunder, including, without limitation, for servicing, enforcement or collection of any of the
Loans, nor any duties as an agent hereunder for the Lenders. The titles given to the Titled Agents are solely honorific and imply no fiduciary responsibility on the part of the Titled Agents to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Borrower or
any other Loan Party and the use of such titles does not impose on the Titled Agents any duties or obligations greater than those of any other Lender or entitle the Titled Agents to any rights other than those to which any other Lender is entitled.

To such Lenders address or telecopy number as set forth in the applicable Administrative Questionnaire 
or, as to each party at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties delivered in
compliance with this Section; provided, a Lender shall only be required to give notice of any such other address to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. All such notices and other communications shall be effective (i) if mailed, upon the

the addresses specified; (ii) if telecopied, when transmitted; (iii) if hand delivered or sent by overnight courier, when delivered; or (iv) if delivered in accordance with Section 8.3., as described therein; provided, however,
that, in the case of the immediately preceding clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), non-receipt of any communication as of the result of any change of address of which the sending party was not notified or as the result of a refusal to accept delivery
shall be deemed receipt of such communication. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, all notices or communications to the Administrative Agent or any Lender under Article II. shall be effective only when actually received. None of

Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, believes in good faith to have been given by a Person authorized to deliver such notice or for otherwise acting in good faith hereunder. Failure of a Person designated to get a copy of a notice to receive
such copy shall not affect the validity of notice properly given to another Person.  Section 12.2.  Expenses.
 The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent for all of its reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution of, and any amendment, supplement or modification to, any of the Loan Documents (including due diligence expense and reasonable travel
expenses related to closing), and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent and all costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent in
connection with 
  - 60 - 



the use of IntraLinks or other similar information transmission systems in connection with the Loan Documents and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent
relating to all such activities, (b) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for all their costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under the Loan Documents, limited in
the case of counsel to the reasonable fees and disbursements of one firm of counsel (including the allocated fees and expenses of in-house counsel) to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and, if necessary, one firm of local counsel in each
appropriate jurisdiction (and, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest among the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, one additional counsel in each relevant jurisdiction to each group of affected parties similarly situated) and
any payments in indemnification or otherwise payable by the Lenders to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Loan Documents, (c) to pay, and indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and the Lenders from, any and all recording and
filing fees and any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any failure to pay or delay in paying, documentary, stamp, excise and other similar taxes, if any, which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the
execution and delivery of any of the Loan Documents, or consummation of any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, any Loan Document and (d) to the extent not already covered by any of the
preceding subsections, to pay or reimburse the fees and disbursements of counsel (subject to the limitations set forth in clause (b) above) to the Administrative Agent and any Lender incurred in connection with the representation of the
Administrative Agent or such Lender in any matter relating to or arising out of any bankruptcy or other proceeding of the type described in Sections 10.1.(e) or 10.1.(f) including, without limitation (i) any motion for relief from any stay
or similar order, (ii) the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of any document relating to the Obligations and (iii) the negotiation and preparation of any debtor-in-possession financing or any plan of reorganization of the
Borrower or any other Loan Party, whether proposed by the Borrower, such Loan Party, the Lenders or any other Person, and whether such fees and expenses are incurred prior to, during or after the commencement of such proceeding or the confirmation
or conclusion of any such proceeding. If the Borrower shall fail to pay any amounts required to be paid by it pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders may pay such amounts on behalf of the Borrower and such amounts shall
be deemed to be Obligations owing hereunder.  Section 12.3.  Stamp, Intangible and Recording Taxes. 
The Borrower will pay any and all stamp, excise, intangible, registration, recordation and similar taxes, fees or charges
and shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay in the payment or omission to pay any such taxes, fees or charges, which may be payable or determined to be
payable in connection with the execution, delivery, recording, performance or enforcement of this Agreement, the Notes and any of the other Loan Documents, the amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of or consent under this Agreement, the
Notes or any of the other Loan Documents or the perfection of any rights or Liens under this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents.  Section 12.4.  Setoff.  Subject to
Section 3.3. and in addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under Applicable Law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, the Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, each Lender, each Affiliate of the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, and each Participant, at any time or from time to time while an Event of Default exists, without notice to the Borrower or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, but in the case of a Lender, an
Affiliate of a Lender, or a Participant, subject to receipt of the prior written consent of the Requisite Lenders exercised in their sole discretion, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including, but
not limited to, indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or 
  - 61 - 



unmatured) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by the Administrative Agent, such Lender, any Affiliate of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, or such Participant, to or for
the credit or the account of the Borrower against and on account of any of the Obligations, irrespective of whether or not any or all of the Loans and all other Obligations have been declared to be, or have otherwise become, due and payable as
permitted by Section 10.2., and although such Obligations shall be contingent or unmatured. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, if any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set
off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.10. and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed
held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting
Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.  Section 12.5.  Litigation; Jurisdiction; Other Matters; Waivers.
 (a)       EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY DISPUTE OR
CONTROVERSY BETWEEN OR AMONG THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY OF THE LENDERS WOULD BE BASED ON DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX ISSUES OF LAW AND FACT AND WOULD RESULT IN DELAY AND EXPENSE TO THE PARTIES. ACCORDINGLY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF THE LENDERS, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR NATURE IN ANY COURT OR TRIBUNAL IN WHICH AN ACTION MAY BE COMMENCED BY OR AGAINST
ANY PARTY HERETO ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR BY REASON OF ANY OTHER SUIT, CAUSE OF ACTION OR DISPUTE WHATSOEVER BETWEEN OR AMONG THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY OF THE LENDERS OF ANY KIND OR
NATURE RELATING TO ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS.  (b)       EACH OF THE
BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH LENDER HEREBY AGREES THAT THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT OF THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA OR ANY STATE COURT LOCATED IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, SHALL HAVE JURISDICTION TO HEAR AND DETERMINE ANY CLAIMS
OR DISPUTES BETWEEN OR AMONG THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY OF THE LENDERS, PERTAINING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE LOANS, THE NOTES, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR TO ANY MATTER ARISING HEREFROM OR THEREFROM. THE
BORROWER, EACH OF THE LENDERS EXPRESSLY SUBMIT AND CONSENT IN ADVANCE TO SUCH JURISDICTION IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING COMMENCED IN SUCH COURTS. THE BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT, OR OTHER PROCESS OR PAPERS
ISSUED THEREIN, AND AGREES THAT SERVICE OF SUCH SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT, OR OTHER PROCESS OR PAPERS MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL ADDRESSED TO THE BORROWER AT ITS ADDRESS FOR NOTICES PROVIDED FOR HEREIN. SHOULD THE BORROWER FAIL TO
APPEAR OR ANSWER ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT, PROCESS OR PAPERS SO SERVED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AFTER THE MAILING THEREOF, THE BORROWER SHALL BE DEEMED IN DEFAULT AND AN ORDER AND/OR JUDGMENT MAY BE ENTERED AGAINST IT AS DEMANDED OR PRAYED FOR IN SUCH
SUMMONS, COMPLAINT, PROCESS OR PAPERS. EACH PARTY FURTHER WAIVES ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING WAS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM
AND EACH AGREES NOT TO 
  - 62 - 



PLEAD OR CLAIM THE SAME. THE CHOICE OF FORUM SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO PRECLUDE THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR THE ENFORCEMENT BY
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OF ANY JUDGMENT OBTAINED IN SUCH FORUM IN ANY OTHER APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION.  (c)        THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY EACH PARTY WITH THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND WITH A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES
THEREOF, AND SHALL SURVIVE THE PAYMENT OF THE LOANS AND ALL OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE HEREUNDER OR UNDER THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS 

 to hear and determine all of the issues in such action or proceeding
(whether of fact or of law) and to report a statement of decision, provided that, at the option of any party to such proceeding, any such issues pertaining to a provisional remedy as defined in California Code of Civil Procedure
Section 1281.8 may be heard and determined by the court, and (ii) without limiting the generality of Section 12.2., the Borrower will be solely responsible to pay all fees and expenses of any referee appointed in such action or
proceeding.  Section 12.6.  Successors and Assigns. 
(a)        Successors and Assigns Generally.  The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except
(i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of the immediately following subsection (b), (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of the immediately following subsection (d) or
(iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest, subject to the restrictions of the immediately following subsection (f) (and subject to the last sentence of the immediately following subsection (b), any other attempted
assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted
hereby, Participants to the extent provided in the immediately following subsection (d) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or by reason of this Agreement.  (b)        Assignments
by Lenders.  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it);
provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(i)         Minimum Amounts. 
(A)      in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of an
assigning Lenders Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it, or in the case of 
  - 63 - 



an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
(B)      in any case not described in the immediately preceding
subsection (A), the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning
Lender, subject to each such assignment (in each case, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and
Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $10,000,000, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall exist, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); provided, however, that if, after giving effect to such assignment, the amount of the Commitment held by such assigning Lender or the outstanding principal balance of the Loans of such assigning Lender, as applicable, would be
less than $10,000,000, then such assigning Lender shall assign the entire amount of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it.  (ii)        Proportionate Amounts.  Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned.  (iii)       Required Consents.  No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by clause (i)(B) of this subsection
and, in addition:  (A)      the consent of the Borrower (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) a Default or Event of Default shall exist at the time of such assignment or (y) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund;
provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 5 Business Days after having received notice thereof; and 
(B)      the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of a Commitment if such assignment is to a Person that is not already a Lender with a Commitment, an Affiliate of such a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such a
Lender.  (iv)        Assignment and Acceptance;
Notes.    The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $4,500 for each assignment, and the assignee, if
it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. Unless the transferor Lender or the assignee Lender requests otherwise, upon the consummation of any assignment, the transferor Lender, the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes are issued to the assignee Lender and such transferor Lender, as appropriate. 
(v)         No Assignment to Certain
Persons.  No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or to any Person who, upon becoming a Lender
hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B). 
  - 64 - 


(vi)         No Assignment to Natural
Persons.   No such assignment shall be made to a natural person. 
(vii)        Certain Additional Payments.  In
connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall
make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other
compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and
assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire
(and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans in accordance with its Credit Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become
effective under Applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
(viii)       Assignments by Specified Derivatives
Provider.  If the assigning Lender (or its Affiliate) is a Specified Derivatives Provider and if after giving effect to such assignment such Lender will hold no further Loans or Commitments under this Agreement, such Lender shall
undertake such assignment only contemporaneously with an assignment by such Lender (or its Affiliate, as the case may be) of all of its Specified Derivatives Contracts to the Assignee or another Lender (or Affiliate thereof). 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the immediately following subsection (c), from
and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a
Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption
covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.11., 4.1., 4.4., 12.2. and 12.10. and
the other provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as provided in Section 12.11. with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights
or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with the immediately following
subsection (d).  (c)         Register.  The
Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Principal Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the
Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding

  - 65 - 



notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
(d)       Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the
consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or
a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly
with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document that (i) increases such Lenders Commitment if such Participant is directly and adversely affected thereby, (ii) extends the date fixed for the payment of
principal on the Loans or portions thereof owing to such Lender, or (iii) reduces the rate at which interest is payable thereon. Subject to the immediately following subsection (e), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.11., 4.1. and 4.4. to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each
Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.4. as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.3. as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting
solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or
other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any
information relating to a Participants interest in any loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is
in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no
responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
(e)       Limitations upon Participant Rights.  A Participant shall
not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.11. and 4.1. than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent and the Borrower has expressly agreed to make any such greater payment. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.11. unless the Borrower is notified of
the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, to comply with Section 3.11.(c) as though it were a Lender. 
(f)        Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge
or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or
assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
  - 66 - 


(g)         No
Registration.  Each Lender agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, it will not make any assignment hereunder in any manner or under any circumstances that would require registration
or qualification of, or filings in respect of, any Loan or Note under the Securities Act or any other securities laws of the United States of America or of any other jurisdiction.  Section 12.7.  Amendments and Waivers. 
(a)         Generally.  Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, (i) any consent or approval required or permitted by this Agreement or any other Loan Document to be given by the Lenders may be given, (ii) any term of this Agreement or of any other Loan Document may be
amended, (iii) the performance or observance by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any Subsidiary of any terms of this Agreement or such other Loan Document may be waived, and (iv) the continuance of any Default or Event of Default may
be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with, but only with, the written consent of the Requisite Lenders (or the Administrative Agent at the written direction of the Requisite Lenders),
and, in the case of an amendment to any Loan Document, the written consent of each Loan Party which is party thereto. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Administrative Agent shall be authorized on behalf of all Lenders, without the necessity
of any notice to, or further consent from, any Lender, to waive the imposition of the late fees provided in Section 2.6. up to a maximum of 3 times per year. 
(b)         Consent of Lenders Directly Affected.  In
addition to the foregoing requirements, no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing, and signed by each of the Lenders directly and adversely affected thereby (or the Administrative Agent at the written direction of such Lenders), do
any of the following:  (i)         reduce the
principal of, or interest that has accrued or the rates of interest that will be charged on the outstanding principal amount of, any Loans or other Obligations; 
(ii)        reduce the amount of any Fees payable to the Lenders
hereunder;  (iii)       modify the definition of
Termination Date, or otherwise postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, any Loans or for the payment of Fees or any other Obligations; 
(iv)       modify the definition of Credit Percentage or
amend or otherwise modify the provisions of Section 3.2.; 
(v)        amend this Section 12.7. or amend any of the
other definitions of the terms used in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents insofar as such definitions affect the substance of this Section 12.7.; 
(vi)       modify the definition of the term Requisite
Lenders or modify in any other manner the number or percentage of the Lenders required to make any determinations or waive any rights hereunder or to modify any provision hereof; 
(vii)      release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty;
or  (viii)     waive a Default or Event of Default under
Section 10.1.(a) except as otherwise contemplated by Section 10.2.(f). 
  - 67 - 


(c)       Amendment of Administrative
Agents Duties, Etc.  No amendment, waiver or consent unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action, shall affect the rights or duties of the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. No waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or impair any right consequent thereon and any amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective only
in the specific instance and for the specific purpose set forth therein. No course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be
prejudicial thereto. Any Event of Default occurring hereunder shall continue to exist until such time as such Event of Default is waived in writing in accordance with the terms of this Section, notwithstanding any attempted cure or other action by
the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person subsequent to the occurrence of such Event of Default. Except as otherwise explicitly provided for herein or in any other Loan Document, no notice to or demand upon the Borrower shall entitle
the Borrower to other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. 
(d)       Amendments Relating to Change of Control.  If a Lender did
not affirmatively approve any amendment, modification or waiver of the provisions of Section 10.1.(l) (including any Default or Event of Default resulting under such Section) that has become effective, the Borrower (i) may cause such
Lender to assign (and such Lender shall assign) all of its rights, title and interest in its Loans and Commitment to an Eligible Assignee subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.6. or (ii) if the Borrower does not
cause such an assignment, the Borrower, upon demand of such Lender, shall pay to such Lender the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Loans then owing to such Lender, plus any accrued but unpaid interest and accrued but unpaid fees owing
to such Lender, or such other amount as may be mutually agreed upon by such Lender and Eligible Assignee, whereupon such Lender shall no longer be a party hereto or have any rights or obligations hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents
(but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.11., 4.1., 4.4., 12.2. and 12.10. and the other provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as provided in Section 12.11. with respect to facts and
circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such payment). The exercise by the Borrower of its rights under this Section shall be at the Borrowers sole cost and expense and at no cost or expense to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender.  Section 12.8.  Nonliability of Administrative Agent and Lenders. 
The relationship between the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, on the other hand,
shall be solely that of borrower and lender. None of the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower and no provision in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents, and no course of dealing
between or among any of the parties hereto, shall be deemed to create any fiduciary duty owing by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any Lender, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party. None of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrowers business or operations.  Section 12.9.  Confidentiality.  Except as
otherwise provided by Applicable Law, the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall maintain the confidentiality of all Information (as defined below) in accordance with its customary procedure for handling confidential information of this nature
and in accordance with safe and sound banking practices but in any event may make disclosure: (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other
representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential, and if such Persons do not

  - 68 - 



otherwise have a duty to maintain the confidentiality of such information, such Persons shall agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information as required herein); (b) subject to an
agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any actual or proposed assignee, Participant or other transferee in connection with a potential transfer of any Loan or participation therein as permitted
hereunder, or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations; (c) as required or requested by any Governmental Authority or representative
thereof or pursuant to legal process or in connection with any legal proceedings, or as otherwise required by Applicable Law; (d) to the Administrative Agents or such Lenders independent auditors and other professional advisors
(provided they shall be notified of the confidential nature of the information); (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies under any Loan Document (or any Specified Derivatives Contract) or any action or proceeding relating to any
Loan Document (or any such Specified Derivatives Contract) or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder; (f) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section actually
known by the Administrative Agent or such Lender to be a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a
source other than the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower; (g) to the extent requested by, or required to be disclosed to, any nationally recognized rating agency or regulatory or similar authority (including any self-regulatory
authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners) having or purporting to have jurisdiction over it; (h) to bank trade publications, such information to consist of deal terms and other information customarily found in such
publications; (i) to any other party hereto; and (j) with the consent of the Borrower or, with respect to any Information regarding ARC Real Estate Partners, LLC, with the consent of ARC Real Estate Partners, LLC. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Administrative Agent and each Lender may disclose any such confidential information, without notice to the Borrower or any other Loan Party, to Governmental Authorities in connection with any regulatory examination of the
Administrative Agent or such Lender or in accordance with the regulatory compliance policy of the Administrative Agent or such Lender. As used in this Section, the term Information means all information received from the Borrower, any
other Loan Party, any Subsidiary or Affiliate relating to any Loan Party or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to, or in the possession of, the Administrative Agent, any Lender on a nonconfidential
basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate, provided that, in the case of any such information received from the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate after the date
hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so
if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.  Section 12.10.  Indemnification. 
(a)       The Borrower shall and hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders (other than, in each case, a Defaulting Lender), all of the Affiliates of each of the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders (other than, in each case, a Defaulting Lender), and their respective directors,
officers, shareholders, agents, employees and counsel (each referred to herein as an Indemnified Party) from and against any and all of the following (collectively, the Indemnified Costs): losses, costs, claims, penalties,
damages, liabilities, deficiencies, judgments or expenses of every kind and nature (including, without limitation, amounts paid in settlement and court costs but in the case of legal counsel, limited to the reasonable fees and disbursements of one

conflict of interest among the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, one

rendered in connection therewith, but excluding Indemnified Costs indemnification in respect of which is specifically covered by Section 3.11. or 4.1. or expressly excluded from the coverage of such Sections) incurred by an Indemnified Party in
connection with, arising out of, or by reason of, any suit, cause of action, claim, arbitration, investigation or settlement, consent decree or other proceeding (the foregoing referred to herein as an Indemnity Proceeding) which is in
any way related directly or indirectly to: (i) this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) the making of any Loans hereunder; (iii) any actual or proposed use by the Borrower of the
proceeds of the Loans; (iv) the Administrative Agents or any Lenders entering into this Agreement; (v) the fact that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders have established the credit facility evidenced hereby in favor of the
Borrower; (vi) the fact that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are creditors of the Borrower and have or are alleged to have information regarding the financial condition, strategic plans or business operations of the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries; (vii) the fact that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are material creditors of the Borrower and are alleged to influence directly or indirectly the business decisions or affairs of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries or
their financial condition; (viii) the exercise of any right or remedy the Administrative Agent or the Lenders may have under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; (ix) any civil penalty or fine assessed by the OFAC against, and all
costs and expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements) incurred in connection with defense thereof by, the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of conduct of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any Subsidiary that
violates a sanction administered or enforced by the OFAC; or (x) any violation or non-compliance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Applicable Law (including any Environmental Law) including, but not limited to, any Indemnity Proceeding
commenced by (A) the Internal Revenue Service or state taxing authority or (B) any Governmental Authority or other Person under any Environmental Law, including any Indemnity Proceeding commenced by a Governmental Authority or other Person
seeking remedial or other action to cause the Borrower or its Subsidiaries (or its respective properties) (or the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders as successors to the Borrower) to be in compliance with such Environmental Laws; provided,
however, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any acts or omissions of such Indemnified Party in connection with matters described in this subsection to the extent arising from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment.  (b)       The Borrowers indemnification obligations under this Section shall apply to all Indemnity Proceedings arising out of, or related to, the foregoing
whether or not an Indemnified Party is a named party in such Indemnity Proceeding. In this connection, this indemnification shall cover all Indemnified Costs of any Indemnified Party in connection with any deposition of any Indemnified Party or
compliance with any subpoena (including any subpoena requesting the production of documents). This indemnification shall, amo

to claims against an Indemnified Party, an Indemnified Party may settle or
compromise any such Indemnity Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Borrower where (x) no monetary relief is sought against such Indemnified Party in such Indemnity Proceeding or (y) there is an allegation of a violation of
law by such Indemnified Party.  (f)        If and to the extent that
the obligations of the Borrower under this Section are unenforceable for any reason, the Borrower hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such obligations which is permissible under Applicable Law.
 (g)       The Borrowers obligations under this Section shall survive
any termination of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the payment in full in cash of the Obligations, and are in addition to, and not in substitution of, any of the other obligations set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan
Document to which it is a party.  References in this Section to Lender or Lenders shall be deemed to
include such Persons (and their Affiliates) in their capacity as Specified Derivatives Providers. 
Section 12.11.  Termination; Survival.  This Agreement shall terminate at such time as all Obligations (other than obligations which survive as provided in the following sentence) have been paid and satisfied in full. The indemnities to which
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are entitled under the provisions of Sections 3.11., 4.1., 4.4., 11.7., 12.2. and 12.10. and any other provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the provisions of Section 12.5.,
shall continue in full force and effect and shall protect the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (i) notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, or of the other Loan Documents, against events arising after such termination as well as
before and (ii) at all times after any such party ceases to be a party to this Agreement with respect to all matters and events existing on or prior to the date such party ceased to be a party to this Agreement. 
Section 12.12.  Severability of Provisions. 
If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severed from the Loan Documents, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall remain in full force as though the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable
provision had never been part of the Loan Documents.

specified herein shall be absolute and not subject to any defense the Borrower may have that the Borrower does not control such Loan Parties.

All covenants hereunder shall be given in any jurisdiction independent effect so that if a particular action or condition
is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken
or condition exists.  Section 12.17.  Limitation of Liability. 
None of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or any Affiliate, officer, director, employee, attorney, or agent of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have any liability with respect to, and the Borrower hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to sue any of them upon, any claim for any special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages suffered or
