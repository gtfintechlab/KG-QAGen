Borrower to a Designated Subsidiary, as applicable, as contemplated by the applicable Sale Agreement be, and be treated for all purposes as, a sale by the Equityholder or the Borrower, as applicable, of such Warehouse Assets. It is, further, not the
intention of the parties that such conveyance be deemed a pledge of the Warehouse Assets by the Equityholder or Borrower, as applicable, to the Borrower or a Designated Subsidiary, as applicable, to secure a debt or other obligation of the
Equityholder or the Borrower, as applicable. However, in the event that, notwithstanding the intent of the parties, the Warehouse Assets are held to continue to be property of the Equityholder or the Borrower, as applicable, then the parties hereto
agree that: (i) the applicable Sale Agreement shall also be deemed to be a security agreement under applicable law; (ii) as set forth in such Sale Agreement, the transfer of the Warehouse Assets provided for in such Sale Agreement shall be
deemed to be a grant by the Equityholder or the Borrower, as applicable, to the Borrower or the applicable Designated Subsidiary of a first priority security interest in all of the Equityholders or Borrowers, as applicable, right, title
and interest in and to the Warehouse Assets and all amounts payable to the holders of the Warehouse Assets in accordance with the terms thereof and all proceeds of the conversion, voluntary or involuntary, of the foregoing into cash, instruments,
securities or other property, including, all amounts from time to time held or invested in the Accounts, whether in the form of cash, instruments, securities or other property; (iii) the possession by a Borrower Party of Warehouse Assets and
such other items of property as constitute instruments, money, negotiable documents or chattel paper shall be, subject to <u>clause (iv)</u> below, for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to the UCC; and
(iv) acknowledgements from Persons holding such property shall be deemed acknowledgements from custodians, bailees or agents (as applicable) of the applicable Borrower Party for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under applicable
law. The parties further agree that any assignment of the interest of a Borrower Party pursuant to any provision hereof shall also be deemed to be an assignment of any security interest created pursuant to the terms of the applicable Sale Agreement.
Each Borrower Party shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement and the other Collateral Documents, take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that, if a Sale Agreement was deemed to create a security interest in the Warehouse Assets,
such security interest would be deemed to be a perfected security interest of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained as such throughout the term of this Agreement. </p>

a Designated Subsidiary, as applicable, pursuant to a Sale Agreement shall constitute assets owned by the Borrower or such Designated Subsidiary, as applicable, and shall not be part of the Equityholders or Borrowers, as applicable,
estate in the event of the filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against the Equityholder or Borrower, as applicable, under any bankruptcy or similar law. </p>
