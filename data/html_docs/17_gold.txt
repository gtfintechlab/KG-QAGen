Thereafter, the Borrower may elect, in the case of any Borrowing to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.05.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated on a pro rata basis among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.  (b)    Each interest election pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be made upon the Borrower’s irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by “pdf” or similar electronic format, in the form of a written Interest Election Request signed by the Borrower.(c)    Each written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:(i)    the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);(ii)    the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;(iii)    whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an Base Rate Borrowing or a LIBOR Borrowing; and(iv)    if the resulting Borrowing is a LIBOR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election.If any such Interest Election Request made by the Borrower requests a LIBOR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of three (3) months’ duration.(d)    Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender to which such Interest Election Request relates of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.(e)    If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a LIBOR Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, the Borrower shall be deemed to have converted such Borrowing to a LIBOR Borrowing with an Interest Period of three (3) months’ duration at the end of such Interest Period.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then, so long as such Event of Default is continuing, (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a LIBOR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each LIBOR Borrowing shall be converted to a Base Rate Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.  Section 2.06    Termination of Commitments.  Any undrawn Commitments will terminate at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Closing Date.Section 2.07    Evidence of Debt. (a)    Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.  (b)    The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period (if any) applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) any amount received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.(c)    The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.07 shall be prima facie evidence absent manifest error of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligations of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, further, that in the event of any conflict between the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.07, the entries made in the Register shall control.(d)    Any Lender may request that Loans made by it to the Borrower be evidenced by a Note.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns).  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including, to the extent requested by any assignee, after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the payee named therein (or to such payee and its registered assigns).Section 2.08    Repayment of Loans; Application of Prepayments.   (a)    The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan made to the Borrower on such dates and in such amounts as provided in this Section 2.08. Subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 2.08, (i) the Borrower shall repay on each Quarterly Date an aggregate principal amount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Loans drawn on the Closing Date (each a “Scheduled Amortization Payment”) and (ii) the Borrower shall repay on the Maturity Date all remaining amounts of the Loans then outstanding.  All payments under this Section 2.08(a) shall be allocated to the Lenders on a pro rata basis.  For the avoidance of doubt, no Default or Event of Default shall arise solely as a result of the outstanding principal amount of the Loans exceeding the scheduled Target Loan Balance for any ECF Sweep Date after giving effect to any prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.09(c) for such ECF Sweep Date.(b)    To the extent not previously paid, all Loans shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date. (c)    Prepayment of the Loans (i) pursuant to Section 2.09(b), shall be applied to Scheduled Amortization Payments and the remaining unpaid principal amount of Loans due and payable on the Maturity Date in the inverse order of maturity, (ii) pursuant to Section 2.09(c), shall be applied, first, in direct order of maturity to all Scheduled Amortization Payments in respect of the Loans due on the immediately succeeding four (4) Quarterly Dates from the date of such prepayment, second, to the remaining Scheduled Amortization Payments in respect of the Loans and the remaining unpaid principal amount of Loans due and payable on the Maturity Date in the inverse order of maturity, and (iii) from any optional prepayments pursuant to Section 2.09(a) shall be applied to the remaining Scheduled Amortization Payments in respect of the Loans as directed by the Borrower and thereafter to the remaining unpaid principal amount of Loans due and payable on the Maturity Date, and all such payments pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall be allocated ratably to the Lenders.(d)    Prior to any repayment of any Borrowing hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by “pdf” or similar electronic format, in the form of a written Prepayment Notice signed by the Borrower.  Such Prepayment Notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) (i) in the case of an Base Rate Borrowing, one (1) Business Day before the scheduled date of such repayment and (ii) in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing, three (3) Business Days before the scheduled date of such repayment.  Each repayment of a Borrowing shall be allocated ratably to the Loans included in the repaid Borrowing.  Section 2.09    Optional and Mandatory Prepayment of Loans. (a)    The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay Loans in whole or in part (but subject to Section 2.14 and Section 2.09(d)), in an aggregate principal amount that is an integral multiple of U.S. $1.0 million and not less than U.S. $1.0 million or, if less, the amount outstanding, subject to prior notice in the form of Exhibit B hereto provided in accordance with Section 2.08(d). (b)    The Borrower shall apply Net Proceeds promptly upon (and in any event within three (3) Business Days of) receipt thereof by any of the Loan Parties as follows (i) with respect to Net Proceeds from the AG Disposition, AVSR Disposition and SolGen Disposition (A) Net Proceeds in an amount up to the applicable Target Sale Prepayment Amount and (B) 50% of the amount of Net Proceeds in excess of such applicable Target Sale Prepayment Amount (the “Target Sale Additional Prepayment Amount”), if any, shall be applied to prepay Loans in accordance with Section 2.08(c) and (ii) all other Net Proceeds shall be applied to prepay Loans made to the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.08(c); provided that, any amount of Net Proceeds from the AG Disposition, AVSR Disposition or SolGen Disposition (if any), in excess of the Target Sale Prepayment Amount and, if applicable, any Target Sale Additional Prepayment Amount (“Excess Project Disposition Proceeds”) shall not be subject to this Section 2.09(b) and may be deposited in the Equity Proceeds Account and transferred in accordance with Section 2.19(g).(c)    On the date that is five (5) Business Days after the Quarterly Date occurring in May of each year (the “ECF Sweep Date”), the Borrower shall apply all amounts on deposit in the ECF Prepayment Account (after giving effect to transfers of Excess Cash Flow pursuant to Section 2.19(c)(vii) on such Quarterly Date) to prepay the Loans in accordance with Section 2.08(c), in each case as calculated and certified by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.04(e).(d)    In the event that a Repricing Event is consummated in connection with all or any portion of the Loans on or prior to the period ending six months from the Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay to the Lenders a non-refundable fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Loans prepaid, converted or assigned in connection with such Repricing Event.Section 2.10    Fees.  (a)    The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Administrative Agent, the administrative fees set forth in the applicable Fee Letter at the times specified therein (the “Administrative Agent Fees”). (b)    The Borrower shall pay to the Collateral Agent, for the account of the Collateral Agent, and to the Depositary Bank, for the account of the Depositary Bank, the fees and other amounts set forth in the Fee Letters between the Borrower and the Collateral Agent and Depositary Bank (including attorneys’ fees and expenses), respectively, at the times specified therein.  (c)    The Borrower agrees to pay on the Closing Date such fees as are set forth in the Engagement Letter and the Fee Letters and expressly provided therein as being due and payable on the Closing Date (which fees shall be non-refundable and non-creditable thereafter).  (d)    All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate, among the Lenders.  Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.Section 2.11    Interest.   (a)    The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Base Rate Loan made to the Borrower at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. (b)    The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each LIBOR Loan made to the Borrower at the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such LIBOR Loan plus the Applicable Margin.(c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any Fees or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, then the Borrower shall pay interest on such overdue amount, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2.00% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 2.11 or (y) in the case of any other amount, 2.00% plus the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.11.(d)    Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable by the Borrower from and after the Closing Date in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan, and on the Maturity Date; provided that (x) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 2.11 shall be payable on demand, (y) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an Base Rate Loan prior to its stated maturity (unless all Loans are being repaid)), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (z) in the event of any conversion of any LIBOR Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.  (e)    All computations of interest shall be made by the Administrative Agent taking into account the actual number of days occurring in the period for which such interest is payable (including the first day but excluding the last day) pursuant to this Section 2.11, and (i) if based on the Base Rate as calculated based on the Prime Rate, a year of 365 days or 366 days, as the case may be; or (ii) if based on the Base Rate (other than as calculated based on the Prime Rate) or the LIBO Rate, on the basis of a year of 360 days.Section 2.12    Alternate Rate of Interest.  (a)    If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBOR Borrowing:(i)    the Administrative Agent determines in good faith that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or(ii)    the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (acting in good faith) that the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;then the Administrative Agent shall give written notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (x) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a LIBOR Borrowing shall be ineffective and such Borrowing shall be converted to an Base Rate Borrowing on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, and (y) if any Borrowing Request requests a LIBOR Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an Base Rate Borrowing.(b)    If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent reasonably determine in good faith that an interest rate is not ascertainable pursuant to the provisions of the definition of “LIBO Base Rate” and the inability to ascertain such rate is unlikely to be temporary, the “LIBO Base Rate” shall be an alternate rate of interest established by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that is commercially practicable for the Administrative Agent to administer (as determined by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion) and is generally accepted as the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest (including the making of appropriate adjustments to such alternate rate and this Agreement (x) to preserve pricing in effect at the time of selection of such alternate rate (but for the avoidance of doubt which shall not be at an interest rate less than the LIBO Base Rate prior to the adoption of the alternate rate) and (y) other changes necessary to reflect the available interest periods for such alternate rate) for syndicated leveraged loans of this type in the United States at such time (any such rate, the “Successor Benchmark Rate”), and the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate rate of interest and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be applicable and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 9.08, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided, that if a Successor Benchmark Rate has not been established pursuant to the foregoing, at the option of the Borrower, the Borrower and the Required Lenders (as defined below) may select a different Successor Benchmark Rate that is reasonably commercially practicable for the Administrative Agent to administer (as determined by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion) and, upon not less than 15 Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders and the Borrower shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate rate of interest and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be applicable and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 9.08, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided, further, that until such Successor Benchmark Rate has been determined pursuant to this paragraph, (i) any request for Borrowing, the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a LIBOR Loan shall be ineffective and (ii) all outstanding Borrowings shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan.Section 2.13    Increased Costs.   (a)    If any Change in Law shall:(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by or participated in by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the LIBO Rate); or(ii)    impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or participation therein (including any Tax, cost or expense) (except, in each case, for (x) Indemnified Taxes indemnified pursuant to Section 2.15, (y) Excluded Taxes and (z) Other Taxes);and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) to the Borrower or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered in connection therewith.(b)    If any Lender reasonably determines in good faith that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or any of the Loans made by such Lender or as a consequence of the Commitments to make any of the foregoing, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered in connection therewith.(c)    A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as applicable, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.13 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.(d)    Promptly after any Lender has determined that it will make a request for increased compensation pursuant to this Section 2.13, such Lender shall notify the Borrower thereof.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.Section 2.14    Break Funding Payments.  In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any LIBOR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any LIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBOR Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto or (d) the assignment of any LIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.17, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event.  Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to be the amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such LIBOR Loan had such event not occurred, at the LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue a LIBOR Loan, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in U.S. Dollars of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.Section 2.15    Taxes. (a)    Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, except to the extent required by applicable law.  If any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes are required by applicable law to be deducted from any such payments, then (i) the sum payable by the Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15), each Agent or Lender, as applicable, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions for Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes been made, (ii) such Loan Party or the applicable withholding agent, if required to deduct any such Taxes, shall make such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party or the applic

    In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.(c)    The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Agent and each Lender, within ten (10) days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent or such Lender, as applicable, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Loan Parties under any Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.15) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority; provided that a certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation for such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or Agent, shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable.(d)    As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.(e)    Each Lender that is not a “United States person” as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a “Non-U.S. Lender”) shall, to the extent it may lawfully do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two executed originals of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (claiming the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty), W-8EXP, W-8IMY (together with any required attachments) or Form W-8ECI, or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of “portfolio interest,” a statement substantially in the form of Exhibit I and a Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender (with any other required forms attached) claiming complete exemption from or a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Each Lender that is not a Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it may lawfully do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two executed originals of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, claiming complete exemption (or otherwise establishing an exemption) from U.S. backup withholding on all payments under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Such forms shall be delivered by each Lender, to the extent it may lawfully do so, on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement.  In addition, each Lender, to the extent it may lawfully do so, shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or inaccuracy of any form previously delivered by such Lender.  Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose).  Without limiting the foregoing, any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax otherwise indemnified against by a Loan Party pursuant to this Section 2.15 with respect to payments under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower or the relevant Governmental Authority (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), to the extent such Lender is legally entitled to do so, at the time or times prescribed by applicable law such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to permit such payments to be made without such withholding tax or at a reduced rate; provided that in such Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice such Lender. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; provided that in such Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice such Lender. (f)    If an Agent or a Lender determines, in good faith and in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.15, it shall pay over such refund to such Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 2.15 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Agent or such Lender (including any Taxes imposed with respect to such refund) as is determined by such Agent or such Lender in

 its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the Loan Parties or any other Person.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event shall any Agent or Lender be required to pay any amount to any Loan Party pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place such Agent or Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than it would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification, or with respect to which additional amounts were paid, and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to the Tax had never been paid.(g)    If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this paragraph (g), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.(h)    Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to Section 2.15(e) or 2.15(g) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.  (i)    For purposes of this Section 2.15, the term “applicable law” shall include FATCA. Section 2.16    Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.   (a)    Unless otherwise specified, the Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 p.m. (New York City time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without condition or deduction for any defense, recoupment, set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable account designated to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.05 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Loan or of other amounts due hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made in U.S. Dollars.  Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.(b)    If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent from the Borrower to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due from the Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.(c)    If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim, through the application of any proceeds of Collateral or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant permitted pursuant to Section 9.04.  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent they may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.(d)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment by the Borrower is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, as applicable, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.(e)    If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(b) or 2.16(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.Section 2.17    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  (a)    (x) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, (y) if any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or (z) if any Lender exercises its rights under Section 2.18, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15, as applicable, in the future, or would eliminate such Lender’s need to exercise its rights under Section 2.18, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.(b)    If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender exercises its rights under Section 2.18, then the Borrower may, at the Borrower’s sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments.  Nothing in this Section 2.17 shall be deemed to prejudice any rights that any Loan Party may have against any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender.  (c)    If any Lender (such Lender, a “Non-Consenting Lender”) has failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, consent, discharge or termination which pursuant to the terms of Section 9.08 requires the consent of all of the Lenders affected or all of the Lenders and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have granted their consent, then provided no Event of Default then exists, the Borrower shall have the right (unless such Non-Consenting Lender grants such consent) to replace such Non-Consenting Lender by requiring such Non-Consenting Lender to assign its Loans and its Commitments hereunder to one or more assignees reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent; provided that, (i) all Obligations of the Borrower due and payable to such Non-Consenting Lender being replaced shall be paid in full to such Non-Consenting Lender concurrently with such assignment, (including any such Obligation pursuant to Section 2.09(d)), (ii) the replacement Lender shall purchase the foregoing by paying to such Non-Consenting Lender a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and (iii) the replacement Lender shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver, consent, discharge or termination or provides such consent concurrently with such assignment.  In connection with any such assignment the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, such Non-Consenting Lender and the replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with Section 9.04.  Each Lender agrees that if the Borrower exercises the Borrower’s option hereunder to cause an assignment by such Lender as a Non-Consenting Lender, such Lender shall, promptly after receipt of written notice of such election, execute and deliver all documentation necessary to effectuate such assignment in accordance with Section 9.04.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that a Lender does not comply with the requirements of the immediately preceding sentence within one (1) Business Day after receipt of such notice, such assignment shall be deemed to have occurred on such Business Day without such Lender’s execution and delivery of any documentation required pursuant to Section 9.04.(d)    A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation under this Section 2.17, if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment cease to apply.Section 2.18    Illegality.  If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make or maintain any LIBOR Loans, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligations of such Lender to make or continue LIBOR Loans or to convert Base Rate Borrowings to LIBOR Borrowings, as the case may be, shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), convert all such LIBOR Borrowings of such Lender to Base Rate Borrowings on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Borrowings to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Loans.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.Section 2.19    Depositary Accounts.          (a)    Establishment of Accounts.  On or prior to the Closing Date, the Borrower shall establish the following deposit accounts (the “Depositary Accounts”), with the Depositary Bank, in each case, subject to fully perfected first priority security interest and Control Agreement in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties to secure the Obligations: (i)    a U.S. Dollar-denominated account in the name of the Borrower entitled “ExGen Renewables IV – Revenue” and numbered [***] (the “Revenue Account”); (ii)    a U.S. Dollar-denominated account in the name of the Borrower entitled “ExGen Renewables IV – Equity Proceeds” and numbered [***]  (the “Equity Proceeds Account”); (iii)    a U.S. Dollar-denominated account in the name of the Borrower entitled “ExGen Renewables IV – Debt Service Reserve” and numbered [***] (the “Debt Service Reserve Account”); (iv)    a U.S. Dollar-denominated account in the name of the Borrower entitled “ExGen Renewables IV – Liquidity Reserve” and numbered [***] (the “Liquidity Reserve Account”); and(v)    a U.S. Dollar-denominated account in the name of the Borrower entitled “ExGen Renewables IV – ECF Prepayment” and numbered [***] (the “ECF Prepayment Account”).All amounts on deposit in or credited to each Depositary Account from time to time shall (i) be disbursed in accordance with the terms hereof, (ii) constitute the property of the Borrower, (iii) be subject to the first priority Lien of the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties), (iv) be held in the sole custody and “control” (within the meaning of Section 8-106(d) or Section 9-104 of the UCC) of the Collateral Agent for the purposes and on the terms set forth in this Agreement and the Security Documents and (v) constitute a part of the Collateral.  No amounts on deposit in or credited to the Depositary Accounts from time to time shall constitute payment of any Obligations or any other obligation of any Loan Party.(b)    Deposits into Accounts.(i)    Revenue Account. All Cash and Cash Equivalents (including all Available Cash and any proceeds received by the Loan Parties as a result of the exercise of Cure Rights pursuant to Section 7.02) of each of the Loan Parties, all amounts required to be transferred to the Revenue Account from any other Depositary Accounts in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and all other amounts received by the Loan Parties on or after the Closing Date and not required to be deposited to another Depositary Account pursuant to this Agreement shall be deposited as and when received (without regard to whether the current fiscal period in which they arise has closed) directly to, and shall be retained in, the Revenue Account, subject to application in accordance with Section 2.19(c), other than Cash and Cash Equivalents (A) required to be deposited (or on deposit) in the Debt Service Reserve Account pursuant to Section 2.19(d), (B) deposited (or on deposit) in the Liquidity Reserve Account pursuant to Section 2.19(e) and (C) any Equity Proceeds, Completion Proceeds and any Excess Project Disposition Proceeds deposited in the Equity Proceeds Account.

(B)    So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower shall be entitled to instruct the Depositary Bank to release funds from the Debt Service Reserve Account pursuant to a written request from a Responsible Officer of the Borrower (certifying as to no Event of Default), with a copy to the Administrative Agent, in the event that the Borrower has provided to the Collateral Agent a Sponsor Guaranty or an Account Letter of Credit in a guaranteed or stated amount equal to the amount of funds to be released from the Debt Service Reserve Account and amounts so released shall be transferred to such accounts or Persons as are specified in such instructions to the Depositary Bank.  Such Sponsor Guaranty and Account Letter of Credit shall be subject to all of the terms of this Section 2.19(d). (C)    The Borrower may at any time deliver Cash and Cash Equivalents and/or one or more Account Letters of Credit to the Depositary Agent for deposit in or credit to the Debt Service Reserve Account and upon delivery thereof, shall be entitled, (pursuant to a written request from a Responsible Officer of the Borrower to the applicable guarantor and the Collateral Agent, certifying that such reduction is in compliance with this clause (C), with a copy to the Administrative Agent) to a reduction in the then available guaranteed amount under any Sponsor Guaranty credited to the Debt Service Reserve Account pursuant to a supplement provided under such Sponsor Guaranty or documentation otherwise satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in the face or stated amount equal to the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents and/or Account Letters of Credit to be deposited in or credited to the Debt Service Reserve Account.  Any such reduction shall only be effective upon actual receipt by the Depositary Agent of the replacement Cash and Cash Equivalents and/or one or more Account Letters of Credit.(D)    For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the guaranteed amount of any Sponsor Guaranty or the stated amount of any Account Letter of Credit credited to the Debt Service Reserve Account be permitted to be reduced other than in connection with Section 2.19(d)(iii)(A) or 2.19(d)(iii)(C) or in connection with a cash payment made pursuant to any demand or draw, as applicable, thereunder paid to the Collateral Agent  in accordance with the terms thereof.(iv)    Disbursements to Pay Debt Service.

In the event that any Loan Party conveys, sells, leases, assigns, transfers or otherwise disposes of all or any portion of its assets (including the Equity Interests of any of its Subsidiaries) to a Person that is not (and is not required to become) a Loan Party in a transaction not prohibited by the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall promptly (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to) take such action and execute any such documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower and at the Borrower’s expense to release any Liens created by any Loan Document in respect of such Equity Interests or assets that are the subject of such disposition.  Any representation, warranty or covenant contained in any Loan Document relating to any such Equity Interests or assets shall no longer be deemed to be made once such Equity Interests or assets are so conveyed, sold, leased, assigned, transferred or disposed of.

tion of any term of any Loan Document to the extent necessary to give effect to any Bail-In Action in relation to any such liability.Section 9.20    U.S.A. PATRIOT Act and Similar Legislation.  Each Agent and each Lender hereby notifies each Loan Party that pursuant to the requirements of the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act and similar legislation, as applicable, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Loan Parties, which information includes the name and address of each Loan Party and other information that will allow the Agents and the Lenders to identify such Loan Party in accordance with such legislation.  Each Loan Party agrees to furnish such information promptly upon its receipt of a written request therefor from an Agent or a Lender. Section 9.21    No Fiduciary Duty.  Each Agent, each Lender and their respective Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this Section 9.21, the “Lenders”), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties.  Each of Holding and the Borrower hereby agrees, on behalf of itself and the other Loan Parties, that subject to applicable law, nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between the Lenders and the Loan Parties, their equity-holders or their Affiliates.  Each of Holding and the Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and the other Loan Parties, that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents are arm's-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction none of the Lenders is acting as the agent or fiduciary of any Loan Party, its management, equity-holders, creditors or any other person, (iii) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Loan Party with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender or any of its Affiliates has advised or is currently advising such Loan Party on other matters) or any other obligation to any Loan Party except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, (iv) each of the Borrower and each other Loan Party has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, (v) the Lenders may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates and no Lender has an obligation to disclose any such interests to the Borrower or its Affiliates and (vi) it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to it in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto, and agrees that each  Lender shall have no liability (whether direct or indirect) in respect to such a claim or to any other Person asserting such a claim on their behalf.  Each of Holding and the Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto.  Section 9.22     Affiliated Lenders.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, with respect to any Loans at any time held by an Affiliated Lender, such Affiliated Lender shall have no right whatsoever, in its capacity as a Lender with respect to such Loans then held by such Affiliated Lender, whether or not any Loan Party is subject to a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding or otherwise, so long as such Lender is an Affiliated Lender, to (i) consent to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other such action with respect to, or otherwise vote on any matter related to, or vote in connection with any direction delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent by the Required Lenders pursuant to, any of the terms of the Agreement or any other Loan Document, in each case to the extent such amendment, modification, waiver, consent, other action, vote or direction is effective with only the consent of or action by the Required Lenders (each, a “Required Lender Vote/Directive”) and, if applicable, the Borrower or any other Loan Party; provided that for purposes of any Required Lender Vote/Directive, the Administrative Agent shall automatically deem any Loans held by such Affiliated Lender to be voted on a pro rata basis in accordance with the votes cast in respect of the Loans of all other Lenders in the aggregate (other than any Affiliated Lender) in connection with any such Required Lender Vote/Directive (including all voting and consent rights arising out of any bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings (except for voting on any plan of reorganization or refraining from voting on any plan of reorganization, in which case the Administrative Agent shall vote or refrain from voting such Loans of such Affiliated Lender in the Administrative Agent’s sole discretion)); provided, further, that no such Required Lender Vote/Directive shall deprive such Affiliated Lender of its share of any payments or other recoveries which the Lenders are entitled to share on a pro rata basis under the Loan Documents and such Affiliated Lender’s vote shall be counted to the extent any such plan of reorganization or other amendment proposes to treat the Obligations of the Affiliated Lender in a manner less favorable in any material respect to such Affiliated Lender than the proposed treatment of Obligations held by Lenders that are not Affiliates of the Borrower, (ii) attend any meeting (live or by any electronic means) in such Affiliated Lender’s capacity as a Lender with any Agent or other Lender or receive any information from any Agent or other Lender except to the extent such information is made available to any Loan Party (or its representatives) and other than administrative notices given to all Lenders under Article II or (iii) have access to the Platform in such Affiliated Lender’s capacity as a Lender.

(ii)    Voting and Distributions.(A)    So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and until such time as the Grantor shall have received notice from the Collateral Agent pursuant to clause (B) below:(1)    the Grantor shall be entitled to exercise or refrain from exercising any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Investment Related Property constituting Collateral or any part thereof; provided, however, that no vote with respect to the Investment Related Property shall be cast (or refrained from being cast), right exercised (or refrained from being exercised) or other action taken (or refrained from being taken) which would be inconsistent with, or result in any violation of, any provision of any of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (2)    the Collateral Agent shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to the Grantor all proxies, and other instruments as the Grantor, at its sole cost and expense, may from time to time reasonably request for the purpose of enabling the Grantor to exercise the voting and other consensual rights when and to the extent which it is entitled to exercise pursuant to clause (1) above; and(3)    the Grantor shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all dividends, interest and other distributions paid in respect of any Investment Related Property for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or the Loan Documents.  To the extent that such distributions are made in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, the further distribution or payment of such monies to a Person which is not the Grantor shall not give rise to any claims or causes of action on the part of any Secured Party against the Grantor seeking the return or disgorgement of any such distributions or other payments unless the distributions or payments involve or result from fraud or willful misconduct of the Grantor.(B)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default and upon delivery of written notice of the occurrence and continuation of such Event of Default from the Collateral Agent to the Grantor (it being acknowledged and agreed that the Collateral Agent shall not be required to deliver any such notice if the Grantor is the subject of a Bankruptcy Event):  (1)    all rights of the Grantor to receive the dividends, interest and other distributions that it would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to Section 5.4(a)(ii)(A)(3) shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent who shall thereupon have the sole right to receive and hold as Investment Related Property such dividends, interest and other distributions; (2)    in order to permit the Collateral Agent to exercise the voting and other consensual rights which it may be entitled to exercise pursuant hereto and to receive all dividends and other distributions which it may be entitled to receive hereunder, in each case, in respect of Investment Related Property constituting Collateral:  (x) the Grantor shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to the Collateral Agent, at its sole cost and expense, all proxies, dividend payment orders and other instruments as the Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request and (y) the Grantor acknowledges that the Collateral Agent may utilize the power of attorney set forth in Section 7.1; and(3)    the Grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer of any Investment Related Property pledged by the Grantor hereunder to comply with any instruction received by it from the Collateral Agent in writing that (x) states that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (y) is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or further instructions from the Grantor.(b)    Pledged Equity Interests and Pledged Notes.(i)    Representations and Warranties.  The Grantor hereby represents and warrants, on the Closing Date, that:(A)    Schedule 4.4(a) sets forth under the heading “Pledged Equity Interests” all of the Pledged Equity Interests owned by the Grantor, and such Pledged Equity Interests constitute the percentage of issued and outstanding Equity Interests or percentage of beneficial interest of the respective Issuers thereof indicated on such Schedule 4.4(a); and(B)    Schedule 4.4(b) sets forth under the heading “Pledged Notes” all of the Pledged Notes owned by the Grantor; and (C)    each of the Pledged Equity Interests that is pledged by the Grantor hereunder is certificated as indicated on Schedule 4.4(a) and constitutes a “security” under Section 8-103 of the UCC or the corresponding code or statute of any other applicable jurisdiction and each such “security” is a Certificated Security or is represented by a certificate.(ii)    Covenants and Agreements.  (A) Pledged Equity Interests. The Grantor hereby covenants and agrees that, if the Grantor shall become entitled to receive or shall receive any certificate (including, without limitation, any certificate representing a dividend or a distribution in connection with any reclassification, increase or reduction of capital or any certificate issued in connection with any reorganization), option or rights in respect of the Equity Interests of any Issuer (including, without limitation, any Additional Project Entity), whether in addition to, in substitution of, as a conversion of, or in exchange for, any shares of the Pledged Equity Interests, or otherwise in respect thereof, the Grantor shall accept the same as the agent of the Collateral Agent, hold the same in trust for the Collateral Agent and deliver the same forthwith to the Collateral Agent in the exact form received, duly indorsed by the Grantor to the Collateral Agent, if required, together with an undated stock power covering such certificate duly executed in blank by the Grantor and with, if the Collateral Agent so requests, signature guaranteed, to be held by the Collateral Agent, subject to the terms hereof, as additional collateral security for the Obligations, and in the case Equity Interests in Additional Project Entities, a consent from the Issuer thereof substantially in the form of Exhibit C.  Unless otherwise consented to by the Collateral Agent, Pledged Equity Interests required to be pledged hereunder in any Subsidiary that is organized as a limited liability company or limited partnership and pledged hereunder shall be represented by a certificate and, in the Organizational Documents of such Subsidiary, the Grantor shall cause the Issuer of such interests to elect to treat such interests as a “security” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code of its jurisdiction of organization (and all certificates representing such Pledged Equity Interests (and any additional Pledged Equity Interests acquired or issued after the Closing Date) shall have been delivered to the Collateral Agent, together with duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank). (B) Pledged Notes.  If the Grantor shall at any time hold or acquire any Instruments, the Grantor shall forthwith endorse, assign and deliver the same to the Collateral Agent, accompanied by such undated instruments of endorsement, transfer or assignment duly executed in blank as the Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably specify; provided that the Collateral Agent shall return any such Instruments for purposes of presentation, collection, renewal or replacement. The Grantor agrees to promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to the Collateral Agent any and all Pledged Notes held or acquired by the Grantor, accompanied by proper instruments  of assignment duly executed by the Grantor and such other instruments or documents as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request; provided that the Collateral Agent shall return any such Pledged Note to the Borrower (x) to be amended or assigned in connection with a permitted disposition (including the AG Disposition) under the Credit Agreement to the extent required to facilitate such disposition so long as the Borrower delivers any replacement Pledged Note, if any, held by the Borrower after consummation of such disposition or (y) for purposes of presentation, collection, renewal or replacement.5.5    Assigned Agreements.  The Grantor hereby covenants and agrees that, in addition to any rights under Section 5.3, the Collateral Agent may at any time, after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, notify, or direct the Grantor to notify, the counterparty on any Assigned Agreement of the security interest of the Collateral Agent therein.  In addition, after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may upon written notice to the Grantor, notify, or direct the Grantor to notify, the counterparty that all payments under the Assigned Agreements shall be made directly to the Collateral Agent.5.6    Letter of Credit Rights(a)    Representations and Warranties.  The Grantor hereby represents and warrants, on the Closing Date, that, to the knowledge of the Grantor, the Grantor does not have rights as beneficiary in any letter of credit constituting Collateral.(b)    Covenants and Agreements. (i)    The Grantor hereby covenants and agrees that with respect to any letter of credit constituting Collateral with a stated amount in excess of $[***] hereafter arising it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) obtain the consent of the issuer thereof to the assignment of the proceeds of the letter of credit to the Collateral Agent and (y) deliver to the Collateral Agent a completed Pledge Supplement, together with all Supplements to Schedules thereto.(ii)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Grantor will, promptly upon request by the Collateral Agent, (x) notify (and the Grantor hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to notify) the issuer and each nominated person with respect to any Supporting Obligations consisting of letters of credit of which the Grantor is the beneficiary that the proceeds thereof have been assigned to the Collateral Agent hereunder and any payments due or to become due in respect thereof are to be made directly to the Collateral Agent or its designee and (y) arrange for the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties to become the transferee beneficiary of any such letter of credit.5.7    Intellectual Property(a)    Non-Exclusive License.  For the purpose of enabling the Collateral Agent to exercise rights and remedies under Section 8, the Grantor hereby grants to the Collateral Agent, to the extent assignable, an irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use, assign, license or sublicense any Intellectual Property included in the Collateral now owned or hereafter acquired by the Grantor, wherever the same may be located, including in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer programs used for the compilation or printout thereof.(b)    Use of Intellectual Property.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, but subject to the provisions of the Loan Documents that limit the rights of the Grantor to dispose of its Intellectual Property, so long as no instruction by the Collateral Agent acting at the direction of the Secured Parties has been delivered in connection with the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, the Grantor may exploit, use, enjoy, protect, license sublicense, assign, sell, dispose of or take other actions with respect to the Intellectual Property in the ordinary course of the business of the Grantor.  In furtherance of the foregoing, so long as no such instruction has been delivered in connection with the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent shall from time to time, upon the request and at the expense of the Grantor, execute and deliver any instruments, certificates or other documents, in the form so requested, that the Grantor shall have certified are appropriate (in its judgment) to allow it to take any action permitted above (including relinquishment of the license provided pursuant to clause (a) immediately above as to any specific Intellectual Property constituting Collateral).  Further, upon the release of the Liens on the Collateral in accordance with the terms of Section 9.18 of the Credit Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall transfer to the Grantor the license granted pursuant to clause (a) immediately above.  The exercise of rights and remedies under Section 8 by the Collateral Agent shall not terminate the rights of the holders of any licenses or sublicenses theretofore granted by the Grantor in accordance with the first sentence of this clause (b).(c)    Events of Default.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Grantor shall, upon the request of the Collateral Agent, deliver to the Collateral Agent a schedule listing all Intellectual Property constituting Collateral and take such other action as the Collateral Agent shall deem necessary to perfect the Liens created hereunder in all such Collateral.5.8    Commercial Tort Claims.  If the Grantor shall at any time acquire a Commercial Tort Claim with potential value in excess of excess of $[***], the Grantor shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to, within 60 days of obtaining such Commercial Tort Claim, deliver to the Collateral Agent a completed Pledge Supplement, together with all Supplements to Schedules thereto, identifying such new Commercial Tort Claims, and such other documentation acceptable to the Collateral Agent to grant a security interest under the terms and provisions of this Agreement in and to such Commercial Tort Claim.SECTION 6.    FURTHER ASSURANCES.6.1    Further Assurances(a)    The Grantor agrees that from time to time, at the sole cost and expense of the Grantor, that, upon its receipt of a written request therefor from the Collateral Agent, it shall promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents, and take all further action, that may be necessary in order to (x) create and/or maintain the validity and perfection of and otherwise protect any security interest in Collateral granted hereby or (y) enable the Collateral Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to any Collateral.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Grantor shall maintain the Liens created by this Agreement as a perfected security interest prior and superior in right to any other Person except Liens permitted under the Loan Documents, and, upon the reasonable written request of the Collateral Agent, execute and deliver such other agreements, instruments, endorsements, powers of attorney or notices as are necessary, or as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, to grant, preserve, protect, reflect and perfect the security interests granted or purported to be granted hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall require the Collateral Agent to file financing statements or continuation statements, or be responsible for maintaining the security interests purported to be created as described herein (except for the safe custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document) and such responsibility shall be solely that of the Borrower.(b)    The Grantor hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to file a Record or Records, including, without limitation, financing or continuation statements, intellectual property security agreements and amendments thereto, in any jurisdictions and with any filing offices as the Collateral Agent may reasonably determine, are necessary or advisable to perfect the security interest granted to the Collateral Agent herein.  Such financing statements may describe the Collateral in the same manner as described herein or may contain an indication or description of collateral that describes such property in any other manner as the Collateral Agent may reasonably determine, are necessary, advisable or prudent to ensure the perfection of the security interest in the Collateral granted to the Collateral Agent herein, including, without limitation, describing such property as “all assets” or “all personal property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired.”  The Collateral Agent shall have no responsibility for or liability with respect to monitoring the compliance of any other party to the Loan Documents, this Agreement or any other document related hereto or thereto.  The Collateral Agent has no duty to monitor the value or rating of any of the Collateral on an ongoing basis. The Grantor shall furnish to the Collateral Agent from time to time statements and schedules further identifying and describing the Collateral and such other reports in connection with the Collateral as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, all in reasonable detail; provided that, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent may not request updated schedules pursuant to this Section 6.1 from the Grantor more frequently than twice per calendar year.SECTION 7.    COLLATERAL AGENT APPOINTED ATTORNEY-IN-FACT7.1    Power of Attorney.  The Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Collateral Agent, acting for and on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties and each successor or assign of the Collateral Agent as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority in the place and stead of the Grantor and in the name of the Grantor or in its own name, at the Grantor’s sole cost and expense, subject to the terms of this Agreement and applicable Legal Requirements, to enforce all rights, interests and remedies of the Grantor with respect to the Collateral upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement, including the right to:(a)    ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, receive and give receipt and discharge for amounts due and to become due under and in respect of all or any part of the Collateral,(b)    in the name of the Grantor or its own name or otherwise, take possession of, receive and indorse and collect any check, Account, Chattel Paper, draft, note, acceptance or other Instrument for the payment of moneys due under any Account or general intangible, in each case, constituting Collateral,(c)    file any claims or take any other action that the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or advisable for the collection of all or any part of the Collateral,(d)    execute, in connection with any sale or disposition of the Collateral under this Agreement, any endorsements, assignments, bills of sale or other instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to all or any part of the Collateral,(e)    in the case of any Intellectual Property constituting Collateral, execute and deliver, and have recorded, any agreement, instrument, document or paper as the Collateral Agent may request to evidence the Collateral Agent’s security interest in such Intellectual Property and the goodwill and general intangibles of the Grantor relating thereto or represented thereby,(f)    pay or discharge Taxes and Liens levied or placed on or threatened against the Collateral (other than Liens permitted under the Credit Agreement), effect any repair or pay or discharge any insurance called for by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (including all or any part of the premiums therefor and the costs thereof),(g)    direct any party liable for any payment under any Collateral to make payment of any moneys due or to become due thereunder directly to the Collateral Agent or as the Collateral Agent shall direct, (h)    sign and indorse any invoice, freight or express bill, bill of lading, storage or warehouse receipt, draft against debtors, assignment, verification, notice or other document in connection with any Collateral,(i)    commence and prosecute any suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect any Collateral and to enforce any other right with respect to any Collateral,(j)    defend any suit, action or proceeding brought against the Grantor with respect to any Collateral, (k)    settle, compromise or adjust any such suit, action or proceeding with respect to any Collateral and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Collateral Agent may deem appropriate, (l)    assign any Copyright, Patent or Trademark (along with the goodwill of the business to which any such Trademark pertains) throughout the world for such term or terms, on such conditions and in such manner as the Collateral Agent shall in its sole discretion determine, including the execution and filing of any document necessary to effectuate or record such assignment,(m)    notify the counterparty on any Assigned Agreement of the security interest of the Collateral Agent therein and that all payments thereunder shall be made directly to the Collateral Agent and cure any default by the Grantor under any Assigned Agreement, and (n)    upon foreclosure, generally, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any Collateral as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do, at the Collateral Agent’s option and the Grantor’s expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things that the Collateral Agent reasonably deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the Collateral Agent’s and the other Secured Parties’ Liens thereon and to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as the Grantor might do.This appointment as attorney-in-fact is irrevocable and coupled with an interest.  7.2    No Duty on Part of Collateral Agent or Other Secured Parties.  The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder are solely to protect the interests of the Secured Parties in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to exercise any such powers.  The Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to the Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except in the case of their own gross negligence or willful misconduct, except in the case of their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.SECTION 8.    REMEDIES8.1    Generally.(a)    If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to all other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it at law or in equity, all the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent on default under the UCC (whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral) to collect, enforce or satisfy any Obligations then owing, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and also may pursue any of the following separately, successively or simultaneously:(i)    require the Grantor to, and the Grantor hereby agrees that it shall at its expense and promptly upon request of the Collateral Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by the Collateral Agent and make it available to the Collateral Agent at a place to be designated by the Collateral Agent that is reasonably convenient to both parties; (ii)    enter onto the property where any Collateral is located and take possession thereof with or without judicial process;(iii)    prior to the disposition of the Collateral, store, process, repair or recondition the Collateral or otherwise prepare the Collateral for disposition in any manner to the extent the Collateral Agent deems appropriate; and (iv)    without notice except as specified below or under the UCC, sell, assign, lease, license (on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis) or otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Collateral Agent’s offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, at such time or times and at such price or prices and upon such other terms as the Collateral Agent in its reasonable discretion may deem commercially reasonable.(b)     The Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party may be the purchaser of any or all of the Collateral at any public or private (to the extent to the portion of the Collateral being privately sold is of a kind that is customarily sold on a recognized market or the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations) sale in accordance with the UCC and the Collateral Agent, as collateral agent for and representative of the Secured Parties, shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale made in accordance with the UCC, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at such sale.  Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of the Grantor, and the Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by applicable law) all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.  The Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least 10 days’ notice to the Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification.  The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given.  The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.  The Grantor agrees that it would not be commercially unreasonable for the Collateral Agent to dispose of the Collateral or any portion thereof by using Internet sites that provide for the auction of assets of the types included in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capability of doing so, or that match buyers and sellers of assets.  So long as such sale is conducted in a commercially reasonable manner, the Grantor hereby waives any claims against the Collateral Agent arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Collateral Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree.  If the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all the Obligations, the Grantor shall be liable for the deficiency and the reasonable fees and expenses of any attorneys employed by the Collateral Agent to collect such deficiency.  The Grantor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 8.1 will cause irreparable injury to the Collateral Agent, that the Collateral Agent has no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section 8.1 shall be specifically enforceable against the Grantor, and the Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no default has occurred giving rise to the Obligations becoming due and payable prior to their stated maturities.  Nothing in this Section 8.1 shall in any way alter the rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder.(c)    The Collateral Agent may sell the Collateral without giving any warranties as to the Collateral.  The Collateral Agent may specifically disclaim or modify any warranties of title or the like.  This procedure will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral.(d)    The Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to marshal any of the Collateral.8.2    Application of Proceeds(a)    Any Proceeds constituting Collateral to be applied by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Loan Documents upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default and in connection with the enforcement, collection or realization in respect of any Collateral by the Collateral Agent, shall be applied in the following order:(i)    First, to pay incurred and unpaid fees and expenses of the Agents under the Loan Documents;(ii)    Second, to the Collateral Agent, for application by it towards payment, without duplication, of (a) all interest, breakage costs and fees then due and payable under the Loan Documents and (b) any ordinary course settlement payments and any interest due and payable to any Specified Swap Counterparty under any Secured Swap Agreements, pro rata among the Secured Parties according to the amounts of such Obligations then due and owing and remaining unpaid to the Secured Parties;(iii)    Third, to the Collateral Agent, for application by it towards payment, without duplication, of (a) all principal and premium (if any) then due and payable under the Loan Documents and (b) any termination payments payable to any Specified Swap Counterparty under any Secured Swap Agreements, pro rata among the Secured Parties according to the amounts of such Obligations then due and owing and remaining unpaid to the Secured Parties; (iv)    Fourth, to the Collateral Agent, on a pro rata basis, for application by it towards payment of all other Obligations due and owing and remaining unpaid to the Secured Parties under the Loan Documents and the Secured Swap Agreements; and(v)    Fifth, any balance remaining after the Discharge of the Obligations shall be paid over to the Grantor or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same. (b)    No sale or other disposition of all or any part of the Collateral pursuant to Section 8.1 shall be deemed to relieve the Grantor of its obligations under any Loan Document except to the extent the proceeds thereof are applied to the payment of such obligations.8.3    Sales on Credit.  If the Collateral Agent sells any of the Collateral upon credit, the Grantor will be credited only with payments actually made by the purchaser and received by the Collateral Agent and applied to indebtedness of the purchaser.  In the event the purchaser fails to pay for the Collateral, the Collateral Agent may resell the Collateral and the Grantor shall be credited with proceeds of the sale.8.4    Investment Related Property.  The Grantor recognizes that the Collateral Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Investment Related Property, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire the Investment Related Property for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof.  The Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions (including a public offering made pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act) and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner.  The Collateral Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Investment Related Property for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if such Issuer would agree to do so.  If the Collateral Agent exercises its right to sell any or all of the Investment Related Property, upon written request, the Grantor shall and shall cause each Issuer of any Pledged Equity Interests to be sold hereunder, each partnership and each limited liability company from time to time to furnish to the Collateral Agent all such information as the Collateral Agent may request in order to determine the number and nature of interest, shares or other instruments included in the Investment Related Property which may be sold by the Collateral Agent in exempt transactions under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, as the same are from time to time in effect.  8.5    Intellectual Property(a)    Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default:(i)    the Collateral Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation) to bring suit or otherwise commence any action or proceeding in the name of the Grantor, the Collateral Agent or otherwise, in the Collateral Agent’s sole discretion, to enforce any Intellectual Property constituting Collateral, in which event the Grantor shall, at the request of the Collateral Agent, do any and all lawful acts and execute any and all documents required by the Collateral Agent in aid of such enforcement and the Grantor shall promptly, upon demand, reimburse and indemnify the Collateral Agent as provided in Section 9.05 of the Credit Agreement in connection with the exercise of its rights under this Section, and, to the extent that the Collateral Agent shall elect not to bring suit to enforce any Intellectual Property as provided in this Section 8.5, the Grantor agrees to use all reasonable measures, whether by action, suit, proceeding or otherwise, to prevent the infringement or other violation of any of the Grantor’s rights in the Intellectual Property constituting Collateral by others and for that purpose agrees to diligently maintain any action, suit or proceeding against any Person so infringing as shall be necessary to prevent such infringement or violation;(ii)    upon written demand from the Collateral Agent, the Grantor shall grant, assign, convey or otherwise transfer to the Collateral Agent or such Collateral Agent’s designee all of the Grantor’s right, title and interest in and to the Intellectual Property constituting Collateral and shall execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent such documents as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement;(iii)    the Grantor agrees that such an assignment and/or recording shall be applied to reduce the Obligations outstanding only to the extent that the Collateral Agent (or any Secured Party) receives cash proceeds in respect of the sale of, or other realization upon, the Intellectual Property constituting Collateral; and(iv)    the Collateral Agent shall have the right to notify, or require the Grantor to notify, any obligors with respect to amounts due or to become due to the Grantor in respect of the Intellectual Property of the Grantor constituting Collateral, of the existence of the security interest created herein, to direct such obligors to make payment of all such amounts directly to the Collateral Agent, and, upon such notification and at the expense of the Grantor, to enforce collection of any such amounts and to adjust, settle or compromise the amount or payment thereof, in the same manner and to the same extent as the Grantor might have done;(A)    all amounts and proceeds (including checks and other instruments) received by the Grantor in respect of amounts due to the Grantor in respect of the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent hereunder, shall be segregated from other funds of the Grantor and shall be forthwith paid over or delivered to the Collateral Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement) to be held as cash Collateral and applied as provided by Section 8.2; and(B)    the Grantor shall not adjust, settle or compromise the amount or payment of any such amount or release wholly or partly any obligor with respect thereto or allow any credit or discount thereon.(b)    If (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and, by reason of cure, waiver, modification, amendment or otherwise, no longer be continuing, (ii) no other Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (iii) an assignment or other transfer to the Collateral Agent of any rights, title and interests in and to the Intellectual Property constituting Collateral shall have been previously made and shall have become absolute and effective, and (iv) the Obligations shall not have become immediately due and payable, upon the written request of the Grantor, the Collateral Agent shall promptly execute and deliver to the Grantor, at the Grantor’s sole cost and expense, such assignments or other transfer as may be necessary to reassign to the Grantor any such rights, title and interests as may have been assigned to the  Collateral Agent as aforesaid, subject to any disposition thereof that may have been made by the Collateral Agent; provided that, after giving effect to such reassignment, the Collateral Agent’s security interest granted pursuant hereto, as well as all other rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent granted hereunder, shall continue to be in full force and effect; and provided, further, that the rights, title and interests so reassigned shall be free and clear of any other Liens granted by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties.(c)    Solely for the purpose of enabling the Collateral Agent to exercise rights and remedies under this Section 8 and at such time as the Collateral Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, the Grantor hereby grants to the Collateral Agent, to the extent it has the right to do so, an irrevocable, nonexclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the Grantor), subject, in the case of Trademarks, to sufficient rights to quality control and inspection in favor of the Grantor to avoid the risk of invalidation of said Trademarks, to use, operate under, license, or sublicense any Intellectual Property constituting Collateral now owned or hereafter acquired by the Grantor, and wherever the same may be located.8.6    Investment Accounts.  If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent shall (at the written direction of the Administrative Agent) send to each bank, securities intermediary or issuer party to any Control Agreement or Uncertificated Securities Control Agreement, a “Notice of Sole Control” or similar notice as defined in and under such Agreement, and shall apply all proceeds therefrom in accordance with this Agreement and the other Security Documents.SECTION 9.    AMENDMENTS.  None of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except pursuant to an agreement in writing entered into by the Grantor and the Collateral Agent and otherwise in accordance with the Credit Agreement; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any provision of any Loan Document to the contrary, any schedule hereto may be amended or supplemented from time to time solely by written notice to the Collateral Agent from the Grantor (and such amendment or supplement shall become effective upon delivery of any such notice).SECTION 10.    CONTINUING SECURITY INTEREST; TRANSFER OF ADVANCES.  This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall remain in full force and effect until the Discharge of the Obligations, be binding upon the Grantor, its successors and assigns, and inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and its successors, transferees and assigns.  SECTION 11.    STANDARD OF CARE; COLLATERAL AGENT MAY PERFORM.  The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers.  Except for the exercise of reasonable care in the custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder and other requirements of law or the UCC, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral.  To the extent permitted by law, the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Collateral Agent accords its own property.  Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty as to any of the Collateral in its possession or control or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee or any income thereon or as to preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining thereto, and the Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for filing any financing or continuation statements or recording any documents or instruments in any public office at any time or times or otherwise perfecting or maintaining the perfection of any security interest in the Collateral.  Neither the Collateral Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon all or any part of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of the Grantor or otherwise.  If the Grantor fails to perform any agreement contained herein, the Collateral Agent may itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement, and the expenses of the Collateral Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the Grantor under the Credit Agreement.SECTION 12.    NOTICES.  Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be given in accordance with the Credit Agreement.SECTION 13.    RELEASESUpon the Discharge of the Obligations, and subject to Section 21, the Collateral shall be automatically released from the Liens created hereby, and this Agreement and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive such termination) of the Collateral Agent and the Grantor hereunder shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any party, and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to the Grantor.  At the request and sole expense of the Grantor following any such termination, the Collateral Agent shall deliver to the Grantor any Collateral held by the Collateral Agent hereunder, and execute and deliver to the Grantor such documents or otherwise authorize the filing of such documents as the Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination. If any of the Collateral shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Grantor in a transaction permitted by any Loan Documents or consented to in accordance with the Loan Documents, then the Collateral Agent, at the request and at the sole expense of the Grantor (with written confirmation from the Administrative Agent), shall execute and deliver to the Grantor all releases or authorize the filing of other documents reasonably necessary or desirable for the release of the Liens created hereby on such Collateral; provided that the Grantor shall have delivered to the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent, at least 5 Business Days prior to the date of the proposed release, a written request for release identifying the relevant Collateral and the terms of the sale or other disposition in reasonable detail, including the price thereof and any expenses in connection therewith, together with a certification by the Grantor stating that such transaction is in compliance with the Loan Documents and the Proceeds of such Collateral will be applied in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, if applicable.SECTION 14.    MISCELLANEOUSNo failure or delay on the part of the Collateral Agent in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege.  All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.  In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.  All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a default or an event of default under the Loan Documents if such action is taken or condition exists.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the Grantor and their respective successors and assigns.  The Grantor shall not, without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent given in accordance with the Credit Agreement, assign any right, duty or obligation hereunder.  There are no unwritten oral agreements between the parties.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument; signature pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to the same document.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement or any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith by facsimile or other electronic delivery (including by certified electronic signature) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement or such other document or instrument, as applicable.The Grantor’s waiver of rights or agreements in respect of Collateral, the exercise of remedies, standards of care, notice and the other matters covered by Sections 5 through 8 are in each case qualified that such waivers or agreements are being made to the fullest extent permitted by law.SECTION 15.    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.  The Grantor hereby acknowledges that (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party; (b) neither the Collateral Agent nor any Secured Party has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Grantor arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Grantor, on the one hand, and the Collateral Agent and Secured Parties, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor and (c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among the Secured Parties or among the Grantor and the Secured Parties.SECTION 16.    HEADINGS.

Each Pledgor waives notice of any default under the Borrower Obligations.(c)    Each Pledgor further agrees that its guarantee herein constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to any security held for payment of the Borrower Obligations.  (d)    Except as set forth in Sections 9.08 and 9.18 of the Credit Agreement, the obligations of each Pledgor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than payment of the Borrower Obligations in full or the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Pledgor's liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Borrower Obligations or otherwise.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the Pledgor Obligations shall be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (a) the failure of the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Borrower or any other person under this Agreement or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement; (d) the release or non-perfection of any security held by any Lender or the Collateral Agent for the Borrower Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to exercise any right or remedy against any other Loan Party; (f) any change in the ownership of any Loan Party; (g) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Borrower Obligations, or (h) any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Pledgor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Pledgor as a matter of law or equity.(e)    Each Pledgor agrees that its guarantee herein shall remain in full force and effect until the Discharge of the Obligations.  Each Pledgor further agrees that its guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the Borrower Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise.(f)    Each Pledgor hereby guarantees that payments hereunder will be paid to the Collateral Agent in cash upon demand by the Collateral Agent without set-off or counterclaim.(g)    Each Pledgor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Borrower Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in the Credit Agreement for the purposes of its Guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Borrower Obligations guaranteed hereby arising in connection with any Bankruptcy Event with respect to any Loan Party or otherwise and (y) in the event of any such declaration of acceleration of such Borrower Obligations, such Borrower Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Pledgors for the purposes of this Guarantee.2.2    Limitation on Liability.  Any term or provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Pledgor hereunder will be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Pledgor, result in the obligations of such Pledgor under its guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law and not otherwise being void or voidable under any similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.2.3    No Subrogation.  Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by the Pledgors hereunder, no Pledgor shall be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of any Secured Party against the Borrower or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by any Secured Party for the payment of the Borrower Obligations, nor shall any Pledgor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the Borrower in respect of payments made by such Pledgor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Secured Parties by the Borrower on account of the Borrower Obligations are paid in full.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, and after written notice thereof delivered by the Collateral Agent to the Pledgors in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (it being acknowledged and agreed that the Collateral Agent shall not be required to deliver any such notice to a Pledgor that is the subject of a Bankruptcy Event), all voting and other rights of each Pledgor with respect to the Collateral which such Pledgor would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise shall cease; (ii)    the Collateral Agent shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to each Pledgor all proxies, and other instruments as such Pledgor, at its sole cost and expense, may from time to time reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such Pledgor to exercise the voting and other consensual rights when and to the extent which it is entitled to exercise pursuant to clause (i) above; and(iii)    each Pledgor shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all dividends, interest and other distributions paid in respect of the Pledged Equity Interests for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or the Loan Documents.

In the event of a transfer pursuant to clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Collateral Agent shall within a reasonable period of time thereafter give each Pledgor notice of such transfer; provided, however, that (x) failure to give such notice shall have no effect on the rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder and (y) the Collateral Agent shall not be required to deliver any such notice to a Pledgor that is the subject of a Bankruptcy Event or the delivery of such notice is otherwise prohibited by applicable law;(ii)    all respective rights of the Pledgors to receive the dividends, interest and other distributions that they would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to Section 3.5(a)(iii) shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent who shall thereupon have the sole right to receive and hold as Pledged Equity Interests such dividends, interest and other distributions; (iii)    in order to permit the Collateral Agent to exercise the voting and other consensual rights which it may be entitled to exercise pursuant hereto and to receive all dividends and other distributions which it may be entitled to receive hereunder, in each case, in respect of the Pledged Equity Interests constituting Collateral: (1) each Pledgor shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to the Collateral Agent, at such Pledgor’s sole cost and expense, all proxies, dividend payment orders and other instruments as the Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request and (2) each Pledgor acknowledges that the Collateral Agent may utilize the power of attorney set forth in Section 6.1; and(iv)    each Pledgor hereby authorizes and instructs the Borrower to comply with any instruction received by it from the Collateral Agent in writing that (x) states that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (y) is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or further instructions from such Pledgor.(c)    All distributions and other amounts which are received by a Pledgor contrary to the provisions of this Agreement shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, shall be segregated from other funds of such Pledgor and shall be forthwith paid over to the Collateral Agent as Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).3.6    Authorization.

The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder are solely to protect the interests of the Secured Parties in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to exercise any such powers.  The Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to the Pledgors for any act or failure to act hereunder, except in the case of their own gross negligence or willful misconduct, except in the case of their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.SECTION 7.    REMEDIES.7.1    Generally.(a)    If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to all other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it at law or in equity, all the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent on default under the UCC (whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral) to collect, enforce or satisfy any Obligations then owing, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and also may pursue any of the following separately, successively or simultaneously:(i)    require the Pledgors to, and the Pledgors hereby agree that each Pledgor shall at its expense and promptly upon request of the Collateral Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by the Collateral Agent and make it available to the Collateral Agent at a place to be designated by the Collateral Agent that is reasonably convenient to both parties; (ii)    enter onto the property where any Collateral is located and take possession thereof with or without judicial process; and(iii)    without notice except as specified below or under the UCC, sell, assign or otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Collateral Agent’s offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, at such time or times and at such price or prices and upon such other terms as the Collateral Agent in its reasonable discretion may deem commercially reasonable.(b)    The Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party may be the purchaser of any or all of the Collateral at any public or private (to the extent to the portion of the Collateral being privately sold is of a kind that is customarily sold on a recognized market or the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations) sale in accordance with the UCC and the Collateral Agent, as collateral agent for and representative of the Secured Parties, shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale made in accordance with the UCC, to use and apply any of the Pledgor Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at such sale.  Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Pledgor, and each Pledgor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by applicable law) all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.  Each Pledgor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least 10 days’ notice to such Pledgor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification.  The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given.  The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.  Each Pledgor agrees that it would not be commercially unreasonable for the Collateral Agent to dispose of the Collateral or any portion thereof by using Internet sites that match buyers and sellers of assets.  So long as such sale is conducted in a commercially reasonable manner, each Pledgor hereby waives any claims against the Collateral Agent arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Collateral Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree.  If the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all the Obligations, each Pledgor shall be liable for the deficiency and the reasonable fees of any attorneys employed by the Collateral Agent to collect such deficiency.  Each Pledgor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 7.1 will cause irreparable injury to the Collateral Agent, that the Collateral Agent has no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section 7.1 shall be specifically enforceable against any Pledgor, and each Pledgor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no default has occurred giving rise to the Obligations becoming due and payable prior to their stated maturities.  Nothing in this Section 7.1 shall in any way alter the rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder.(c)    The Collateral Agent may sell the Collateral without giving any warranties as to the Collateral.  The Collateral Agent may specifically disclaim or modify any warranties of title or the like.  This procedure will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral.(d)    The Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to marshal any of the Collateral.7.2    Application of Proceeds.  (a)    Any Proceeds constituting Collateral to be applied by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Loan Documents upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default and in connection with the enforcement, collection or realization in respect of any Collateral by the Collateral Agent, shall be applied in the following order:(i)    First, to pay incurred and unpaid fees and expenses of the Agents under the Loan Documents;(ii)    Second, to the Collateral Agent, for application by it towards payment, without duplication, of (x) all interest, breakage costs and fees then due and payable under the Loan Documents and (y) any ordinary course settlement payments and any interest due and payable to any Specified Swap Counterparty under any Secured Swap Agreements, pro rata among the Secured Parties according to the amounts of such Obligations then due and owing and remaining unpaid to the Secured Parties;(iii)    Third, to the Collateral Agent, for application by it towards payment, without duplication, of (x) all principal and premium (if any) then due and payable under the Loan Documents and (y) any termination payments payable to any Specified Swap Counterparty under any Secured Swap Agreements, pro rata among the Secured Parties according to the amounts of such Obligations then due and owing and remaining unpaid to the Secured Parties; (iv)    Fourth, to the Collateral Agent, on a pro rata basis, for application by it towards payment of all other Obligations due and owing and remaining unpaid to the Secured Parties under the Loan Documents and the Secured Swap Agreements; and (v)    Fifth, any balance remaining after the Discharge of the Obligations shall be paid over to the applicable Pledgor or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same.Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amounts received from any Pledgor shall be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligations of such Pledgor.(b)    No sale or other disposition of all or any part of the Collateral pursuant to Section 7.1 shall be deemed to relieve any Pledgor of its obligations under any Loan Document except to the extent the proceeds thereof are applied to the payment of such obligations.7.3    Sales on Credit.  If the Collateral Agent sells any of the Collateral upon credit, the applicable Pledgor will be credited only with payments actually made by the purchaser and received by the Collateral Agent and applied to indebtedness of the purchaser.  In the event the purchaser fails to pay for the Collateral, the Collateral Agent may resell the Collateral and such Pledgor shall be credited with proceeds of the sale.7.4    Pledged Equity Interests.  Each Pledgor recognizes that the Collateral Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Pledged Equity Interests, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire the Pledged Equity Interests for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof.  Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions (including a public offering made pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act) and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner.  The Collateral Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Equity Interests for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if such issuer would agree to do so.  If the Collateral Agent exercises its right to sell any or all of the Pledged Equity Interests, upon written request, the applicable Pledgor shall and shall cause the issuer of such Pledged Equity Interests from time to time to furnish to the Collateral Agent all such information as the Collateral Agent may request in order to determine the number and nature of interest, shares or other instruments included in the Pledged Equity Interests which may be sold by the Collateral Agent in exempt transactions under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, as the same are from time to time in effect.7.5    Enforcement Expenses.  (a)    Each Pledgor agrees to pay or reimburse each Secured Party for all its reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred in collecting against such Pledgor under the Guarantee contained in Section 2 or otherwise enforcing or protecting any rights under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of counsel to the Collateral Agent and of any other necessary counsel.(b)    The agreement in this Section 7.5 shall survive the Discharge of the Obligations.SECTION 8.    AMENDMENTSNone of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except pursuant to an agreement in writing entered into by each Pledgor and the Collateral Agent and otherwise in accordance with the Credit Agreement; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any provision of the Loan Documents to the contrary, any Schedule hereto may be amended or supplemented from time to time solely by written notice to the Collateral Agent from any Pledgor (and such amendment or supplement shall become effective upon delivery of any such notice).SECTION 9.    CONTINUING SECURITY INTEREST; TRANSFER OF ADVANCES.  This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall remain in full force and effect until the Discharge of the Obligations, be binding upon each Pledgor, its successors and assigns, and inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties and their successors, transferees and assigns. SECTION 10.    STANDARD OF CARE; COLLATERAL AGENT MAY PERFORM.  The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers.  Except for the exercise of reasonable care in the custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder and other requirements of law or the UCC, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral.  To the extent permitted by law, the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Collateral Agent accords its own property.  Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty as to any of the Collateral in its possession or control or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee or any income thereon or as to preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining thereto, and the Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for filing any financing or continuation statements or recording any documents or instruments in any public office at any time or times or otherwise perfecting or maintaining the perfection of any security interest in the Collateral.  Neither the Collateral Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon all or any part of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of a Pledgor or otherwise. If any Pledgor fails to perform any agreement contained herein, the Collateral Agent may itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement, and the expenses of the Collateral Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by such Pledgor or the Borrower under the Credit Agreement.SECTION 11.    NOTICES.  Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be given in accordance with the Credit Agreement.SECTION 12.    RELEASEUpon the Discharge of the Obligations, and subject to Section 19, the Collateral shall be automatically released from the Liens created hereby, and this Agreement and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive such termination) of the Collateral Agent and the Pledgors hereunder shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any party, and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to the Pledgors.  At the request and sole expense of any Pledgor following any such termination, the Collateral Agent shall deliver to such Pledgor any Collateral held by the Collateral Agent hereunder, and execute and deliver to such Pledgor such documents or otherwise authorize the filing of such documents as such Pledgor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination.If any of the Collateral shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by a Pledgor in a transaction permitted by any Loan Document or consented to in accordance with the Loan Documents, then the Collateral Agent, at the request and at the sole expense of such Pledgor (with written confirmation from the Administrative Agent), shall execute and deliver to such Pledgor all releases or authorize the filing of other documents reasonably necessary or desirable for the release of the Liens created hereby on such Collateral; provided that such Pledgor shall have delivered to the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent, at least 5 Business Days prior to the date of the proposed release, a written request for release identifying the Collateral and the terms of the sale or other disposition in reasonable detail, including the price thereof and any expenses in connection therewith, together with a certification by such Pledgor stating that such transaction is in compliance with the Loan Documents and the Proceeds of such Collateral will be applied in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, if applicable.SECTION 13.    MISCELLANEOUS.  No failure or delay on the part of the Collateral Agent in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege.  All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.  In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.  All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a default or an event of default under the Loan Documents if such action is taken or condition exists.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the Pledgors and their respective successors and assigns.  No Pledgor shall, without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent given in accordance with the Credit Agreement, assign any right, duty or obligation hereunder.  There are no unwritten oral agreements between the parties.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument; signature pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to the same document.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement or any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith by facsimile or other electronic delivery (including by certified electronic signature) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement or such other document or instrument, as applicable.Each Pledgor’s waiver of rights or agreements in respect of Collateral, the exercise of remedies, standards of care, notice and the other matters covered by Sections 2 through 7 are in each case qualified that such waivers or agreements are being made to the fullest extent permitted by law.SECTION 14.    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.  Each Pledgor hereby acknowledges that (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party; (b) neither the Collateral Agent nor any Secured Party has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to any Pledgor arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between each Pledgor, on the one hand, and the Collateral Agent and Secured Parties, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor and (c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among the Secured Parties or among the Pledgors and the Secured Parties.SECTION 15.    HEADINGS.
