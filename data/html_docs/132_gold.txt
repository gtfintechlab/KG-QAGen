“Additional Guarantor Supplement” means form attached hereto as Exhibit F or such other form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent.

“Affected Financial Institution” means (a) any EEA Financial Institution or (b) any UK Financial Institution.

A Person shall be deemed to control another Person for purposes of this definition if such Person possesses, directly or indirectly, the power to direct, or cause the direction of, the management and policies of the other Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, common directors, trustees or officers, by contract or otherwise; provided that, in any event for purposes of this definition, any Person that owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the securities having the ordinary voting power for the election of directors or governing body of a corporation or 10% or more of the partnership or other ownership interest of any other Person (other than as a limited partner of such other Person) will be deemed to

The Applicable Margin shall be established based on the Total Leverage Ratio for the most recently completed fiscal quarter and the Applicable Margin established on a Pricing Date shall remain in effect until the next Pricing Date. If Borrower has not delivered its financial statements by the date such financial statements (and, in the case of the year-end financial statements, audit report) are required to be delivered under Section 6.5, until such financial statements and audit report are delivered, the Applicable Margin shall be the highest Applicable Margin (i.e., Level V shall apply). If Borrower subsequently delivers such financial statements before the next Pricing Date, the Applicable Margin established by such late delivered financial statements shall take effect from the date of delivery until the next Pricing Date. In all other circumstances, the Applicable Margin established by such financial statements shall be in effect from the Pricing Date that occurs immediately after the end of the fiscal quarter covered by such financial statements until the next Pricing Date. Each determination of the Applicable Margin made by Administrative Agent in accordance with the foregoing shall be conclusive and binding on Borrower and the Lenders absent manifest error.
 
If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of Borrower or for any other reason, Borrower or the Administrative Agent determines that (i) the Total Leverage Ratio as calculated by Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Total Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of any Event of Default described in Section 8.1(j) or (k) with respect to Borrower has occurred and is continuing, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for

This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under any other provision of the Loan Documents.

“Available Tenor” means, as of any date of determination and with respect to the then-current Benchmark, as applicable, any tenor for such Benchmark or payment period for interest calculated with reference to such Benchmark, as applicable, that is or may be used for determining the length of an Interest Period pursuant to this Agreement as of such date and not including, for the avoidance of doubt, any tenor for such Benchmark that is then-removed from the definition of “Interest Period” pursuant to clause (e) of Section 3.9.
 
“Bail-In Action” means the exercise of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority in respect of any liability of an Affected Financial Institution.
 
“Bail-In Legislation” means (a) with respect to any EEA Member Country implementing Article 55 of Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union, the implementing law, regulation, rule or requirement for such EEA Member Country from time to time which is described in the EU Bail-In Legislation Schedule and (b) with respect to the United Kingdom, Part I of the United Kingdom Banking Act 2009 (as amended from time to time) and any other law, regulation or rule applicable in the United Kingdom relating to the resolution of unsound or failing banks, investment firms or other financial institutions or their affiliates (other than through liquidation, administration or other insolvency proceedings).
 
“Base Rate” means, for any day, the rate per annum equal to the greatest of: (a) the rate of interest announced or otherwise established by Administrative Agent from time to time as its prime commercial rate, or its equivalent, for U.S. Dollar loans to borrowers located in the United States as in effect on such day, with any change in the Base Rate resulting from a change in said prime commercial rate to be effective as of the date of the relevant change in said prime commercial rate (it being acknowledged and agreed that such rate may not be Administrative Agent’s best or lowest rate), (b) the sum of (i) the rate determined by Administrative Agent to be the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) of

739016937 20664705

 

 


 
 

 
Agreement or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Term SOFR Event, and the delivery of a Term SOFR Notice, on the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date the “Benchmark Replacement” shall revert to and shall be deemed to be the sum of (a) Term SOFR and (b) the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment, as set forth in clause (1) of this definition (subject to the first proviso above).
 
If the Benchmark Replacement as determined pursuant to clause (1), (2) or (3) above would be less than the Floor, the Benchmark Replacement will be deemed to be the Floor for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
 
“Benchmark Replacement Adjustment” means, with respect to any replacement of the then current Benchmark with an Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for any applicable Interest Period and Available Tenor for any setting of such Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement:
(1)for purposes of clauses (1) and (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement,” the first alternative set forth in the order below that can be determined by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion:
(a)the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) as of the Reference Time such Benchmark Replacement is first set for such Interest Period that has been selected or recommended by the Relevant Governmental Body for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for the applicable Corresponding Tenor;
 
(b)the spread adjustment (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) as of the Reference Time such Benchmark Replacement is first set for such Interest Period that would apply to the fallback rate for a derivative transaction referencing the ISDA Definitions to be effective upon an index cessation event with respect to such Benchmark for the applicable Corresponding Tenor; and
 
(2)for purposes of clause (3) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement,” the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) that has been selected by the Administrative Agent and Borrower for the applicable Corresponding Tenor giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement by the Relevant Governmental Body on the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date and/or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities; provided that, in the case of clause (1) above, such adjustment is displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such Benchmark Replacement Adjustment from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion.
 
“Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes” means, with respect to any Benchmark Replacement, any technical, administrative or operational changes (including changes to the definition of “Base Rate,” the definition of “Business Day,” the definition of “Interest Period,” the timing and frequency

of determining rates and making payments of interest, the timing of borrowing requests or prepayment, conversion or continuation notices, the length of lookback periods, the applicability of breakage provisions, and other technical, administrative or operational matters) that the Administrative Agent, in its reasonable discretion in consultation with Borrower, decides may be appropriate to reflect the adoption and implementation of such Benchmark Replacement and to permit the administration thereof by the Administrative Agent in a manner substantially consistent with market practice (or, if the Administrative Agent decides that adoption of any portion of such market practice is not administratively feasible or if the Administrative Agent determines that no market practice for the administration of such Benchmark Replacement exists, in such other manner of administration as the Administrative Agent decides is reasonably necessary in connection with the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents).
 
“Benchmark Replacement Date” means the earliest to occur of the following events with respect to the then-current Benchmark:
(1)in the case of clause (1) or (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Transition Event,” the later of (a) the date of the public statement or publication of information referenced therein and (b) the date on which the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) permanently or indefinitely ceases to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof);
 
(2)in the case of clause (3) of the definition of “Benchmark Transition Event,” the date of the public statement or publication of information referenced therein;

739016937 20664705

 

 


 
 

 
from the date of issuance and each renewal) or thirty days prior to the Commitment Termination Date, in an aggregate face amount as set forth above, upon the receipt of an application duly executed by Borrower and, if such Letter of Credit is for the account of one of its Restricted Subsidiaries, such Restricted Subsidiary for the relevant Letter of Credit in the form then customarily prescribed by the L/C Issuer for the Letter of Credit requested (each an “Application”).

40

amount(s) in like funds). If Borrower does not make any such reimbursement payment on the date due and the Participating Lenders fund their participations therein in the manner set forth in Section 2.2(e) below, then all payments thereafter received by Administrative Agent in discharge of any of the relevant Reimbursement Obligations shall be distributed in accordance with Section 2.2(e) below.
 
(d)Obligations Absolute. Borrower’s obligation to reimburse L/C Obligations as provided in subsection (c) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the relevant Application under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, Borrower’s obligations hereunder. The responsibility of the L/C Issuer to Borrower and each Lender shall be only to determine that the documents (including each demand for payment) delivered under each Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment shall be in conformity in all material respects with such Letter of Credit. None of Administrative Agent, the Lenders, or the L/C Issuer shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the first sentence of this clause (d)), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the L/C Issuer; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the L/C Issuer from liability to Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable Law) suffered by Borrower that are caused by the L/C Issuer’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the L/C Issuer (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the L/C Issuer shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
 
(e)The Participating Interests. Each Lender (other than the Lender acting as L/C Issuer in issuing the relevant Letter of Credit), by its acceptance hereof, shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from the L/C Issuer,

Upon any failure by Borrower to pay any Reimbursement Obligation at the time required on the date the related drawing is to be paid, as set forth in Section 2.2(c) above, or if the L/C Issuer is required at any time to return to Borrower or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other Person any portion of any payment of any Reimbursement Obligation, each Participating Lender shall, not later than the Business Day it receives a certificate in the form of Exhibit A from the L/C Issuer (with a copy to Administrative Agent) to such effect, if such certificate is received before 1:00 p.m., or not later than 1:00 p.m. the following Business Day, if such certificate is received after such time, pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer an amount equal to such Participating Lender’s Percentage of such unpaid or recaptured Reimbursement Obligation together with interest on such amount accrued from the date the related payment was made by the L/C Issuer to the date of such payment by such Participating Lender at a rate per annum equal to: (i) from the date the related payment was made by the L/C Issuer to the date two (2) Business Days after payment by such Participating Lender is due hereunder, the Federal Funds Rate for each such day and (ii) from the date two (2) Business Days after the date such payment is due from such Participating Lender to the date such payment is made by such Participating Lender, the Base Rate in effect for each such day. Each such Participating Lender shall thereafter be entitled to receive its Percentage of each payment received in respect of the relevant Reimbursement Obligation and of interest paid thereon, with the L/C Issuer retaining its Percentage thereof as a Lender hereunder. The several obligations of the Participating Lenders to the L/C Issuer under this Section 2.2 shall be absolute, irrevocable, and unconditional under any and all circumstances whatsoever and shall not be subject to any set off, counterclaim or defense to payment which any Participating Lender may have or have had against Borrower, the L/C Issuer, Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person whatsoever. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such obligations shall not be affected by any Default or Event of Default or by any reduction or termination of the Commitment of any Lender, and each payment by a Participating Lender under this Section 2.2 shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
 
(f)Indemnification. The Participating Lenders shall, to the extent of their respective Percentages, indemnify the L/C Issuer (to the extent not reimbursed by Borrower) against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from such L/C Issuer’s gross negligence or willful misconduct) that the L/C Issuer may suffer or incur in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it. The obligations of the Participating Lenders under this Section 2.2(f) and all other parts of this Section 2.2 shall be unconditional, irrevocable and survive termination of this Agreement and of all Applications, Letters of Credit, and all drafts and other documents presented in connection with drawings thereunder.
 
(g)Manner of Requesting a Letter of Credit. Borrower shall provide at least five (5) Business Days’ advance written notice to Administrative Agent of each request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, such notice in each case to be accompanied by an Application for such Letter of Credit properly completed and executed by Borrower and, in the case of an extension or

amendment or an increase in the amount of a Letter of Credit, a written request therefor, in a form acceptable to Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, in each case, together with the fees called for by this Agreement. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the L/C Issuer of Administrative Agent’s receipt of each such notice (and the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to assume that the conditions precedent to any such issuance, extension, amendment or increase have been satisfied unless notified to the contrary by Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders) and the L/C Issuer shall promptly notify Administrative Agent and the Lenders of the issuance of the Letter of Credit so requested.
 
(h)Replacement of the L/C Issuer. The L/C Issuer may be replaced at any time by written agreement among Borrower, Administrative Agent, the replaced L/C Issuer and the successor L/C Issuer. Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the L/C Issuer. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced L/C Issuer. From and after the effective date of any such replacement (i) the successor L/C Issuer shall have all the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “L/C Issuer” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous L/C Issuer, or to such successor and all previous L/C Issuers, as the context shall require. After the replacement of a L/C Issuer hereunder, the replaced L/C Issuer shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of a L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
 
Section 2.3Applicable Interest Rates.(a) Base Rate Loans. Each Base Rate Loan made or maintained by a Lender shall bear interest (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and the actual days elapsed) on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date such Revolving Loan is advanced, or created by conversion from a Eurodollar Loan, until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect, payable by Borrower on each Interest Payment Date and at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise).
 
(b)Eurodollar Loans. Each Eurodollar Loan made or maintained by a Lender shall bear interest during each Interest Period it is outstanding (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed) on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date such Revolving Loan is advanced or continued, or created by conversion from a Base Rate Loan, until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Adjusted LIBOR applicable for such Interest Period, payable by Borrower on each Interest Payment Date and at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise).

is an integral multiple of $500,000. Without Administrative Agent’s consent, there shall not be more than six Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans outstanding hereunder at any one time.
 
Section 2.5Manner of Borrowing Revolving Loans and Designating Applicable Interest Rates.
 
(a)Notice to Administrative Agent. Borrower shall give notice to Administrative Agent by no later than 12:00 noon: (i) at least three (3) Business Days before the date on which Borrower requests the Lenders to advance a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans and (ii) on the date Borrower requests the Lenders to advance a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. The Revolving Loans included in each Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of rate specified in such notice of a new Borrowing. Thereafter, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Borrower may from time to time elect to change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each Borrowing or, subject to the minimum amount requirement for each outstanding Borrowing set forth in Section 2.4, a portion thereof, as follows: (i) if such Borrowing is of Eurodollar Loans, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, Borrower may continue part or all of such Borrowing as Eurodollar Loans or convert part or all of such Borrowing into Base Rate Loans or (ii) if such Borrowing is of Base Rate Loans, on any Business Day, Borrower may convert all or part of such Borrowing into Eurodollar Loans for an Interest Period or Interest Periods specified by Borrower. Borrower shall give all such notices requesting the advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing to Administrative Agent by telephone, telecopy, or other telecommunication device acceptable to Administrative Agent (which notice shall be irrevocable once given and, if by telephone, shall be promptly confirmed in writing), substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (Notice of Borrowing) or Exhibit C (Notice of Continuation/Conversion), as applicable, or in such other form acceptable to Administrative Agent. Notice of the continuation of a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans for an additional Interest Period or of the conversion of part or all of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans must be given by no later than 10:00 a.m. at least three (3) Business Days before the date of the requested continuation or conversion. All such notices concerning the advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing shall specify the date of the requested advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), the amount of the requested Borrowing to be advanced, continued or converted, the type of Revolving Loans to comprise such new, continued or converted Borrowing and, if such Borrowing is to be comprised of Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period applicable thereto. Upon notice to Borrower by Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, in the case of an Event of Default under Section 8.1(j) or 8.1(k) with respect to Borrower, without notice), no Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans shall be advanced, continued, or created by conversion if any Default or Event of Default then exists. Borrower agrees that Administrative Agent may rely on any such telephonic, telecopy or other telecommunication notice given by any person Administrative Agent in good faith believes is an Authorized Representative without the necessity of independent investigation, and in the event any such notice by telephone conflicts with any written confirmation such telephonic notice shall govern if Administrative Agent has acted in reliance thereon.
 
(b)Notice to the Lenders.Administrative Agent shall give prompt telephonic, telecopy or other telecommunication notice to each Lender of any notice from Borrower received pursuant to Section 2.5(a) above and, if such notice requests the Lenders to make Eurodollar Loans, 
 




 

44

 



739016937 20664705

 

 


 
 

 
Administrative Agent shall give notice to Borrower and each Lender by like means of the interest rate applicable thereto promptly after Administrative Agent has made such determination.
 
(c)Borrower’s Failure to Notify. If Borrower fails to give notice pursuant to Section 2.5(a) above of the continuation or conversion of any outstanding principal amount of a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans before the last day of its then current Interest Period within the period required by Section 2.5(a) and such Borrowing is not prepaid in accordance with Section 2.7(a), such Borrowing shall automatically be continued as the same type of Loan and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, having an Interest Period of one (1) month. In the event Borrower fails to give notice pursuant to Section 2.5(a) above of a Borrowing equal to the amount of a Reimbursement Obligation and has not notified Administrative Agent by 12:00 noon on the day such Reimbursement Obligation becomes due that it intends to repay such Reimbursement Obligation through funds not borrowed under this Agreement, Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans on such day in the amount of the Reimbursement Obligation then due, which Borrowing shall be applied to pay the Reimbursement Obligation then due.
 
(d)Disbursement of Revolving Loans. Not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of any requested advance of a new Borrowing, subject to Section 4, each Lender shall make available its Revolving Loan comprising part of such Borrowing in funds immediately available at the principal office of Administrative Agent in Chicago, Illinois (or at such other location as Administrative Agent shall designate). Administrative Agent shall make all such funds so received available to Borrower at Administrative Agent’s principal office in Chicago, Illinois (or at such other location as Administrative Agent shall designate), by depositing or wire transferring such proceeds to the credit of Borrower’s Designated Disbursement Account or as Borrower and Administrative Agent may otherwise agree.
 
(e)Administrative Agent Reliance on Lender Funding. Unless Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender prior to (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, by 1:00 p.m. on) the date on which such Lender is scheduled to make payment to Administrative Agent of the proceeds of a Revolving Loan (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that such Lender does not intend to make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such payment when due and Administrative Agent may (but shall not be required to) in reliance upon such assumption make available to Borrower the proceeds of the Revolving Loan to be made by such Lender and, if any Lender has not in fact made such payment to Administrative Agent, such Lender shall, on demand, pay to Administrative Agent the amount made available to Borrower attributable to such Lender together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was made available to Borrower and ending on (but excluding) the date such Lender pays such amount to Administrative Agent at a rate per annum equal to: (i) from the date the related advance was made by Administrative Agent to the date two (2) Business Days after payment by such Lender is due hereunder, the Federal Funds Rate for each such day and (ii)from the date two (2) Business Days after the date such payment is due from such Lender to the date such payment is made by such Lender, the Base Rate in effect for each such day. If such amount is not received from such Lender by Administrative Agent immediately upon demand, Borrower will, on demand, repay to Administrative Agent the proceeds of the Revolving Loan attributable to such Lender with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to the relevant Revolving Loan, but without such payment being considered

In the event of any conflict between the records maintained by any Lender and the records maintained by the Administrative Agent in such matters, the records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.
 
(d)Any Lender may request that its Revolving Loans be evidenced by a promissory note or notes in the forms of Exhibit D (referred to herein as a “Note”). In such event, Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to such Lender or its registered assigns. Thereafter, the Revolving Loans evidenced by such Note or Notes and interest thereon shall at all times (including after any assignment pursuant to Section 11.10) be represented by a Note payable to the order of the payee named therein or any assignee pursuant to Section 11.10, except to the extent that any such Lender or assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Revolving Loans once again be evidenced as described in subsections (a) and (b) above.

(a)Revolving Credit Commitment Fee.Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders in accordance with their Percentages a commitment fee (the “Commitment Fee”) at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed) on the average daily Unused Commitments.

Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 8 or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.14 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the L/C hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer’s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.15; fourth, (A) as Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Revolving Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Revolving Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer’s future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.15; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or the L/C Issuer against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Revolving Loans or Reimbursement Obligations in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Revolving Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Revolving Loans of, and unpaid Reimbursement Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Revolving Loans of, or unpaid Reimbursement Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Revolving Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments without giving effect to clause (iv) below. Any

payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 
(iii)Commitment and L/C Fees. (A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
 
(B)Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive L/C Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.16.
 
(C)With respect to any L/C Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (B) above, Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to the L/C Issuer the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to the L/C Issuer’s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.
(iv)Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans and participations in Reimbursement Obligations of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment. Subject to Section 11.27, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.
 
(v)Cash Collateral. If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer’s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.16.
 
(b)Defaulting Lender Cure. If Borrower, the Administrative Agent and L/C Issuer agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash

Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Revolving Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments (without giving effect to paragraph (a)(iv) above), whereupon, such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
(c)New Letters of Credit. So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the L/C Issuer shall not be required to issue, extend, increase, reinstate or renew any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.
 
Section 2.16Cash Collateral.
(a)Obligation to Cash Collateralize. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer’s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.
(b)Grant of Security Interest. Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lender’s obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations, to be applied pursuant to clause (c) below. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).
 
(c)Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section or Section 2.16 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender’s obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
 
(d)Termination of Requirement. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce the L/C Issuer’s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting 
 




 

53

 



739016937 20664705

 

 


 
 

 
Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to Section 2.16 the Person providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations and provided further that to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by Borrower, such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Loan Documents.
 
Section 2.17Increase in the Commitments.
 
Borrower may, on any Business Day prior to the Commitment Termination Date and with the written consent of the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), increase the aggregate amount of the Commitments by delivering an Increase Request substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H (or in such other form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) to the Administrative Agent at least five Business Days prior to the desired effective date of such increase (the “Revolver Increase”) identifying an additional Lender (or additional Commitment for an existing Lender) and the amount of its Commitment (or additional amount of its Commitment); provided, however, that:
 
(a)the aggregate amount of all such Revolver Increases shall not  exceed $25,000,000 and any such Revolver Increase shall be in an amount not less than $5,000,000 (or such lesser amount then agreed to by the Administrative Agent);
(b)no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of the request or the effective date of the Revolver Increase; and
 
(c)each of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5 and in the other Loan Documents shall be and remain true and correct in all material respects on the effective date of such Revolver Increase (where not already qualified by materiality, otherwise in all respects), except to the extent the same expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects (where not already qualified by materiality, otherwise in all respects) as of such earlier date.
 
The effective date of the Revolver Increase shall be agreed upon by Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Upon the effectiveness thereof, Schedule 1 shall be deemed amended to reflect the Revolver Increase and the new Lender (or, if applicable, existing Lender) shall advance Revolving Loans in an amount sufficient such that after giving effect to its Revolving Loans each Lender shall have outstanding its Percentage of all Revolving Loans outstanding under the Commitments. It shall be a condition to such effectiveness that if any Eurodollar Loans are outstanding on the date of such effectiveness, such Eurodollar Loans shall be deemed to be prepaid on such date and Borrower shall pay any amounts owing to the Lenders pursuant to Section 3.3. Borrower agrees to pay the reasonable and documented expenses of the Administrative Agent (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) relating to any Revolver Increase. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Commitment and no Lender’s Commitment shall be increased without its consent thereto, and each Lender may at its option, unconditionally and without cause, decline to increase its Commitment.

SECTION 3. TAXES; CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES.
Section 3.1Withholding Taxes.
(a)For purposes of this Section, the term “Lender” includes the L/C Issuer.
 
(b)Payments Free of Withholding. Except as otherwise required by law, each payment by Borrower and the Guarantors under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be made without withholding for or on account of any Taxes. If any such withholding is so required by applicable law, Borrower or such Guarantor shall make the withholding, pay the amount withheld to the appropriate Governmental Authority before penalties attach thereto or interest accrues thereon, and if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, forthwith pay such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by each Recipient free and clear of such Taxes (including such Taxes on such additional amount) is equal to the amount such Recipient would have received had such withholding not been made. If any Recipient pays any amount in respect of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts so reimbursed) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, Borrower or such Guarantor shall reimburse such Recipient for the full amount thereof within 10 days of demand in the currency in which such payment was made. If Borrower or such Guarantor pays any Taxes to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, it shall deliver official tax receipts evidencing that payment or certified copies thereof (or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) to the Recipient on whose account such withholding was made (with a copy to Administrative Agent if not the recipient of the original) on or before the thirtieth day after payment.
 
(c)U.S. Withholding Tax Exemptions. Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in paragraphs (i), (ii), and (iv) of this Section 3.1(c)) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
 
(i)any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or about the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower 
 




 

55

or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
 
(ii)any Lender that is not a U.S. Person (each, a “Foreign Lender”) shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(A)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W- 8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;
 
(B)executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(C)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” related to the Borrower as described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W 8BEN-E; or
 
(D)to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W- 8BEN, IRS Form W 8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2 or Exhibit B-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
 
(iii)any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed

739016937 20664705

 

 


 
 

 
by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(iv)if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (iv), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(d)Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
Section 3.2Documentary Taxes. Borrower agrees to pay on demand any present or future court or documentary, stamp, intangible, recording, filing or similar Taxes that arise from any payment 
 




 

57

 



739016937 20664705

 

 


 
 

 
made under, from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise in respect of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except any such Taxes that are Other Connection Taxes imposed with respect to an assignment (other than an assignment made pursuant to Section 2.14) (“Other Taxes”).
 
Section 3.3Funding Indemnity. If any Lender shall incur any loss, cost or expense (including any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or re-employment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or the relending or reinvesting of such deposits or amounts paid or prepaid to such Lender) as a result of:
 
(a)any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan on a date other than the last day of its Interest Period,
 
(b)any failure (because of a failure to meet the conditions of Section 4 or otherwise) by Borrower to borrow or continue a Eurodollar Loan, or to convert a Base Rate Loan into a Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 2.5(a),
 
(c)any failure by Borrower to make any payment of principal on any Eurodollar Loan when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), or
 
(d)any acceleration of the maturity of a Eurodollar Loan as a result of the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder, then, upon the demand of such Lender, Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amount as will reimburse such Lender for such loss, cost or expense. If any Lender makes such a claim for compensation, it shall provide to Borrower, with a copy to Administrative Agent, a certificate setting forth the amount of such loss, cost or expense in reasonable detail (including an explanation of the basis for and the computation of such loss, cost or expense) and the amounts shown on such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on Borrower absent manifest error.
 
Section 3.4Change in Law. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, if at any time any Change in Law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof makes it unlawful for any Lender to make or continue to maintain any Eurodollar Loans or to perform its obligations as contemplated hereby, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to Borrower and such Lender’s obligations to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans under this Agreement shall be suspended until it is no longer unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans. Borrower shall prepay on demand the outstanding principal amount of any such affected Eurodollar Loans, together with all interest accrued thereon and all other amounts then due and payable to such Lender under this Agreement; provided, that, subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Borrower may then elect to borrow the principal amount of the affected Eurodollar Loans from such Lender by means of Base Rate Loans from such Lender, which Base Rate Loans shall not be made ratably by the Lenders but only from such affected Lender.

Section 3.5Unavailability of Deposits or Inability to Ascertain, or Inadequacy of, LIBOR. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans:
(i)Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that deposits in U.S. Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to it in the interbank eurodollar market for such Interest Period, or that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable LIBOR (including, without limitation, because the LIBOR Index Rate is not available or published on a current basis), or
 
(ii)the Required Lenders advise Administrative Agent that (A) LIBOR as determined by Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding their Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period or (B) that the making or funding of Eurodollar Loans become impracticable, then Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon until Administrative Agent notifies Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (y) the obligations of the Lenders to create, continue, or effect by conversion Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended and (z) any request for a Eurodollar Loan shall be made as a Base Rate Loan.
 
Section 3.6Increased Cost and Reduced Return.
 
(a)If any Change in Law:
 
(i)shall subject any Lender (or its Lending Office) or the L/C Issuer to any Tax (other than an Indemnified Tax or an Excluded Tax) with respect to its Eurodollar Loans, its Notes, its Letter(s) of Credit, or its participation in any thereof, any Reimbursement Obligations owed to it or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, issue a Letter of Credit, or to participate therein, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
 
(ii)shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement (including any such requirement imposed by the FRB, but excluding with respect to any Eurodollar Loans any such requirement included in an applicable Eurodollar Reserve Percentage) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (or its Lending Office) or the L/C Issuer or shall impose on any Lender (or its Lending Office) or the L/C Issuer or on the interbank market any other condition affecting its Eurodollar Loans, its Notes, its Letter(s) of Credit, or its participation in any thereof, any Reimbursement Obligation owed to it, or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or to issue a Letter of Credit, or to participate therein; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender (or its Lending Office) or the L/C Issuer of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan, issuing or maintaining a Letter of Credit, or participating therein, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its Lending Office) or the L/C Issuer under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Lender or L/C Issuer to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Lender or 
 




 

59

 



739016937 20664705

 

 


 
 

 
L/C Issuer (with a copy to Administrative Agent), Borrower shall be obligated to pay to such Lender or L/C Issuer such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer for such increased cost or reduction.
 
(b)If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or L/C Issuer or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender’s or L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or L/C Issuer capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment of such Lender or the Revolving Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or L/C Issuer’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or L/C Issuer’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or L/C Issuer’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or L/C Issuer’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c)A certificate of a Lender or L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
Section 3.7Lending Offices.Each Lender may, at its option, elect to make its Revolving Loans hereunder at the branch, office or affiliate specified on the appropriate signature page hereof (each a “Lending Office”) for each type of Revolving Loan available hereunder or at such other of its branches, offices or affiliates as it may from time to time elect and designate in a written notice to Borrower and Administrative Agent. To the extent reasonably possible, a Lender shall designate an alternative branch or funding office with respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of Borrower to such Lender under Section 3.6 or to avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar Loans under Section 3.5, so long as such designation is not otherwise disadvantageous to the Lender.
 
Section 3.8Discretion of Lender as to Manner of Funding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of its Revolving Loans in any manner it sees fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all determinations hereunder with respect to Eurodollar Loans shall be made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained each Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of deposits in the interbank eurodollar market having a maturity corresponding to such Revolving Loan’s Interest Period, and bearing an interest rate equal to LIBOR for such Interest Period.
 
Section 3.9Effect of Benchmark Transition Event.
 
(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting

of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) or (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (3) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the 5th Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.

SECTION 9. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.
Section 9.1Appointment and Authorization of Administrative Agent. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer hereby appoints Bank of Montreal as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents and hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to take such action as Administrative Agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are delegated to Administrative Agent by the terms thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. Therefore, the Lenders and L/C Issuer expressly agree that Administrative Agent is not acting as a fiduciary of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer in respect of the Loan Documents, Borrower or otherwise, and nothing herein or in any of the other Loan Documents shall result in any duties or obligations on Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders or L/C Issuer except as expressly set forth herein. Except as provided in Section 7.1, the provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, and Borrower shall not have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.
 
The Administrative Agent shall also act as the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in its capacity as a potential obligee of any Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability) and the L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender and the L/C Issuer for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto (including, without limitation, to enter into additional Loan Documents or supplements to existing Loan Documents on behalf of the Secured Parties). In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as “collateral agent” and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 9 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of Sections 9 and 11 (including Section 11.13, as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.
 
Section 9.2Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
Section 9.3Action by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its 
 




 

95

 



739016937 20664705

 

 


 
 

 
duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law and (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder or under any other Loan Document unless it first receives such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all or other Lenders) as it deems appropriate and any further assurances of its indemnification from the Lenders that it may require, including prepayment of any related expenses and any other protection it requires against any and all costs, expense, and liability which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all or other Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Revolving Loans.
 
Section 9.4Consultation with Experts. Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel to Borrower), independent public accountants, and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
Section 9.5Liability of Administrative Agent; Credit Decision.
 
(a)Neither Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in connection with the Loan Documents: (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent in writing by Borrower, a Lender or the L/C Issuer. Neither Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify: (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Credit Event; , (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of Borrower or any Subsidiary contained herein or in any other Loan Document; (iv) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Section 4, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly 
 




 

96

 



739016937 20664705

 

 


 
 

 
required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent; or (v) the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, perfection, value, worth or collectability hereof or of any other Loan Document or of any other documents or writing furnished in connection with any Loan Document or of any Collateral; and Administrative Agent makes no representation of any kind or character with respect to any such matter mentioned in this sentence.
 
(b)The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Revolving Loan, or the issuance, extension, increase, reinstatement or renewal of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Revolving Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit In particular and without limiting any of the foregoing, Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for confirming the accuracy of any compliance certificate or other document or instrument received by it under the Loan Documents. Administrative Agent may treat the payee of any Obligation as the holder thereof until written notice of transfer shall have been filed with Administrative Agent signed by such payee in form satisfactory to Administrative Agent. Each Lender and L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has independently and without reliance on Administrative Agent or any other Lender or L/C Issuer (or any of their Related Parties), and based upon such information, investigations and inquiries as it deems appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to extend credit to Borrower in the manner set forth in the Loan Documents. It shall be the responsibility of each Lender and L/C Issuer to keep itself informed as to the creditworthiness of Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any Lender or L/C Issuer with respect thereto.
 
Section 9.6Indemnity. To the extent that Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under Section 11.13 to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought based on each Lender’s Percentage at such time) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid amount in respect of a claim asserted by such Lender); provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent the L/C Issuer in its capacity as such), or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement. Administrative Agent shall be entitled to offset amounts received for the account of a Lender under this Agreement against unpaid amounts due from such Lender to Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether as fundings of participations, indemnities or otherwise, and with any amounts offset for the benefit of Administrative Agent to be held by it for its own account and with any amounts offset for the benefit of a L/C Issuer to be remitted by Administrative Agent to or for the account of such L/C Issuer), but shall not be entitled to

offset against amounts owed to Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer by any Lender arising outside of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
 
Section 9.7Resignation of Administrative Agent and Successor Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer, and Borrower. Upon any such resignation of Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with Borrower, to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent’s giving of notice of resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective Date”) then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which may be any Lender hereunder or any commercial bank, or an Affiliate of a commercial bank, having an office in the United States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $200,000,000; provided, that in no event shall any such successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender. With effect from the Resignation Effective Date (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the L/C Issuer directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents.

Section 10.1The Guarantees. (a) To induce the Lenders and L/C Issuer to provide the credits described herein and in consideration of benefits expected to accrue to Borrower and the other Loan Parties by reason of the Commitments and for other good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, each Loan Party (including any Loan Party executing an Additional Guarantor Supplement) hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees jointly and severally to Administrative Agent, the Lenders, and the L/C Issuer and their Affiliates, the due and punctual payment of all present and future Obligations, Hedging Liability, and Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability, including, but not limited to, the due and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations, and the due and punctual payment and performance of all other Obligations now or hereafter owed by the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents and the due and punctual payment and performance of all Hedging Liability and Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability, in each case as and when the same shall become due and payable, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise, according to the terms hereof and thereof (including all interest, costs, fees, and charges after the entry of an order for relief against any Loan Party or such other obligor in a case under the United States Bankruptcy Code or any similar proceeding, whether or not such interest, costs, fees and charges w

(c)any change in the corporate existence, structure, or ownership of, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, or other similar proceeding affecting, any Loan Party or other obligor, any other guarantor, or any of their respective assets, or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Loan Party or other obligor or of any other guarantor contained in any Loan Document;
 
(d)the existence of any claim, set off, or other rights which any Loan Party or other obligor or any other guarantor may have at any time against Administrative Agent, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether or not arising in connection herewith;
 
(e)any failure to assert, or any assertion of, any claim or demand or any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights or remedies against any Loan Party or other obligor, any other guarantor, or any other Person or Property;
 
(f)any application of any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any obligation of any Loan Party or other obligor, regardless of what obligations of Borrower or other obligor remain unpaid;
 
(g)any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any Loan Party or other obligor or any other guarantor for any reason of this Agreement or of any other Loan Document or any agreement relating to any Guaranteed Obligations or any provision of applicable Law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by any Loan Party or other obligor or any other guarantor of the principal of or interest on any Revolving Loan or any Reimbursement Obligation or any other amount payable under the Loan Documents or any agreement relating to any Guaranteed Obligations; or
 
(h)any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by Administrative Agent, any Lender, the L/C Issuer, or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 10.
 
Section 10.3Discharge Only upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement in Certain Circumstances. Until such time as Payment in Full occurs, each Guarantor’s obligations under this Section 10 shall remain in full force and effect. If at any time any payment of any Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of Borrower or other obligor or of any guarantor, or otherwise, each Guarantor’s obligations under this Section 10 with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had become due but had not been made at such time.

Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and L/C Issuer (and their Affiliates) or be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Section 10.5Waivers. Each Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest, and any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by Administrative Agent, any Lender, the L/C Issuer, or any other Person against any Loan Party or other obligor, another guarantor, or any other Person.
 
Section 10.6Limit on Recovery. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10, the amount guaranteed by each Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the extent, if any, required so that its obligations hereunder shall not be subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, Uniform Voidable Transactions Act or similar statute or common law. In determining the limitations, if any, on the amount of any Guarantor’s obligations hereunder pursuant to the preceding sentence, it is the intention of the parties hereto that any rights of subrogation, indemnification or contribution which such Guarantor may have under this Section 10, any other agreement or applicable law shall be taken into account.
 
Section 10.7Contribution. (a) To the extent that any Guarantor shall make a payment under this Section 10 (a “Guarantor Payment”) which, taking into account all other Guarantor Payments then previously or concurrently made by any other Guarantor, exceeds the amount which otherwise would have been paid by or attributable to such Guarantor if each Guarantor had paid the aggregate Guaranteed Obligations satisfied by such Guarantor Payment in the same proportion as such Guarantor’s “Allocable Amount” (as defined below) (as determined immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment) bore to the aggregate Allocable Amounts of each of the Guarantors as determined immediately prior to the making of such Guarantor Payment, then, following indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guarantor Payment and the occurrence of Payment in Full, such Guarantor shall be entitled to receive contribution and indemnification payments from, and be reimbursed by, each other Guarantor for the amount of such excess, pro rata based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment.
 
(b)As of any date of determination, the “Allocable Amount” of any Guarantor shall be equal to the excess of the fair saleable value of the property of such Guarantor over the total liabilities of such Guarantor (including the maximum amount reasonably expected to become due in respect of contingent liabilities, calculated, without duplication, assuming each other Guarantor that is also liable for such contingent liability pays its ratable share thereof), giving effect to all payments made by other Guarantors as of such date in a manner to maximize the amount of such contributions.
 
(c)This Section 10.7 is intended only to define the relative rights of the Guarantors, and nothing set forth in this Section 10.7 is intended to or shall impair the obligations of the Guarantors, jointly and severally, to pay any amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Section 10.
 
(d)The parties hereto acknowledge that the rights of contribution and indemnification hereunder shall constitute assets of the Guarantor or Guarantors to which such contribution and indemnification is owing.
 




 

104

 



739016937 20664705

 

 


 
 

 
 
(e)The rights of the indemnifying Guarantors against other Guarantors under this Section 10.7 shall only be exercisable upon the occurrence of Payment in Full.
Section 10.8Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by any Loan Party or other obligor under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or under any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations, is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of such Loan Party or such obligor, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or under any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations, shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by Administrative Agent made at the request of the Required Lenders.
 
Section 10.9Benefit to Guarantors. The Guarantors are engaged in related businesses and integrated to such an extent that the financial strength and flexibility of each Guarantor has a direct impact on the success of each other Guarantor. Each Guarantor will derive substantial direct and indirect benefit from the extensions of credit hereunder.
 
Section 10.10 Guarantor Covenants. Each Guarantor shall take such action as Borrower is required by this Agreement to cause such Guarantor to take, and shall refrain from taking such action as Borrower is required by this Agreement to prohibit such Guarantor from taking.
 
SECTION 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 
Section 11.1 No Waiver, Cumulative Remedies. No delay or failure on the part of Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, or any Lender, or on the part of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations, in the exercise of any power or right under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof or as an acquiescence in any default, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. The rights and remedies hereunder of Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, the Lenders, and of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies which any of them would otherwise have.
 
Section 11.2 Non-Business Days. If any payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date of such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day on which date such payment shall be due and payable. In the case of any payment of principal falling due on a day which is not a Business Day, interest on such principal amount shall continue to accrue during such extension at the rate per annum then in effect, which accrued amount shall be due and payable on the next scheduled date for the payment of interest.
 
Section 11.3 Survival of Representations. All representations and warranties made herein or in any other Loan Document or in certificates given pursuant hereto or thereto shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the date as of which they were made as long as any credit is in use or available hereunder.
 
Section 11.4 Survival of Indemnity and Certain Other Provisions. All indemnity provisions and other provisions relative to reimbursement to the Lenders and L/C Issuer of amounts sufficient to

protect the yield of the Lenders and L/C Issuer with respect to the Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit, including, but not limited to, Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6, and 11.13, shall survive Payment in Full, and shall remain in force beyond the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations and payment or satisfaction in full of any single claim thereunder. All such indemnity and other provisions shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each Loan Party and shall inure to the benefit of each applicable Indemnitee and its successors and assigns.
 
Section 11.5 Sharing of Set Off. Each Lender agrees with each other Lender a party hereto that if such Lender shall receive and retain any payment, whether by set off or application of deposit balances or otherwise, on any of the Revolving Loans or Reimbursement Obligations in excess of its ratable share of payments on all such Obligations then outstanding to the Lenders, then such Lender shall purchase for cash at face value, but without recourse, ratably from each of the other Lenders such amount of the Revolving Loans or Reimbursement Obligations, or participations therein, held by each such other Lenders (or interest therein) as shall be necessary to cause such Lender to share such excess payment ratably with all the other Lenders; provided, that if any such purchase is made by any Lender, and if such excess payment or part thereof is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the related purchases from the other Lenders shall be rescinded ratably and the purchase price restored as to the portion of such excess payment so recovered, but without interest. For purposes of this Section, amounts owed to or recovered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Reimbursement Obligations in which Lenders have been required to fund their participation shall be treated as amounts owed to or recovered by the L/C Issuer as a Lender hereunder.

Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a Defaulting Lender, a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person, or Borrower or any of Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Revolving Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 9.6 with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s). Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the proviso of Section 11.11 that affects such Participant. Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1 through 3.4 and 3.6 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein) to the same extent

as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant Section 11.10; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.14 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.6, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.14 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.14 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 11.5 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Revolving Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, Revolving Loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, Revolving Loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
Section 11.10 Assignments. (a) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Revolving Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
 
(i)Minimum Amounts. (A) In the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and the Revolving Loans and participation interest in L/C Obligations at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and (B) in any case not described in subsection (a)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Revolving Loans and participation interest in L/C Obligations outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Revolving Loans and participation interest in L/C Obligations of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to Administrative Agent or, if “Effective Date” is specified in the Assignment and Acceptance, as of the Effective Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless each of Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
 
(ii)Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Revolving Loan or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit any

Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Credits on a non-pro rata basis.
 
(iii)Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by Section 11.10(a)(i)(B) and, in addition:
 
(b)the consent of Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (y) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof;
 
(c)the consent of Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender with a Commitment, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender; and
 
(d)the consent of the L/C Issuer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
 
(iv)Assignment and Acceptance. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment) and the assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
 
(v)No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to (A) Borrower or any of Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute a Defaulting Lender or a Subsidiary thereof.
 
(vi)No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person).
 
(vii)Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Revolving Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and each Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Revolving Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under 
 




 

110

 



739016937 20664705

 

 


 
 

 
applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.10(f), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 11.4 and 11.13 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 11.9.
 
(e)Register. Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Chicago, Illinois, a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amounts of the Revolving Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and Borrower, Administrative Agent, and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(f)Any Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or grant to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or grant of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or grant of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or secured party for such Lender as a party hereto; provided further, however, the right of any such pledgee or grantee (other than any Federal Reserve Bank) to further transfer all or any portion of the rights pledged or granted to it, whether by means of foreclosure or otherwise, shall be at all times subject to the terms of this Agreement.
 
Section 11.11 Amendments. Subject to Section 3.9, any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by (a) Borrower and (b) the Required Lenders (or by Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders), and each such amendment or waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided that no such amendment or waiver shall:
 
(i)extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender (it being understood that a waiver of any condition precedent set forth in Article IV or the waiver of any Default shall not constitute an extension or increase of the Commitment of any Lender);

(ii)reduce the principal of, or rate of interest specified herein on, any Revolving Loan or any unpaid Reimbursement Obligations, or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (provided that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary (x) to amend the definition of “Default Rate” or to waive the obligation of Borrower to pay interest at the Default Rate or (y) to amend any financial covenant (or any defined term directly or indirectly used therein), even if the effect of such amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any Revolving Loan or other Obligation or to reduce any fee payable hereunder);
 
(iii)postpone any date scheduled for any payment of principal of, or interest on, any Revolving Loan or any Reimbursement Obligation, or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby;
 
(iv)change Section 2.11 or Section 11.5 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby;
 
(v)waive any condition set forth in Section 4.1 without the written consent of each Lender;
 
(vi)change Section 2.2(b) in a manner that would permit the expiration date of any Letter of Credit to occur after the Commitment Termination Date without the consent of each Lender;
 
(vii)change any provision of this Section or the percentage in the definition of “Required Lenders” or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender;
 
(viii)subordinate the Obligations hereunder or the Liens granted hereunder or under the other  Loan  Documents,  to  any other  Indebtedness  or  Liens  (including,  without  limitations, Indebtedness issued under this Agreement or Liens granted under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents), as the case may be, without the prior written consent of each Lender; or
 
(ix)release all or substantially all of the Collateral, without the written consent of each Lender; or
 
(x)release the Guarantors from their Obligations under the Guaranty (other than in connection with any transaction permitted under the Loan Documents), without the written consent of each Lender;
 
provided, further, that no such amendment or waiver shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties hereunder or under any other Loan Document of (A) the Administrative Agent, unless in writing executed by the Administrative Agent and (B) the L/C Issuer, unless in writing executed by the L/C Issuer.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent that by its terms requires the consent of all the Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected

with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders, except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended, or the maturity of any of its Revolving Loan may not be extended, the rate of interest on any of its Revolving Loans may not be reduced and the principal amount of any of its Revolving Loans may not be forgiven, in each case without the consent of such Defaulting Lender and (y) any amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of all the Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than the other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.
 
In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, if the Administrative Agent and Borrower shall have jointly identified an obvious error or any error or omission of a technical nature, in each case, in any provision of the Loan Documents, then the Administrative Agent and Borrower shall be permitted to amend such provision, and, in each case, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Loan Document if the same is not objected to in writing by the Required Lenders to the Administrative Agent within ten Business Days following receipt of notice thereof.
 
Section 11.12Headings. Section headings used in this Agreement are for reference only and shall not affect the construction of this Agreement.
 
Section 11.13Costs and Expenses; Indemnification. (a) Each Loan Party agrees to pay all reasonable and invoiced costs and expenses actually incurred by Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, syndication, and administration of the Loan Documents, including the reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of counsel to Administrative Agent (provided that attorneys’ fees, charges and disbursements shall be limited to (i) one outside counsel for the Administrative Agent and (ii) one local counsel in each separate relevant jurisdiction), in connection with the preparation and execution of the Loan Documents and in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and any amendment, waiver  or  consent  related  thereto,  whether  or  not  the  transactions  contemplated  herein  are consummated, together with any fees and charges suffered or incurred by Administrative Agent in connection with periodic environmental audits, fixed asset appraisals, title insurance policies, collateral filing fees and lien searches. Each Loan Party agrees to pay to Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and each Lender, and any other holder of any Obligations outstanding hereunder, all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred or paid by Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, such Lender, or any such holder, including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees (provided that attorneys’ fees, charges and disbursements shall be limited to (i) one outside counsel for Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer Bank or any Lender (and, in the case of an actual conflict of interest, one additional counsel to all such persons similarly situated) and (ii) one local counsel in each separate relevant jurisdiction) and disbursements and court costs, in connection with any Default or Event of Default hereunder or in connection with the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents (including all such costs and expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy Code involving Borrower, any other Loan Party or any Guarantor as a debtor thereunder). Each Loan Party further agrees to indemnify Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, each Lender, each lead arranger and any security trustee therefor, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including all reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of counsel for any such Indemnitee and all reasonable expenses of litigation or preparation therefor, whether or not the Indemnitee is a party thereto, or any settlement arrangement

Each Loan Party, upon demand by Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or a Lender at any time, shall reimburse Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender for any legal or other expenses (including all reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for any such Indemnitee) incurred in connection with investigating or defending against any of the foregoing (including any settlement costs relating to the foregoing) except to the extent that the same are determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from (i) the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, or (ii) any dispute solely among Indemnitees which does not arise out of any act or omission of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries. The Borrower shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding giving rise to indemnified liabilities effected by any indemnified party without the Borrower’s consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), but if any such proceeding is settled with the Borrower’s written consent, or if there is a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in any such proceeding, the Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified person in the manner set forth above. The Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of the affected indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding against any indemnified party in respect of which indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (a) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability or claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (b) does not include any statement as to any admission of fault or culpability. This Section 11.13 shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.
 
(b)Each Loan Party unconditionally agrees to forever indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and covenants not to sue for any claim for contribution against, each Indemnitee for any damages, costs, loss or expense, including response, remedial or removal costs and all fees a

(c)To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the parties to this Agreement shall assert, and each such Person hereby waives, any claim against the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, any Lender or lead arranger or any other Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,

None of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender or lead arranger shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under the Loan Documents or applicable Law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, with the prior written consent of Administrative Agent, each Lender, the L/C Issuer, each subsequent holder of any Obligation, and each of their respective affiliates, is hereby authorized by Borrower, each Loan Party and each Guarantor at any time or from time to time, without notice to Borrower, any other Loan Party or any Guarantor or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including, but not limited to, indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, and in whatever currency denominated, but not including trust accounts) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by that Lender, L/C Issuer, subsequent holder, or affiliate, to or for the credit or the account of Borrower, any such Loan Party or any such Guarantor, whether or not matured, against and on account of the Obligations, Hedging Liability and Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability of Borrower, any such Loan Party or any such Guarantor to that Lender, L/C Issuer, or subsequent holder under the Loan Documents, including, but not limited to, all claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not (a) that Lender, L/C Issuer, or subsequent holder shall have made any demand hereunder or (b) the principal of or the interest on the Revolving Loans and other amounts due hereunder shall have become due and payable pursuant to Section 8 and although said obligations and liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured.
 
Section 11.15Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents constitute the entire understanding of the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof and any prior agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto are superseded hereby.
 
Section 11.16Governing Law. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents (except as otherwise specified therein), and any claim, controversy, dispute or cause of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Loan Document, and the rights and duties of the parties hereto, shall be governed by and construed and determined in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New

controlling and to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement or the other Loan Documents invalid or unenforceable.
 
Section 11.18Excess Interest. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, no such provision shall require the payment or permit the collection of any amount of interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted by applicable Law to be charged for the use or detention, or the forbearance in the collection, of all or any portion of the Revolving Loans or other obligations outstanding under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (“Excess Interest”). If any Excess Interest is provided for, or is adjudicated to be provided for, herein or in any other Loan Document, then in such event (a) the provisions of this Section shall govern and control, (b) neither Borrower, nor any other Loan Party. nor any Guarantor or endorser shall be obligated to pay any Excess Interest, (c) any Excess Interest that Administrative Agent or any Lender may have received hereunder shall, at the option of Administrative Agent, be (i) applied as a credit against the then outstanding principal amount of Obligations hereunder and accrued and unpaid interest thereon (not to exceed the maximum amount permitted by applicable Law), (ii) refunded to Borrower, or (iii) any combination of the foregoing, (d) the interest rate payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be automatically subject to reduction to the maximum lawful contract rate allowed under applicable usury laws (the “Maximum Rate”), and this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to have been, and shall be, reformed and modified to reflect such reduction in the relevant interest rate, and (e) neither Borrower, nor any Loan Party, nor any Guarantor or endorser shall have any action against Administrative Agent or any Lender for any damages whatsoever arising out of the payment or collection of any Excess Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any period of time interest on any of the Obligations is calculated at the Maximum Rate rather than the applicable rate under this Agreement, and thereafter such applicable rate becomes less than the Maximum Rate, the rate of interest payable on such Obligations shall remain at the Maximum Rate until the Lenders have received the amount of interest which such Lenders would have received during such period on such Obligations had the rate of interest not been limited to the Maximum Rate during such period.
 
Section 11.19Construction. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Loan Documents shall not be construed more favorably in favor of any party hereto based upon which party drafted the same, it being acknowledged that all parties hereto contributed substantially to the negotiation of the Loan Documents. The provisions of this Agreement relating to Subsidiaries shall only apply during such times as Borrower has one or more Subsidiaries. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed or construed to permit any act or omission which is prohibited by the terms of any Collateral Document, the covenants and agreements contained herein being in addition to and not in substitution for the covenants and agreements contained in the Collateral Documents.
 
Section 11.20Lender’s and L/C Issuer’s Obligations Several. The obligations of the Lenders and L/C Issuer hereunder are several and not joint. Nothing contained in this Agreement and no action taken by the Lenders or L/C Issuer pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute the Lenders and L/C Issuer a partnership, association, joint venture or other entity.
