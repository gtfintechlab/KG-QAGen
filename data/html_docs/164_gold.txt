Swing Line Loans shall not count as usage of the Aggregate Commitment for the purpose of calculating the commitment fee due hereunder. 2.6.    Minimum Amount of Each Advance.  Each Eurocurrency Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 and incremental amounts in integral multiples of $1,000,000, and each Base Rate Advance (other than an Advance to repay Swing Line Loans) shall be in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 and incremental amounts in integral multiples of $500,000, provided, however, that any Base Rate Advance may be in the amount of the Available Aggregate Commitment.2.7.    Reductions in Aggregate Commitment; Optional Principal Payments.  (a)    The Borrower may permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment, in whole or in part, ratably among the Lenders in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000, upon at least five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent by 3:00 p.m. (Chicago time) in the form of Exhibit C-3 (a “Payment Notice”), which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction, provided, however, that the amount of the Aggregate Commitment of the Lenders may not be reduced below the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure.  All accrued commitment fees shall be payable on the effective date of any termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Credit Extensions hereunder.  26(b)    The Borrower may from time to time pay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Base Rate Advances (other than Swing Line Loans), or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $1,000,000 and incremental amounts in integral multiples of $500,000 (or the aggregate amount of the outstanding Loans at such time), any portion of the aggregate outstanding Base Rate Advances (other than Swing Line Loans) upon same day notice by 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) to the Administrative Agent.

The Borrower may from time to time pay, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4 but without penalty or premium, all outstanding Eurocurrency Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 and incremental amounts in integral multiples of $1,000,000 (or the aggregate amount of the outstanding Revolving Loans at such time), any portion of the aggregate outstanding Eurocurrency Advances upon at least two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent by 3:00 p.m. (Chicago time).2.8.    Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New Advances.  The Borrower shall select the Type of Advance and, in the case of each Eurocurrency Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto from time to time.  The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice in the form of Exhibit C-1 (a “Borrowing Notice”) not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the Borrowing Date of each Base Rate Advance (other than a Swing Line Loan), and two (2) Business Days before the Borrowing Date for each Eurocurrency Advance, specifying:(i)    the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such Advance,(ii)    the aggregate amount of such Advance,(iii)    the Type of Advance selected,  and(iv)    in the case of each Eurocurrency Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto.Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such Advance. Not later than 12:00 noon (Chicago time) on each Borrowing Date (or, if a Lender receives such advice from the Administrative Agent after 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on such Business Day in the case of Base Rate Advances, within two hours after receiving such notice), each Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII.  The Administrative Agent will promptly make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the Borrower at the Administrative Agent’s aforesaid address.2.9.    Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances; Maximum Number of Interest Periods.  Base Rate Advances (other than Swing Line Loans) shall continue as Base Rate Advances unless and until such Base Rate Advances are converted into Eurocurrency Advances pursuant to this Section 2.9 or are repaid in accordance with Section 2.7.  Each Eurocurrency Advance shall continue as a Eurocurrency Advance until the end of the then applicable Interest 27Period therefor, at which time such Eurocurrency Advance shall be automatically converted into a Base Rate Advance unless (x) such Eurocurrency Advance is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.7 or (y) the Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice (as defined below) requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurocurrency Advance continue as a Eurocurrency Advance for the same or another Interest Period

tice in the form of Exhibit C-2 (a “Conversion/Continuation Notice”) of each conversion of a Base Rate Advance into a Eurocurrency Advance, conversion of a Eurocurrency Advance to a Base Rate Advance, or continuation of a Eurocurrency Advance not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date of the requested conversion or continuation, specifying:(i)    the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such conversion or continuation,(ii)    the Type of the Advance which is to be converted or continued, and(iii)    the amount of such Advance which is to be converted into or continued as a Eurocurrency Advance and the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto.After giving effect to all Advances, all conversions of Advances from one Type to another and all continuations of Advances of the same Type, there shall be no more than five (5) Interest Periods in effect hereunder.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Lender may exchange, continue or roll over all or a portion of its Loans in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Lender.2.10.    Interest Rates.  Each Base Rate Advance (other than a Swing Line Loan) shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance is made or is automatically converted from a Eurocurrency Advance into a Base Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.9, to but excluding the date it becomes due or is converted into a Eurocurrency Advance pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate for such day; provided, that if a Base Rate Advance is due as a result of an Event of Default or is otherwise outstanding during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Base Rate shall continue to apply thereto plus such other amounts as required under Section 2.11.  Each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the day such Swing Line Loan is made to but excluding the date it is paid, at a rate per annum equal to, at the Borrower’s option, the Base Rate for such day or the Daily Eurocurrency Rate.  Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained as a Base Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate.  Each Eurocurrency Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at the interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent as applicable to such Eurocurrency Advance 28based upon the Borrower’s selections under Sections 2.8 and 2.9 and the definition of Applicable Margin.  No Interest Period may end after the Facility Termination Date.2.11.    Rates Applicable After Event of Default.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 2.8, 2.9 or 2.10, during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice from the Administrative Agent to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.3 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that no Advance may be made as, converted into or continued as a Eurocurrency Advance.  During the continuance of an Event of Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice from the Administrative Agent to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.3 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), (i) declare that each Eurocurrency Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 2.00% per annum, (ii) each Base Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus 2.00% per annum, and (iii) the LC Fee shall be increased by 2.00% per annum, provided that, during the continuance of an Event of Default under Sections 7.6 or 7.7, the interest rates set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above and the increase in the LC Fee set forth in clause (iii) above shall be applicable automatically to all Credit Extensions without any election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.  After an Event of Default has been waived, the interest rate applicable to advances and the LC Fee shall revert to the rates applicable prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default.2.12.    Method of Payment.  Each Advance shall be repaid and each payment of interest thereon shall be paid in Dollars.  All payments of the Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s address specified pursuant to Article XIII, or at any other Lending Installation of the Administrative Agent specified in writing by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, by 12:00 noon (Chicago time) on the date when due and shall (except (i) with respect to repayments of Swing Line Loans, (ii) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations for which the LC Issuer has not been fully indemnified by the Lenders, or (iii) as otherwise specifically required hereunder) be applied ratably by the Administrative Agent among the Lenders.  Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Administrative Agent from such Lender.  The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account of the Borrower maintained with U.S. Bank for each payment of principal, interest, Reimbursement Obligations and fees as it becomes due hereunder.  Each reference to the Administrative Agent in this Section 2.12 shall also be deemed to refer, and shall apply equally, to the LC Issuer, in the case of payments required to be made by the Borrower to the LC Issuer pursuant to Section 2.19(f).2.13.    Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness.  %4.  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of the 29Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.(a)    The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder and Type thereof and the Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, (iii) the original stated amount of each Facility LC and the amount of LC Obligations outstanding at any time, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender’s share thereof.(b)    The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms.(c)    Any Lender (including the Swing Line Lender) may request that its Loans be evidenced by a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit D (with appropriate changes for notes evidencing Swing Line Loans) (each a “Note”).  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender such Note or Notes payable to the order of such Lender in a form supplied by the Administrative Agent.2.14.    Telephonic Notices.  The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of Types of Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any Person or Persons the Administrative Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices, Swing Line Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation Notices to be given telephonically.  The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a written confirmation (which may include e-mail) of each telephonic notice authenticated by an Authorized Officer. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.  The parties agree to prepare appropriate documentation to correct any such error within ten (10) days after discovery by any party to this Agreement.2.15.    Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis.  Interest accrued on each Base Rate Advance and each Swing Line Loan shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such Payment Date to occur after the date hereof and at maturity.  Interest accrued on each Eurocurrency Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurocurrency Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity.  Interest accrued on each Eurocurrency Advance having an Interest Period longer than three (3) months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period.  Interest accrued pursuant to Section 2.11 shall be payable on demand.  Interest on all Advances and fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365/366-day year.  Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance 30is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to 12:00 noon (Chicago time) at the place of payment.  If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day (other than a Payment Date) which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day.2.16.    Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment Reductions.  Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Swing Line Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder.  Promptly after notice from the LC Issuer, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each request for issuance of a Facility LC hereunder.  The Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Eurocurrency Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.2.17.    Lending Installations.  Each Lender may book its Advances and its participation in any LC Obligations and the LC Issuer may book the Facility LCs at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender or the LC Issuer, as the case may be, and may change its Lending Installation from time to time.  All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans, Facility LCs, participations in LC Obligations and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender or the LC Issuer, as the case may be, for the benefit of any such Lending Installation.  Each Lender and the LC Issuer may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in accordance with Article XIII, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by it or Facility LCs will be issued by it and for whose account Loan payments or payments with respect to Facility LCs are to be made.2.18.    Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.  Unless the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made.  The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption.  If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (y) in the case of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.312.19.    Facility LCs.(a)    Issuance.  The LC Issuer hereby agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to issue standby letters of credit denominated in Dollars (each, a “Facility LC”) and to renew, extend, increase, decrease or otherwise modify each Facility LC (“Modify,” and each such action a “Modification”), from time to time from and including the date of this Agreement and prior to the Facility Termination Date upon the request of the Borrower; provided that immediately after each such Facility LC is issued or Modified, (i) the aggregate amount of the outstanding LC Obligations shall not exceed $50,000,000, and (ii) the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitment.  No Facility LC shall have an expiry date later than the earlier to occur of (x) the fifth Business Day prior to the Facility Termination Date and (y) one (1) year after its issuance; provided, however, that the expiry date of a Facility LC may be up to one (1) year later than the fifth Business Day prior to the Facility Termination Date if the Borrower has posted on or before the fifth Business Day prior to the Facility Termination Date cash collateral in the Facility LC Collateral Account on terms satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to 105% of the LC Obligations with respect to such Facility LC.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the LC Issuer shall have no obligation hereunder to issue any Facility LC the proceeds of which would be made available to any Person (i) to fund any activity or business of, with, or for the benefit of any Sanctioned Person, or in any country or territory that, at the time of such funding, is the subject of any Sanctions, except to the extent permissible for a Person organized under the Laws of the United States of America or a political subdivision thereof, or otherwise constituting a citizen thereof, or (ii) in any manner that would result in a violation of any Sanctions by any party to this Agreement.  (b)    Participations.  Upon the issuance or Modification by the LC Issuer of a Facility LC, the LC Issuer shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably sold to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from the LC Issuer, a participation in such Facility LC (and each Modification thereof) and the related LC Obligations in proportion to its Pro Rata Share.(c)    Notice.  Subject to Section 2.19(a), the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice prior to 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least five (5) Business Days prior to the proposed date of issuance or Modification of each Facility LC, specifying the beneficiary, the proposed date of issuance (or Modification) and the expiry date of such Facility LC, and describing the proposed terms of such Facility LC and the nature of the transactions proposed to be supported thereby.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the LC Issuer and each Lender of the contents thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s participation in such proposed Facility LC.  The issuance or Modification by the LC Issuer of any Facility LC shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth in Article IV, be subject to the conditions precedent that such Facility LC shall be reasonably satisfactory to the LC Issuer and that the Borrower shall have executed and delivered such application agreement and/or such other instruments and agreements relating to such Facility LC as the LC Issuer shall have reasonably requested (each, a “Facility LC Application”).  The LC Issuer shall have no independent duty to ascertain whether the conditions set forth in Article IV have been satisfied; 32provided, however, that the LC Issuer shall not issue a Facility LC if, on or before the proposed date of issuance, the LC Issuer shall have received notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders that any such condition has not been satisfied or waived.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Facility LC Application, the terms of this Agreement shall control.(d)    LC Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, with respect to each Facility LC, a letter of credit fee at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Loans in effect from time to time on the average daily undrawn stated amount under such Facility LC, such fee to be payable in arrears on each Payment Date (the “LC Fee”).  The Borrower shall also pay to the LC Issuer for its own account (x) a fronting fee in an amount equal to 0.125% per annum of the average daily undrawn stated amount under such Facility LC, such fee to be payable in arrears on each Payment Date and (y) on demand, all amendment, drawing and other fees regularly charged by the LC Issuer to its letter of credit customers and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the LC Issuer in connection with the issuance, Modification, administration or payment of any Facility LC.(e)    Administration; Reimbursement by Lenders.  Upon receipt of any demand for payment under any Facility LC from the beneficiary of such Facility LC, the LC Issuer shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and each other Lender as to the amount to be paid by the LC Issuer as a result of such demand and the proposed payment date (the “LC Payment Date”).  The responsibility of the LC Issuer to the Borrower and each Lender shall be only to determine that the documents (including each demand for payment) delivered under each Facility LC in connection with such presentment shall be in conformity in all material respects with such Facility LC.  The LC Issuer shall endeavor to exercise the same care in the issuance and administration of the Facility LCs as it does with respect to letters of credit in which no participations are granted, it being understood that in the absence of any gross negligence or willful misconduct by the LC Issuer, each Lender shall be unconditionally and irrevocably liable without regard to the occurrence of any Event of Default or any condition precedent whatsoever, to reimburse the LC Issuer on demand for (i) such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the amount of each payment made by the LC Issuer under each Facility LC to the extent such amount is not reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19(f) below and there are not funds available in the Facility LC Collateral Account to cover the same, plus (ii) interest on the foregoing amount to be reimbursed by such Lender, for each day from the date of the LC Issuer’s demand for such reimbursement (or, if such demand is made after 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on such date, from the next succeeding Business Day) to the date on which such Lender pays the amount to be reimbursed by it at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.(f)    Reimbursement by Borrower.  The Borrower shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to reimburse the LC Issuer on or before the applicable LC Payment Date for any amounts to be paid by the LC Issuer upon any drawing under any Facility LC, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind; provided that neither the Borrower nor any Lender shall hereby be precluded from asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered by the Borrower or such Lender to the extent, but only to the 33extent, caused by (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the LC Issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC issued by it complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (ii) the LC Issuer’s failure to pay under any Facility LC issued by it after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Facility LC.  All such amounts paid by the LC Issuer and remaining unpaid by the Borrower shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to (x) the rate applicable to Base Rate Advances for such day if such day falls on or before the applicable LC Payment Date and (y) the sum of 2.00% per annum plus the rate applicable to Base Rate Advances for such day if such day falls after such LC Payment Date.  The LC Issuer will pay to each Lender ratably in accordance with its Pro Rata Share all amounts received by it from the Borrower for application in payment, in whole or in part, of the Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any Facility LC issued by the LC Issuer, but only to the extent such Lender has made payment to the LC Issuer in respect of such Facility LC pursuant to Section 2.19(e).  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the submission of a Swing Line Borrowing Notice or Borrowing Notice in compliance with Section 2.4 or Section 2.8, respectively, and the satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article IV), the Borrower may request an Advance hereunder for the purpose of satisfying any Reimbursement Obligation.(g)    Obligations Absolute.  The Borrower’s obligations under this Section 2.19 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have had against the LC Issuer, any Lender or any beneficiary of a Facility LC.  The Borrower further agrees with the LC Issuer and the Lenders that the LC Issuer and the Lenders shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower’s Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any Facility LC shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower, any of its Affiliates, the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any financing institution or other party to whom any Facility LC may be transferred or any claims or defenses whatsoever of the Borrower or of any of its Affiliates against the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any such transferee.  The LC Issuer shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Facility LC.  The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the LC Issuer or any Lender under or in connection with each Facility LC and the related drafts and documents, if done without gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon the Borrower and shall not put the LC Issuer or any Lender under any liability to the Borrower.  Nothing in this Section 2.19(g) is intended to limit the right of the Borrower to make a claim against the LC Issuer for damages as contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.19(f).(h)    Actions of LC Issuer.  The LC Issuer shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Facility LC, draft, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, facsimile, or electronic mail message, statement, order or other document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the LC Issuer.  The LC Issuer shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall first have received 34such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it reasonably deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.19, the LC Issuer shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and any future holders of a participation in any Facility LC.(i)    Indemnification.  The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, the LC Issuer and the Administrative Agent, and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees from and against any and all claims and damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements) which such Lender, the LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent may incur (or which may be claimed against such Lender, the LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent by any Person whatsoever) by reason of or in connection with the issuance, execution and delivery or transfer of or payment or failure to pay under any Facility LC or any actual or proposed use of any Facility LC, including any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements) which the LC Issuer may incur (i) by reason of or in connection with the failure of any other Lender to fulfill or comply with its obligations to the LC Issuer hereunder (but nothing herein contained shall affect any rights the Borrower may have against any Defaulting Lender) or (ii) by reason of or on account of the LC Issuer issuing any Facility LC which specifies that the term “Beneficiary” included therein includes any successor by operation of law of the named Beneficiary, but which Facility LC does not require that any drawing by any such successor Beneficiary be accompanied by a copy of a legal document, satisfactory to the LC Issuer, evidencing the appointment of such successor Beneficiary; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Lender, the LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (x) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the LC Issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (y) the LC Issuer’s failure to pay under any Facility LC after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Facility LC. Nothing in this Section 2.19(i) is intended to limit the obligations of the Borrower under any other provision of this Agreement.(j)    Lenders’ Indemnification.  Each Lender shall, ratably in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, indemnify the LC Issuer, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from such indemnitees’ gross negligence or willful misconduct or the LC Issuer’s failure to pay under any Facility LC after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Facility LC) that such indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this Section 2.19 or any action taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder.(k)    Facility LC Collateral Account.  If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or if required pursuant to Section 2.22(d), the Borrower agrees that it will, upon the 35request of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders and until the final expiration date of any Facility LC and thereafter as long as any amount is payable to the LC Issuer or the Lenders in respect of any Facility LC, maintain a special collateral account pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (the “Facility LC Collateral Account”), in the name of such Borrower but under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and in which such Borrower shall have no interest other than as set forth in Section 8.1.  The Borrower hereby pledges, assigns and grants to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of and for the ratable benefit of the Lenders and the LC Issuer, a security interest in all of the Borrower’s right, title and interest in and to all funds which may from time to time be on deposit in the Facility LC Collateral Account to secure the prompt and complete payment and performance of the Obligations.  The Administrative Agent will invest any funds on deposit from time to time in the Facility LC Collateral Account in certificates of deposit of U.S. Bank having a maturity not exceeding thirty (30) days.  Nothing in this Section 2.19(k) shall either obligate the Administrative Agent to require the Borrower to deposit any funds in the Facility LC Collateral Account or limit the right of the Administrative Agent to release any funds held in the Facility LC Collateral Account in each case other than as required by Section 2.22 or Section 8.1.(l)    Rights as a Lender.  In its capacity as a Lender, the LC Issuer shall have the same rights and obligations as any other Lender.(m)    Separate Reimbursement Agreement.  In the event the LC Issuer enters into a separate reimbursement agreement with the Borrower covering the Facility LCs and the terms of such reimbursement agreement conflict with or contradict the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.2.20.    Replacement of Lender.  If the Borrower is required pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any Lender’s obligation to make or continue, or to convert Base Rate Advances into, Eurocurrency Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to make a Loan, reimburse the LC Issuer pursuant to Section 2.19(e) or the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.4(d) or declines to approve an amendment or waiver that is approved by the Required Lenders or otherwise becomes a Defaulting Lender (any Lender so affected an “Affected Lender”), the Borrower may elect, if the issue or event causing such Lender to be an Affected Lender is still effective, to replace such Affected Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement (except in the case of a Lender’s failure to approve an amendment or waiver that would cure any Default or Event of Default), and provided further that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and, to the Borrower’s and the Administrative Agent’s reasonable satisfaction, which other bank or entity does not suffer from and is not impacted by the issue or event causing the replacement of the Affected Lender, shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash at par the Advances and other Obligations due to the Affected Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents pursuant to an assignment substantially in the form of Exhibit B and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of Section 12.3 applicable to assignments, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such 36Affected Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (A) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including payments due to such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5, and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 3.4 had the Loans of such Affected Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender.  Each party hereto agrees that (i) an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an assignment and assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee, and (ii) the Affected Lender need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment and assumption to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound by the terms thereof, provided that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.2.21.    Limitation of Interest.  The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders intend to strictly comply with all applicable Laws, including applicable usury laws.  Accordingly, the provisions of this Section 2.21 shall govern and control over every other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document which conflicts or is inconsistent with this Section 2.21, even if such provision declares that it controls.  As used in this Section 2.21, the term “interest” includes the aggregate of all charges, fees, benefits or other compensation which constitute interest under applicable Law, provided that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) any non-principal payment shall be characterized as an expense or as compensation for something other than the use, forbearance or detention of money and not as interest, and (b) all interest at any time contracted for, reserved, charged or received shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread, in equal parts during the full term of this Agreement.  In no event shall the Borrower or any other Person be obligated to pay, or any Lender have any right or privilege to reserve, receive or retain, (a) any interest in excess of the maximum amount of nonusurious interest permitted under the applicable Laws (if any) of the United States or of any applicable state, or (b) total interest in excess of the amount which such Lender could lawfully have contracted for, reserved, received, retained or charged had the interest been calculated for the full term of this Agreement at the Highest Lawful Rate.  On each day, if any, that the interest rate (the “Stated Rate”) called for under this Agreement or any other Loan Document exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate at which interest shall accrue shall automatically be fixed by operation of this sentence at the Highest Lawful Rate for that day, and shall remain fixed at the Highest Lawful Rate for each day thereafter until the total amount of interest accrued equals the total amount of interest which would have accrued if there were no such ceiling rate as is imposed by this sentence.  Thereafter, interest shall accrue at the Stated Rate unless and until the Stated Rate again exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate when the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall again automatically operate to limit the interest accrual rate.  The daily interest rates to be used in calculating interest at the Highest Lawful Rate shall be determined by dividing the applicable Highest Lawful Rate per annum by the number of days in the calendar year for which such calculation is being made.  None of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document which directly or indirectly relate to interest shall ever be construed without reference to this Section 2.21, or be construed to create a contract to pay for the use, forbearance or detention of money at an interest rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate.  If the term of any Loan or any other Obligation outstanding hereunder or under the other Loan Documents is shortened by reason of acceleration of maturity as a result of any Event of Default or by any other cause, or by reason of any required or permitted prepayment, 37and if for that (or any other) reason any Lender at any time, including the stated maturity, is owed or receives (and/or has received) interest in excess of interest calculated at the Highest Lawful Rate, then and in any such event all of any such excess interest shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration, prepayment or other event which produces the excess, and, if such excess interest has been paid to such Lender, it shall be credited pro tanto against the then-outstanding principal balance of the Borrower’s Obligations to such Lender, effective as of the date or dates when the event occurs which causes it to be excess interest, until such excess is exhausted or all of such principal has been fully paid and satisfied, whichever occurs first, and any remaining balance of such excess shall be promptly refunded to its payor.  2.22.    Defaulting Lenders.(a)    Defaulting Lender Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:(i)Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders; provided, that any amendment, waiver or consent (x) that increases or extends the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender, or reduces, or extends the time for payment of, amounts owing to a Defaulting Lender (unless otherwise provided in this Agreement), shall in any case require the consent of such Defaulting Lender, and (y) requiring the consent of all the Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender disproportionately adversely relative to the other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.(ii)Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.1 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the LC Issuer and Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the LC Issuer’s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.22(d); fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account (including the Facility LC Collateral Account) and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the LC Issuer’s future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Facility LCs issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.22(d); sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the LC Issuer or Swing Line Lender as a result 38of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the LC Issuer or Swing Line Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement; eighth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent, distributed to the Lenders other than the Defaulting Lender until the ratio of the Outstanding Credit Exposures of such Lenders to the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure equals such ratio immediately prior to the Defaulting Lender’s failure to fund any portion of any Loans or participations in Facility LCs or Swing Line Loans; and ninth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or Facility LC issuances in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Facility LCs were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Credit Extensions of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Credit Extensions of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in LC Obligations and Swing Line Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments without giving effect to Section 2.22(a)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.22(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.(iii)Certain Fees. (A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commitment fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).  (B)    Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive LC Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its ratable share of the stated amount of Facility LCs for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.22(d).  (C)    With respect to any commitment fee or LC Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in LC Obligations or Swing Line Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to the LC Issuer and Swing Line Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to the LC Issuer’s or Swing Line Lender’s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.39(iv)Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure.  All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in LC Obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment.  Subject to Section 9.15, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.(v)Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Line Loans.  If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under Law, (x) first, prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lender’s Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the LC Issuer’s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.22(d).(b)    Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender and the LC Issuer agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Facility LCs and Swing Line Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.22(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.(c)    New Swing Line Loans/Facility LCs.  So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swing Line Lender shall not be required to fund any Swing Line Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swing Line Loan and (ii) the LC Issuer shall not be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Facility LC unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.(d)    Cash Collateral.  At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one (1) Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or the LC Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the LC Issuer’s 40Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.22(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.(i)Grant of Security Interest.  The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the LC Issuer, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lender’s obligation to fund participations in respect of LC Obligations, to be applied pursuant to clause (ii) below.  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuer as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).(ii)Application.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.22 in respect of Facility LCs shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender’s obligation to fund participations in respect of LC Obligations (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such Property as may otherwise be provided for herein.(iii)Termination of Requirement.  Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce the LC Issuer’s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.22(d) following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to this Section 2.22 the Person providing Cash Collateral and the LC Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.2.23.    Judgment Currency.  If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the “specified currency”) into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agent’s offices on the Business Day preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is given.  The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase 41the specified currency with such other currency.  If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 11.2, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower.2.24.    Extensions of Commitments.(a)     The Borrower may from time to time, pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.24, agree with one or more Lenders holding Commitments to extend the termination date, and otherwise modify the terms of such Commitments or any portion thereof (including by increasing the interest rate or fees payable in respect of such Commitments or any portion thereof) (each such modification, an "Extension") pursuant to one or more written offers (each, an "Extension Offer") made from time to time by the Borrower to all Lenders, in each case on a pro rata basis (based on their respective Pro Rata Shares) and on the same terms to each such Lender.  In connection with each Extension, the Borrower will provide notification to the Administrative Agent (for distribution to the Lenders), no later than thirty (30) days prior to the Facility Termination Date of the requested new termination date for the extended Commitments (each an "Extended Termination Date") and the due date for Lender responses.  In connection with any Extension, each Lender wishing to participate in such Extension shall, prior to such due date, provide the Administrative Agent with a written notice thereof in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.  Any Lender that does not respond to an Extension Offer by the applicable due date shall be deemed to have rejected such Extension.  (b)    Each Extension shall be subject to the following:(i)no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time any Extension Offer is delivered to the Lenders or at the time of such Extension;(ii)except as to interest rates, fees and termination date, the Commitment of any Lender extended pursuant to any Extension shall have the same terms as the Commitments of the Lenders that did not agree to the Extension Offer;(iii)the final termination date of the Commitments to be extended pursuant to an Extension shall be later than the final termination date of the Commitments of the Lenders that did not agree to the Extension Offer;(iv)if the aggregate amount of Commitments in respect of which Lenders shall have accepted an Extension Offer exceeds the maximum aggregate amount of Commitments offered to be extended by the Borrower pursuant to the relevant Extension Offer, then such Commitments shall be extended ratably up to such 42maximum amount based on the relative Commitments of the Lenders that accepted such Extension Offer;(v)all documentation in respect of such Extension shall be consistent with the foregoing, and all written communications by the Borrower generally directed to the applicable Lenders in connection therewith shall be in form and substance consistent with the foregoing and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent;(vi)any applicable Minimum Extension Condition shall be satisfied; and(vii)no Extension shall become effective unless, on the proposed effective date of such Extension, the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 shall be satisfied (with all references in such Section to a request for a Loan being deemed to be references to the Extension on the applicable date of such Extension), and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated the applicable date of such Extension and executed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower.(c)    [Reserved.](d)    The consummation and effectiveness of any Extension will be subject to a condition set forth in the relevant Extension Offer (a "Minimum Extension Condition") that a minimum amount be agreed to by the Lenders subject to such Extension (to be determined in the Borrower’s discretion and specified in the relevant Extension Offer, but in no event less than $100,000,000, unless another amount is agreed to by the Administrative Agent).  For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that the provisions of Section 11.2 will not apply to Extensions of Commitments pursuant to Extension Offers made pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.24, including to any payment of interest or fees in respect of any Commitments or Revolving Loans that have been extended or made pursuant to an Extension at a rate or rates different from those paid or payable in respect of Commitments or Revolving Loans of Lenders that did not extend their Commitments, in each case as is set forth in the relevant Extension Offer.(e)    The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into amendments (collectively, "Extension Amendments") to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary in order to establish new classes of Commitments and Revolving Loans created pursuant to an Extension, in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.24.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation) to seek the advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders with respect to any matter contemplated by this Section 2.24 and, if the Administrative Agent seeks such advice or concurrence, the Administrative Agent shall be permitted to enter into such amendments with the Borrower in accordance with any instructions received from such Required Lenders and shall also be entitled to refrain from entering into such amendments with the Borrower unless and until it shall have received such advice or concurrence; provided, however, that whether or not there has been a request by the Administrative Agent for any such advice or concurrence, all such Extension Amendments entered into with the Borrower by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be binding on the Lenders. Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with 43any Extension, the Borrower and any Subsidiary shall execute such agreements, confirmations or other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.24.   (f)    In connection with any Extension, the Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent at least ten (10) Business Days’ (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior written notice thereof, and shall agree to such procedures, if any, as may be reasonably established by, or acceptable to, the Administrative Agent to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.24.(g)    This Section 2.24 shall supersede any provision in Section 8.3 to the contrary.  2.25.    Increase Option.  The Borrower may from time to time until the Facility Termination Date elect to increase the Commitments in minimum increments of $25,000,000 or such lower amount as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree upon, so long as, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of such increases does not exceed $400,000,000.  The Borrower may arrange for any such increase to be provided by one or more Lenders (each Lender so agreeing to an increase in its Commitment, an “Increasing Lender”), or by one or more new banks, financial institutions or other entities that are Eligible Assignees (each such new bank, financial institution or other entity, an “Augmenting Lender”), to increase their existing Commitments, or extend Commitments, as the case may be; provided that (i) each Augmenting Lender and each Increasing Lender shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuer, in each case not to be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) (x) in the case of an Increasing Lender, the Borrower and such Increasing Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, and (y) in the case of an Augmenting Lender, the Borrower and such Augmenting Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto.  No consent of any Lender (other than the Lenders participating in the increase) shall be required for any increase in Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.25.  Increases and new Commitments created pursuant to this Section 2.25 shall become effective on the date agreed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders, and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender thereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Lender) shall become effective under this paragraph unless, (i) on the proposed date of the effectiveness of such increase, (A) the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.2 shall be satisfied or waived by the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower and (B) the Borrower shall be in compliance (on a pro forma basis reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) with the covenants contained in Section 6.20 and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents consistent with those delivered on the Effective Date as to the corporate power and authority of the Borrower to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase, as well as such documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request (including customary opinions of counsel, affirmations of Loan Documents and updated financial projections, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, demonstrating the Borrower’s anticipated compliance with Section 6.20 through the Facility Termination Date).  On the effective date of any increase in the Commitments, (i) each relevant Increasing Lender and Augmenting Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the 44Administrative Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other Lenders, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such increase and the use of such amounts to make payments to such other Lenders, each Lender’s portion of the outstanding Revolving Loans of all the Lenders to equal its Pro Rata Share of such outstanding Revolving Loans, and (ii) the Borrower shall be deemed to have repaid and reborrowed all outstanding Revolving Loans as of the date of any increase in the Commitments (with such reborrowing to consist of the Types of Revolving Loans, with related Interest Periods if applicable, specified in a notice delivered by the Borrower, in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.3).  The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and, in respect of each Eurocurrency Loan, shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.4 if the deemed payment occurs other than on the last day of the related Interest Periods.  Nothing contained in this Section 2.25 shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment on the part of any Lender to increase its Commitment hereunder at any time.This Section shall supersede any provision in Section 8.3 to the contrary. ARTICLE III YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES3.1.    Increased Costs.(a)     Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:(i)impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurocurrency Rate) or any LC Issuer;(ii)subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Excluded Taxes and (C) Other Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or(iii)impose on any Lender or any LC Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Facility LC;and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, such LC Issuer or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Facility LC (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Facility LC), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, LC Issuer or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, LC Issuer or other Recipient, the Borrower 45will pay to such Lender, LC Issuer or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, LC Issuer or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.(b)    Capital Requirements.  If any Lender or LC Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or LC Issuer or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Facility LCs or Swing Line Loans held by, such Lender, or the Facility LCs issued by any LC Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or LC Issuer or such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or LC Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or LC Issuer or such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.3.2.    Certificates for Reimbursement; Delay in Requests.  A certificate of a Lender or LC Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or LC Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Section 3.1 and delivered to the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or LC Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or LC Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to Section 3.1 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or LC Issuer pursuant to Section 3.1 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or LC Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).3.3.    Availability of Types of Advances; Adequacy of Interest Rate.  (a)    If the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine (i)that deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurocurrency Advances or Daily Eurocurrency Loans are not available to such Lenders in the relevant market, or(ii)that the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Advances or Daily Eurocurrency Loans is not ascertainable or does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurocurrency Advances or Daily Eurocurrency Loans, 46then the Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurocurrency Advances or Daily Eurocurrency Loans and require any affected Eurocurrency Advances or Daily Eurocurrency Loans to be repaid or converted to Base Rate Advances, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4.(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i) the circumstances set forth in Section 3.3(a)(ii) have arisen and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary, (ii) ICE Benchmark Administration (or any Person that takes over the administration of such rate) discontinues its administration an

 specific date after which such interest settlement rate shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall seek to jointly agree upon an alternate rate of interest to the Eurocurrency Base Rate and the Daily Eurocurrency Base Rate that gives due consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States at such time, and the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate rate of interest and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be applicable.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.3, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of the date notice of such alternate rate of interest is provided to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.  Until an alternate rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with this Section 3.3(b), (x) any request pursuant to Section 2.9 that requests the conversion of any Advance to, or continuation of any Advance as, a Eurocurrency Advance shall be ineffective and any such Advance shall be continued as or converted to, as the case may be, a Base Rate Advance, and (y) if any request pursuant to Section 2.8 requests a Eurocurrency Advance, such Advance shall be made as a Base Rate Advance.  If the alternate rate of interest determined pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement.3.4.    Funding Indemnification.  If (a) any payment of a Eurocurrency Advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, (b) a Eurocurrency Advance is not made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, (c) a Eurocurrency Loan is converted other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (d) the Borrower fails to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Advance on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto, or (e) any Eurocurrency Advance is assigned other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.20, the Borrower will indemnify each Lender for such Lender’s documented, actual out-of-pocket costs, expenses and Interest Differential (as determined by such Lender) incurred as a result of such prepayment.  The term “Interest Differential” shall mean that sum equal to the greater of zero or the financial loss incurred by the Lender resulting from prepayment, calculated as the difference between the amount of interest such Lender would have earned (from the investments in money 47markets as of the Borrowing Date of such Advance) had prepayment not occurred and the interest such Lender will actually earn (from like investments in money markets as of the date of prepayment) as a result of the redeployment of funds from the prepayment.  Because of the short-term nature of this facility, Borrower agrees that Interest Differential shall not be discounted to its present value.The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the Borrower shall be required to pay Interest Differential with respect to any portion of the principal balance paid or that becomes due before its scheduled due date, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, or otherwise, including any principal payment made following default, demand for payment, acceleration, collection proceedings, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings or otherwise.  Such prepayment fee shall at all times be an Obligation as well as an undertaking by the Borrower to the Lenders whether arising out of a voluntary or mandatory prepayment.3.5.    Taxes. (a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Law.  If any applicable Law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then the applicable Loan Party shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.5) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.(b)  The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.(c)  The Loan Parties shall indemnify such Recipient, within fifteen (15) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.5) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or LC Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or LC Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(d)  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within fifteen (15) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.2(c) relating to the 48maintenance of a Participant Register, and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (d).(e)  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.5, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.(f)(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.5(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(A) any Lender that is a United States Person for U.S. federal income Tax purposes shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding Tax; (B) any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:(1)  in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income Tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest 49under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such Tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such Tax treaty;(2)  executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;(3) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” related to the Borrower as described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or(4) to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, IRS Form W-8IMY or IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable.(C)  any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of 50this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.(iii)    Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.(g)    If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.5 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.5), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 3.5 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified pa

osed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.(h)    Each party’s obligations under this Section 3.5 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.(i)    For purposes of Section 3.5(d) and (f), the term “Lender” includes the LC Issuer.3.6.    Selection of Lending Installation; Mitigation Obligations; Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity.  To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Eurocurrency Loans or Daily Eurocurrency Loans (in the case of the Swing Line Lender) to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of Eurocurrency Advances or Daily Eurocurrency Loans under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender.  Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5.  Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error.  Determination of amounts payable under such Sections 51in connection with a Eurocurrency Loan or Daily Eurocurrency Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurocurrency Loan and the Swing Line Lender funded its Daily Eurocurrency Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurocurrency Rate or Daily Eurocurrency Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not.  Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower of such written statement.  The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.3.7.    Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain, or fund Advances whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower (through the Administrative Agent), (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Advances or to convert Base Rate Advances to Eurocurrency Advances shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Advances the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Advances of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurocurrency Advances of such Lender to Base Rate Advances (the interest rate on which Base Rate Advances of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Advances to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Advances and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.4.ARTICLE IVCONDITIONS PRECEDENT4.1.    Initial Credit Extension.

No delay or omission of the Lenders, the LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Event of Default or an acquiescence therein, and the making of a Credit Extension notwithstanding the existence of an Event of Default or the inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Credit Extension shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence.  Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.3, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth.

The Administrative Agent agrees to act as such contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article X.  Notwithstanding the use of the defined term “Administrative Agent,” it is expressly understood and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall not have any fiduciary responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and that the Administrative Agent is merely acting as the contractual representative of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  In its capacity as the Lenders’ contractual representative, the Administrative Agent (i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary duties to any of the Lenders, and (ii) is acting as an independent contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Each of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against the Administrative Agent on any agency theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of which claims each Lender hereby waives.10.2.    Powers.  The Administrative Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents to be taken by the Administrative Agent.10.3.    General Immunity.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, the Lenders or any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except to the extent such action or inaction is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.10.4.    No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any borrowing hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV, except receipt of items required to be delivered solely to the Administrative Agent; (d) the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default; (e) the validity, 81enforceability, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; (f) the value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of any Lien in any collateral security; or (g) the financial condition of the Borrower or any guarantor of any of the Obligations or of any of the Borrower’s or any such guarantor’s respective Subsidiaries.10.5.    Action on Instructions of Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders.  The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  The Administrative Agent may, at any time, request instructions from the Required Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which, by the terms of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent is permitted or required to take or to grant without consent or approval from the Required Lenders, and if such instructions are promptly requested, the Administrative Agent will be absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any action or to withhold any approval under any of the Loan Documents and will not have any liability for refraining from taking any action or withholding any approval under any of the Loan Documents until it has received such instructions from the Required Lenders.10.6.    Employment of Administrative Agents and Counsel.  The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties as Administrative Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact.   The Administrative Agent will not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of agents or attorneys-in-fact.10.7.    Reliance on Documents; Counsel.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, facsimile, electronic mail message, statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons, and, in respect to legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent, which counsel may be employees of the Administrative Agent.

The Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent ratably in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares (determined without excluding the Defaulting Lenders) (i) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Administrative Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents (including for any expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with any dispute between the Administrative Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby (including for any such amounts incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in connection with any dispute between the Administrative Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other documents, provided that (i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent and (ii) any indemnification required pursuant to Section 3.5(d) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions thereof.  The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.10.9.    Notice of Event of Default.  The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default”.  In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders; provided that, except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.10.10.    Rights as a Lender.  In the event the Administrative Agent is a Lender, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, at any time when the Administrative Agent is a Lender, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.  The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person.10.11.    Lender Credit Decision, Legal Representation. 83(a)    Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any other Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Except for any notice, report, document or other information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent or any Arranger hereunder, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arrangers shall have any duty or responsibility (either initially or on a continuing basis) to provide any Lender with any notice, report, document, credit information or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any Arranger (whether or not in their respective capacity as Administrative Agent or any Arranger) or any of their Affiliates.(b)    Each Lender further acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to be represented by legal counsel in connection with its execution of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, that it has made its own evaluation of all applicable Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and that the counsel to the Administrative Agent represents only the Administrative Agent and not the Lenders in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.10.12.    Successor Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be effective upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent or, if no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed, thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its intention to resign.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint (with the consent of the Borrower as long as no Event of Default exists), on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent.  If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within fifteen (15) days after the resigning Administrative Agent’s giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning Administrative Agent may appoint (with the consent of the Borrower so long as no Event of Default exists), on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent.  Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Administrative Agent may at any time without the consent of the Borrower or any Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor Administrative Agent hereunder.  If the Administrative Agent has resigned and no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders.  No successor Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor Administrative Agent has accepted the appointment.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Administrative Agent.  Upon the effectiveness of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the resigning Administrative Agent 84shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the Loan Documents.  After the effectiveness of the resignation of an Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for the benefit of such Administrative Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.  In the event that there is a succe

e Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 10.12, then the term “Prime Rate” as used in this Agreement shall mean the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new Administrative Agent.10.13.    Administrative Agent and Arranger Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay certain fees to each of the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers pursuant to the following letter agreements (as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, collectively, the “Fee Letters”, and each a “Fee Letter”): (i) Fee Letter, dated as of February 10, 2020, by and between the Borrower and U.S. Bank; (ii) Fee Letter, dated as of February 10, 2020, by and among the Borrower, Regions Capital Markets, a division of Regions Bank and Regions Bank; and (iii) Fee Letter, dated as of February 10, 2020, by and among the Borrower, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. and Truist Bank.10.14.    Delegation to Affiliates.  The Borrower and the Lenders agree that the Administrative Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates.  Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate’s directors, officers, agents and employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other protective provisions to which the Administrative Agent is entitled under Articles IX and X.10.15.     Guarantor Releases.  The Lenders authorize the Administrative Agent to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Loan Documents if such Person is no longer required to be a Guarantor hereunder or if such Person is sold, transferred or assigned or ceases to be a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Borrower in accordance with and to the extent permitted by the terms of this Agreement. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent’s authority to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Loan Documents pursuant to the foregoing.  In each case as specified hereto, the Administrative Agent may (and each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrower’s expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release a Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.10.16.    Co-Syndication Agents, etc.  Neither any of the Lenders identified in this Agreement as a “co-agent” or a “book runner,” nor any Syndication Agent or any Arranger shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such.  Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender.  Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to such Lenders as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in Section 10.11.10.17.    No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility.  In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other 85modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, any Arranger and any book runner and the Lenders are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, any Arranger and any book runner and the Lenders, on the other hand, (B) the Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) each of the Administrative Agent, any Arranger and any book runner and the Lenders is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) neither the Administrative Agent, any Arranger and any book runner nor any Lender has any obligation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent, any Arranger and any book runner and each of the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent, any Arranger and any book runner nor any Lender has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or its Affiliates.  To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent, any Arranger and any book runner and each of the Lenders with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.10.18.    Certain ERISA Matters.

In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of Lenders under applicable Law, if Borrower becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, Borrower authorizes each Lender to offset and apply all deposits, credits and deposit accounts (including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) of the Borrower with such Lender or any Affiliate of such Lender toward the payment of the Obligations then due and owing to such Lender and regardless of the existence or adequacy of any collateral, guaranty or any other security, right or remedy available to such Lender or the Lenders; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.22 and, pending such payment, 87shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer, and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.11.2.    Ratable Payments.

ARTICLE XIII BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS12.1.    Successors and Assigns.  The terms and provisions of the Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents without the prior written consent of each Lender, (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section 12.3, and (iii) any transfer by participation must be made in compliance with Section 12.2.  Any attempted assignment or transfer by any party not made in compliance with this Section 12.1 shall be null and void, unless such attempted assignment or transfer is treated as a participation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of this Section 12.1 relates only to absolute assignments and this Section 12.1 does not prohibit assignments creating security interests, including (x) any pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank or (y) in the case of a Lender which is a Fund, any pledge or assignment of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to its trustee in support of its obligations to its trustee; provided, however, that no such pledge or assignment creating a security interest shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder unless and until the parties thereto have complied with the provisions of Section 12.3.

Any assignee of the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance of such assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents.  Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making 88such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder or assignee of the rights to such Loan.12.2.    Participations.(a)    Permitted Participants; Effect.  Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more entities (“Participants”) participating interests in any Outstanding Credit Exposure owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents.  In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender’s obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Outstanding Credit Exposure and the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.(b)    Voting Rights.  Each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents provided that each such Lender may agree in its participation agreement with its Participant that such Lender will not vote to approve any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Outstanding Credit Exposure or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which would require consent of all of the Lenders pursuant to the terms of Section 8.3 or of any other Loan Document.(c)    Benefit of Certain Provisions.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant.  The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.  The Borrower further agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 9.6 and 9.10 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.3, provided that (i) a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.1 or 3.2 than the Lender who sold the participating interest to such Participant would have received had it retained such interest for its own account, unless the sale of such interest to such Participant is made with the prior written consent of the Borrower, (ii) a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.5 than the Lender who sold the participating interest to such Participant would have received had it retained such interest for its own account (A) except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change in Law (or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority) that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation and (B), in the case of any Participant that would be a Non-U.S. 89Lender if it were a Lender, such Participant agrees to comply with the provisions of Section 3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.5(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender) and (iii) a Participant shall agree to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.20 and Section 3.6 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.20 with respect to any Participant.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in any Outstanding Credit Exposure, any Note, any Commitment or any other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any Outstanding Credit Exposure, any Note, any Commitment or any other obligations under the Loan Documents) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Outstanding Credit Exposure, any Note, any Commitment or any other obligations under the Loan Documents is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.12.3.    Assignments.(a)    Permitted Assignments.  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees (“Purchasers”) all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.  Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B or in such other form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent as may be agreed to by the parties thereto.  Each such assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund shall either be in an amount equal to the entire applicable Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure of the assigning Lender or (unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents) be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000.  The amount of the assignment shall be based on the Commitment or Outstanding Credit Exposure (if the Commitment has been terminated) subject to the assignment, determined as of the date of such assignment or as of the “Trade Date,” if the “Trade Date” is specified in the assignment.(b)    Consents.  The consent of the Borrower shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, provided that the consent of the Borrower shall not be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided further that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received notice thereof.  The consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.  The consent of 90each of the LC Issuer and the Swing Line Lender shall be required prior to an assignment of a Commitment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.  Any consent required under this Section 12.3(b) shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.(c)    Effect; Assignment Effective Date.  Upon (i) delivery to the Administrative Agent of an assignment, together with any consents required by Sections 12.3(a) and 12.3(b), and (ii) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Administrative Agent for processing such assignment (unless such fee is waived by the Administrative Agent), such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such assignment.  The assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure under the applicable assignment agreement constitutes “plan assets” as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be “plan assets” under ERISA.  On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party thereto, and the transferor Lender shall be released with respect to the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent.  In the case of an assignment covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of, and subject to, those provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents which survive payment of the Obligations and termination of the applicable agreement.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 12.3 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 12.2.  Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3(c), the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.(d)    Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United States of America, a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender, and participations of each Lender in Facility LCs, pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and each Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.e)    Dissemination of Information.  The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan 91Documents by operation of law (each a “Transferee”) and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender’s possession; provided that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.11 of this Agreement.(f)    Resignation as LC Issuer or Swing Line Lender after Assignment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time U.S. Bank or any other LC Issuer assigns all of its Commitments and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, (i) U.S. Bank or any other LC Issuer may, upon 30 days’ notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as LC Issuer and/or (ii) U.S. Bank or any other Swing Line Lender may, upon 30 days’ notice to the Borrower, resign as Swing Line Lender.  In the event of any such resignation as LC Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor LC Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of such LC Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be.  If U.S. Bank resigns as LC Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the LC Issuer hereunder with respect to all Facility LCs outstanding as of the effective time of its resignation as LC Issuer and all LC Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations pursuant to Section 2.19(b)).  If U.S. Bank resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective time of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.4(d).  Upon the appointment of a successor LC Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring LC Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, and (b) the successor LC Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Facility LCs, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to such LC Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of such LC Issuer with respect to such Facility LCs.
