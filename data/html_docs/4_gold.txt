Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such Test Period shall have made any Specified Transaction that
would have required adjustment pursuant to this Section 1.11, then such financial ratio or test (or Total Assets) shall be calculated to give pro forma effect thereto in accordance with this Section 1.11. 
(c) Whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a Specified Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a
responsible financial or accounting officer of the Borrower and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of run-rate cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies projected by the Borrower in good faith to be
realized as a result of specified actions taken, committed to be taken or expected to be taken (calculated on a pro forma basis as though such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies had been realized on the first day of such period
and as if such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies were realized during the entirety of such period and run-rate means the full recurring benefit for a period that is associated with any action taken, committed to be
taken or expected to be taken (including any savings expected to result from the elimination of a public targets compliance costs with public company requirements) net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such
actions, and any such adjustments shall be included in the initial pro forma calculations of such financial ratios or tests (and in respect of any subsequent pro forma calculations in which such Specified Transaction or cost savings, operating
expense reductions and synergies are given pro forma effect) and during any applicable subsequent Test Period) relating to such Specified Transaction; provided that (A) such amounts are reasonably identifiable and factually supportable
in the good faith judgment of the Borrower, (B) such actions are taken, committed to be taken or with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or are expected in good faith to be taken no later than eighteen (18) months after the
date of such Specified Transaction, (C) no amounts shall be added to the extent duplicative of any amounts that are otherwise added back in computing Consolidated EBITDA (or any other components thereof), whether through a pro forma adjustment
or otherwise, with respect to such period and (D) any increase to Consolidated EBITDA as a result of cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies pursuant to this Section 1.11(c) shall be subject to the limitation set forth in
the further proviso of clause (viii) of the definition of Consolidated EBITDA. 
  48 


(d) In the event that (w) the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs (including
by assumption or guarantees) or repays (including by redemption, repayment, retirement or extinguishment) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred or repaid under any revolving credit facility in the ordinary course of business for working
capital purposes) or (x) the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary issues, repurchases or redeems Disqualified Equity Interests, (i) during the applicable Test Period or (ii) subsequent to the end of the applicable Test Period and
prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made, then such financial ratio or test shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence, repurchase or repayment of Indebtedness, or such
issuance or redemption of Disqualified Equity Interests, in each case to the extent required, as if the same had occurred on the last day of the applicable Test Period (except in the case of the Interest Coverage Ratio (or similar ratio), in which
case such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, redemption, repayment, retirement or extinguishment of Indebtedness or such issuance, repurchase or redemption of Disqualified Equity Interests will be given effect as if the same had occurred on the
first day of the applicable Test Period).  (e) If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro
forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of the event for which the calculation of the Interest Coverage Ratio is made had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into
account any interest hedging arrangements applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower to be the rate of
interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a Eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or
other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Borrower or Restricted Subsidiary may designate. 
ARTICLE II 
The Commitments and Credit Extensions  Section 2.01. The Loans.  (a) The Term Borrowings.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Term Lender severally agrees to make to the Borrower a single loan denominated in Dollars in a principal amount equal to such Term Lenders Term Commitment on the Closing Date. Amounts
borrowed under this Section 2.01(a) and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. Term Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as further provided herein.  (b) The Revolving Credit Borrowings. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Revolving Credit Lender severally agrees to make loans denominated in Dollars to the Borrower (each
such loan, a Revolving Credit Loan) from time to time, on any Business Day from and including the Closing Date until the Maturity Date for the Revolving Credit Facility, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed at any
time outstanding the amount of such Revolving Credit Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment; provided that after giving effect to any Revolving Credit Borrowing, the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of any
Revolving Credit Lender, plus such Revolving Credit Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Revolving Credit Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all
Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Revolving Credit Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment. Within the limits of each Revolving Credit Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the
Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01(b), prepay under Section 2.06, and reborrow under this Section 2.01(b). Revolving Credit Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as further provided herein. 
Section 2.02. Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans. 
  49 


(a) Each Term Borrowing, each Revolving Credit Borrowing, each conversion of Term Loans
or Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be made upon the Borrowers irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be
received by the Administrative Agent not later than (i) 12:30 p.m. two (2) Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or any conversion of Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate
Loans, and (ii) 11:00 a.m. on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or conversion of any Eurocurrency Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans. Each telephonic notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must be confirmed
promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Committed Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be in
a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c) and 2.04(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole
multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Committed Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Term Borrowing, a Revolving Credit Borrowing, a conversion of Term Loans or Revolving
Credit Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of
Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans are to be converted, and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect
thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans shall be made as, or converted to,
Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion
to, or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month. 
(b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Pro
Rata Share of the applicable Class of Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or
continuation described in Section 2.02(a). In the case of each Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agents Office not later than
1:00 p.m., in each case on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01),
the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent with the
amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; provided that if, on the date the Committed Loan
Notice with respect to such Borrowing is given by the Borrower, there are Swing Line Loans or L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied, first, to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings,
second, to the payment in full of any such Swing Line Loans, and third, to the Borrower as provided above.  (c)
Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Loan unless the Borrower pays the amount due, if any, under Section 3.05 in
connection therewith. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may require by notice to the Borrower that no Loans may be converted to or continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans. 
(d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period
for Eurocurrency Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of the Eurocurrency Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in the Administrative Agents prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change. 
  50 


(e) After giving effect to all Term Borrowings, all Revolving Credit Borrowings, all
conversions of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten (10) Interest Periods in effect (or such greater
number as may be acceptable to the Administrative Agent); provided that after the establishment of any new Class of Loans pursuant to an Incremental Amendment (including for Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments), Refinancing Amendment or
Extension Amendment, the number of Interest Periods otherwise permitted by this Section 2.02(e) shall increase by three (3) Interest Periods for each applicable Class so established. 
(f) The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing. 
(g) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing, or in the case of any
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date of such Borrowing, that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of
such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with
paragraph (b) above, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds available, then, to the extent
that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, each of such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest
thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans
comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the foregoing. A certificate of the
Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.02(g) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent
for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative
Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such
payment to the Administrative Agent.  Section 2.03. Letters of Credit. 
(a) The Letter of Credit Commitment. (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) each L/C Issuer
agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Revolving Credit Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from and including the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit
Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars for the account of the Borrower (provided that any Letter of Credit may be for the benefit of any Subsidiary of the Borrower) and to amend or renew Letters of Credit
previously issued by it, in accordance with Section 2.03(b), and (2) to honor drafts under the Letters of Credit and (B) the Revolving Credit Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued pursuant to this
Section 2.03; provided that no L/C Issuer shall be obligated to make any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, and no Lender shall be obligated to participate in any Letter of Credit if as of the date of such L/C
Credit Extension, (x) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender would exceed such Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment or (y) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Within the
foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace
Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. Each Letter of Credit shall be in form reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.03(a)(i) to the contrary, Goldman
Sachs Bank USA shall not be obligated to issue any commercial or trade (as opposed to standby) Letter of Credit. 
  51 


(ii) An L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of
Credit if:  (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms
purport to enjoin or restrain such L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to such L/C Issuer or any directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such L/C
Issuer shall prohibit, or direct that such L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction,
reserve or capital requirement (for which such L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon such L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing
Date (for which such L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder);  (B) subject to
Section 2.03(b)(iii), the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months after the date of issuance or last renewal, unless (1) the Required Revolving Lenders and the applicable L/C Issuer have approved
such expiry date or (2) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations in respect of such requested Letter of Credit has been Cash Collateralized or back-stopped by a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to such L/C Issuer; 
(C) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless
(1) all the Revolving Credit Lenders and the applicable L/C Issuer have approved such expiry date or (2) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations in respect of such requested Letter of Credit has been Cash Collateralized or back-stopped
by a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to such L/C Issuer;  (D) the issuance of such Letter of Credit
would violate any Laws binding upon such L/C Issuer; or  (E) the Letter of Credit is in a currency other than
Dollars;  (F) the stated amount of each Letter of Credit shall be not less than $100,000 or such lesser amount
as is acceptable to the applicable L/C Issuer;  (G) any Revolving Credit Lender is a Defaulting Lender at such
time, unless such L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements reasonably satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate such L/C Issuers risk (after giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv)) with respect to the participation in Letters of
Credit by such Defaulting Lender, including by cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lenders Pro Rata Share of the L/C Obligations.  (iii) An L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) such L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under
the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.  (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit.  (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to an L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of
Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the relevant L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 12:30 p.m. at least three
(3) Business Days prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be; or, in each case, such later date and time as the relevant L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion. In the case of a
request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in 
  52 



form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the relevant L/C Issuer: (a) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (b) the amount
thereof; (c) the expiry date thereof; (d) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (e) if applicable, the purpose for which the Letter of Credit is to be issued; (f) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in
case of any drawing thereunder; (g) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (h) such other matters as the relevant L/C Issuer may reasonably request. In the case of a
request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the relevant L/C Issuer (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed
date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (4) such other matters as the relevant L/C Issuer may reasonably request. 
(ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the relevant L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative
Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, such L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Upon receipt by the
relevant L/C Issuer of confirmation from the Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such L/C Issuer shall, on the requested
date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the relevant L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lenders Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Letter of Credit.
 (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the relevant L/C Issuer shall agree
to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit); provided that any such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit must permit the relevant L/C Issuer to prevent any such
renewal at least once in each twelve month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Nonrenewal Notice Date) in each
such twelve month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the relevant L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the relevant L/C Issuer for any such
renewal. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the relevant L/C Issuer to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than
the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations in respect of such requested Letter of Credit has been Cash Collateralized or back-stopped by a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C
Issuer; provided that the relevant L/C Issuer shall not permit any such renewal if (A) the relevant L/C Issuer has determined that it would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its renewed form under the
terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section 2.03(a)(ii) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five (5) Business Days before the Nonrenewal Notice
Date from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Credit Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied. 
(iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect
thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the relevant L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
(c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations. 
(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the relevant L/C
Issuer shall notify promptly the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the second Business Day following any payment by an L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an Honor
Date), the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Issuer in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing, together with interest on the amount so paid or disbursed by such L/C Issuer, to the extent not reimbursed on the date of such
payment of disbursement. If the Borrower does not reimburse such L/C Issuer by such time, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Administrative Agent of the unreimbursed drawing and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of
the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed Amount), and the amount of such Appropriate Lenders Pro Rata Share thereof. In such

  53 



event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without
regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Appropriate Lenders and the conditions set
forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by an L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing;
provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.  (ii) Each Appropriate Lender (including any Appropriate Lender acting as an L/C Issuer) shall, regardless of whether the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 have been satisfied, upon any notice
pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer, in Dollars, at the Administrative Agents Office for payments in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of
the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Appropriate Lender that so makes funds available shall
be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the relevant L/C Issuer.  (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or
for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the relevant L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together
with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Appropriate Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in
respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03. 
(iv) Until each Appropriate Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the
relevant L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer. 
(v) Each Revolving Credit Lenders obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse an L/C Issuer for amounts
drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which
such Lender may have against the relevant L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, (C) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit,
(D) any draft or other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, or (E) any other occurrence,
event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that each Revolving Credit Lenders obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) (but, for avoidance of doubt, not its obligation to
pay Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(ii)), is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise
impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
(vi) If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer any
amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), such L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the
Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the relevant L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. 
  54 


(d) Repayment of Participations. (i) If, at any time after an L/C Issuer has
made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Credit Lender such Lenders L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such
L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent
will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lenders L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those
received by the Administrative Agent.  (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an L/C
Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Appropriate Lender
shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such
Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.  (e) Obligations Absolute. The
(i) obligation of the Borrower and (ii) the obligation of the Revolving Credit Lenders to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit issued by it and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; 
(ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that any Loan Party may have at any time against any
beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the relevant L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
(iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 
(iv) any payment by the relevant L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the relevant L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; 
(v) any exchange, release or nonperfection of any Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from the
Guaranty or any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations of any Loan Party in respect of such Letter of Credit;  (vi)
the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default; or  (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Loan Party;  provided that the foregoing shall not excuse any L/C Issuer from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are
waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable Law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such L/C Issuers gross negligence or willful misconduct when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter
of Credit comply with the terms thereof. 
  55 


(f) Role of L/C Issuers. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any
drawing under a Letter of Credit, the relevant L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any draft, demand, certificate or other document expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as
to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuers, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any
L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence
of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. The Borrower hereby assumes all
risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrowers pursuing such rights and remedies
as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuers, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any L/C Issuer, shall be liable or
responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 2.03(e); provided that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against an L/C Issuer, and such
L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by such L/C Issuers willful
misconduct or gross negligence or such L/C Issuers willful or grossly negligent failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a draft, demand, certificate or other document strictly complying with
the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit (in each case, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each L/C Issuer may accept documents
that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and no L/C Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument
transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. 
(g) Cash Collateral. (i) If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders, as applicable, require the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to Section 8.02(c) or (ii) an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(f) occurs and is continuing, then the Borrower shall Cash
Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount determined as of the date of such Event of Default), and shall do so not later than 2:00 p.m. on (x) in the case of the immediately
preceding clause (i), (1) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice thereof, if such notice is received on such day prior to 12:00 Noon, or (2) if clause (1) above does not apply, the Business Day immediately following the
day that the Borrower receives such notice and (y) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (ii), the Business Day on which an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(f) occurs or, if such day is not a Business Day, the
Business Day immediately succeeding such day. For purposes hereof, Cash Collateralize means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the relevant L/C Issuer and the Lenders, as
collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances (Cash Collateral) pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the relevant L/C Issuer (which
documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuers and the Lenders, a security interest in all such
cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked accounts at the Administrative Agent and may be invested in readily available Cash Equivalents. If at any time the
Administrative Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties) or that the total amount of such funds is less than the
aggregate Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the deposit accounts at the Administrative
Agent as aforesaid, an amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent reasonably determines to be free and clear of
any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under 
  56 



applicable Law, to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer. To the extent the amount of any Cash Collateral exceeds the then Outstanding Amount of such L/C Obligations and so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the excess shall be refunded to the Borrower. To the extent any Event of Default giving rise to the requirement to Cash Collateralize any Letter of Credit pursuant to this Section 2.03(g) is cured or
otherwise waived by the Required Lenders, then so long as no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all Cash Collateral pledged to Cash Collateralize such Letter of Credit shall be refunded to the Borrower. 
(h) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender in
accordance with its Pro Rata Share a Letter of Credit fee for each Letter of Credit issued pursuant to this Agreement equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily maximum amount then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit
(determined without regard to whether any conditions to drawing could then be met). Such Letter of Credit fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such Letter of Credit fees shall be due and payable in Dollars on the first Business
Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If there is any change in the
Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. 
(i) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuers. The Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer
for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by it equal to 0.125% per annum (or such other lower amount as may be mutually agreed by the Borrower and the applicable L/C Issuer) of the daily maximum amount
then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (determined without regard to whether any conditions to drawing could then be met). Such fronting fees shall be (x) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and (y) due and payable on
the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. In
addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as
from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable within ten (10) Business Days of demand and are nonrefundable.  (j) Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of
Credit Application, the terms hereof shall control.  (k) Addition of an L/C Issuer. A Revolving Credit Lender may
become an additional L/C Issuer hereunder pursuant to a written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Revolving Credit Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Credit Lenders of any such additional L/C
Issuer.  (l) Provisions Related to Extended Revolving Credit Commitments. If the Letter of Credit Expiration Date in
respect of any tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments occurs prior to the expiry date of any Letter of Credit, then (i) if consented to by the L/C Issuer which issued such Letter of Credit, if one or more other tranches of Revolving Credit
Commitments in respect of which the Letter of Credit Expiration Date shall not have so occurred are then in effect, such Letters of Credit for which consent has been obtained shall automatically be deemed to have been issued (including for purposes
of the obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders to purchase participations therein and to make Revolving Credit Loans and payments in respect thereof pursuant to Sections 2.03(c) and (d)) under (and ratably participated in by Revolving Credit
Lenders pursuant to) the Revolving Credit Commitments in respect of such non-terminating tranches up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of the unutilized Revolving Credit Commitments thereunder at such time (it being
understood that no partial face amount of any Letter of Credit may be so reallocated) and (ii) to the extent not reallocated pursuant to immediately preceding clause (i) and unless provisions reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C
Issuer for the treatment of such Letter of Credit as a letter of credit under a successor credit facility have been agreed upon, the Borrower shall, on or prior to the applicable Maturity Date, cause all such Letters of Credit to be replaced and
returned to the applicable L/C Issuer undrawn and marked cancelled or to the extent that the Borrower is unable to so replace and return any Letter(s) of Credit, such Letter(s) of Credit shall be secured by a back to back
letter of 
  57 



credit reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer or the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize any such Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 2.03(g). Commencing with the
Maturity Date of any tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments, the sublimit for Letters of Credit shall be agreed solely with the L/C Issuer.  (m) Applicability of ISP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the ISP shall apply to each Letter of Credit.
 Section 2.04. Swing Line Loans.  (a) The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender agrees to make loans (each such loan, a Swing Line Loan) to the
Borrower from time to time on any Business Day from and including the Closing Date until the Maturity Date for the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit,
notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such
Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment; provided that (i) after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of any Lender (other than the relevant Swing Line Lender solely in
its capacity as such), plus such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed
such Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, the Swing Line Lender shall not be obligated to make any Swing Line Loans at a time when a Revolving Credit Lender is a Defaulting Lender,
unless the Swing Line Lender has entered into arrangements reasonably satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate the Swing Line Lenders risk (after giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lenders
participation in such Swing Line Loans, including by cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lenders Pro Rata Share of the outstanding amount of Swing Line Loans; provided further that, the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any
Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.06, and reborrow under
this Section 2.04. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Swing Line Loans shall only be denominated in Dollars. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lenders Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Swing Line Loan. 
(b) Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon the Borrowers irrevocable notice to the Swing Line
Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the
amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by
delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Swing
Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the
Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Revolving Credit Lender) prior to
2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or
(B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in
such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower.  (c) Refinancing of Swing
Line Loans. (i) The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Credit
Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in 
  58 



writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and
multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the
Borrower with a copy of the applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Credit Lender shall make an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount specified in such
Committed Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agents Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Committed Loan Notice, whereupon,
subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing
Line Lender.  (ii) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Credit Borrowing in
accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Revolving Credit Lenders fund its risk
participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Revolving Credit Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such
participation.  (iii) If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such
Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per
annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.  (iv) Each Revolving Credit Lenders obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or to purchase and
fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar
to any of the foregoing; provided that each Revolving Credit Lenders obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. No such funding of risk
participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.  (d) Repayment of Participations. (i) At any time after any Revolving Credit Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any
payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such
Lenders risk participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender.  (ii) If any
payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any
settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date
of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender. 
(e) Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest
on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lenders Pro Rata Share of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such
Pro Rata Share shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender. 
  59 


(f) Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall make all payments of
principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender.  (g) Provisions Related to
Extended Revolving Credit Commitments. If the Maturity Date shall have occurred in respect of any tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments (the Expiring Credit Commitment) at a time when another tranche or tranches of
Revolving Credit Commitments is or are in effect with a longer Maturity Date (each a Non-Expiring Credit Commitment and collectively, the Non-Expiring Credit Commitments), then with respect to each
outstanding Swing Line Loan, if consented to by the Swing Line Lender, on the earliest occurring Maturity Date such Swing Line Loan shall be deemed reallocated to the tranche or tranches of the Non-Expiring Credit Commitments on a pro rata basis;
provided that (x) to the extent that the amount of such reallocation would cause the aggregate credit exposure to exceed the aggregate amount of such Non-Expiring Credit Commitments, immediately prior to such reallocation (after giving
effect to any repayments of Revolving Credit Loans and any reallocation of Letter of Credit participations as contemplated in Section 2.03(l)) the amount of Swing Line Loans to be reallocated equal to such excess shall be repaid and
(y) notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Specified Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower shall still be obligated to pay Swing Line Loans allocated to the Revolving Credit Lenders holding the Expiring Credit Commitments at the
Maturity Date of the Expiring Credit Commitment or if the Loans have been accelerated prior to the maturity date of the Expiring Credit Commitment. Commencing with the Maturity Date of any tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments, the sublimit for
Swing Line Loans shall be agreed solely with the Swing Line Lender.  Section 2.05. [Reserved]. 
Section 2.06. Prepayments.  (a) Optional. (i) Except as otherwise provided below in this Section 2.06(a), the Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily
prepay any Class or Classes of Term Loans and any Class or Classes of Revolving Credit Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (1) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:30
p.m. (A) two (2) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (B) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (2) any prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of
$1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof; and (3) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal
amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment, the Class(es) and Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid (such Class(es) and Type(s) of Loans to be selected by the Borrower) and in the case of a
prepayment of Term Loans, the manner in which the Borrower elects to have such prepayment applied to the remaining repayments thereof; provided that in the event such notice fails to specify the manner in which the respective prepayment of
Term Loans shall be applied to repayments thereof required pursuant to Section 2.08(a), such prepayment of Term Loans shall be applied in direct order of maturity to repayments thereof required pursuant to Section 2.08(a). The
Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make
such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any additional
amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each prepayment of the Loans pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) shall be paid to the Appropriate Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. Any prepayment of Term Loans made
on or prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date in connection with a Repricing Transaction shall be accompanied by the payment by the Borrower of the fee set forth in Section 2.10(b). 
(ii) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time,
voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (1) such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the
prepayment, and (2) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the
date and amount of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. 
  60 


(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Borrower may rescind any notice of prepayment under Section 2.06(a)(i) or 2.06(a)(ii) if such prepayment would have resulted from a refinancing of all or a portion of a Facility, which refinancing shall not be consummated or shall otherwise be
delayed.  (iv) Notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, any Company Party may prepay the outstanding Term Loans (which shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be automatically and permanently canceled immediately upon such prepayment) (or Holdings, the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries may purchase such outstanding Term Loans and immediately cancel them) on the following basis: 
(A) Any Company Party shall have the right to make a voluntary prepayment of Term Loans at a discount to par pursuant to
a Borrower Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment, Borrower Solicitation of Discount Range Prepayment Offers or Borrower Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers (any such prepayment, the Discounted Term Loan
Prepayment), in each case made in accordance with this Section 2.06(a)(iv).  (B)
(1) Any Company Party may from time to time offer to make a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment by providing the Auction Agent with five (5) Business Days notice in the form of a Specified Discount Prepayment Notice; provided that
(I) any such offer shall be made available, at the sole discretion of the Company Party, to (x) each Term Lender and/or (y) each Term Lender with respect to any Class of Term Loans on an individual tranche basis, (II) any such offer
shall specify the aggregate principal amount offered to be prepaid (the Specified Discount Prepayment Amount) with respect to each applicable tranche, the tranche or tranches of Term Loans subject to such offer and the
specific percentage discount to par (the Specified Discount) of such Term Loans to be prepaid (it being understood that different Specified Discounts and/or Specified Discount Prepayment Amounts may be offered with respect
to different tranches of Term Loans and, in such event, each such offer will be treated as a separate offer pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.06(a)(iv)(B)), (III) the Specified Discount Prepayment Amount shall be in an aggregate amount
not less than $5,000,000 and whole increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (IV) each such offer shall remain outstanding through the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date. The Auction Agent will promptly provide each Appropriate Lender
with a copy of such Specified Discount Prepayment Notice and a form of the Specified Discount Prepayment Response to be completed and returned by each such Term Lender to the Auction Agent (or its delegate) by no later than 5:00 p.m., on the third
Business Day after the date of delivery of such notice to such Lenders (which date may be extended for a period not exceeding three (3) Business Days upon notice by the Company Party to the Auction Agent) (the Specified Discount
Prepayment Response Date).  (2) Each Term Lender receiving such offer shall notify the Auction Agent (or its
delegate) by the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date whether or not it agrees to accept a prepayment of any of its applicable then outstanding Term Loans at the Specified Discount and, if so (such accepting Lender, a Discount
Prepayment Accepting Lender), the amount and the tranches of such Lenders Term Loans to be prepaid at such offered discount. Each acceptance of a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment by a Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender shall be
irrevocable. Any Term Lender whose Specified Discount Prepayment Response is not received by the Auction Agent by the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to have declined to accept the applicable Borrower Offer of Specified
Discount Prepayment.  (3) If there is at least one (1) Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender, the relevant Company Party
will make a prepayment of outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this paragraph (B) to each Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in accordance with the respective outstanding amount and tranches of Term
Loans specified in such Lenders Specified Discount Prepayment Response given pursuant to subsection (2) above; provided that, if the aggregate principal 
  61 



amount of Term Loans accepted for prepayment by all Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders exceeds the Specified Discount Prepayment Amount, such prepayment shall be made pro rata among the
Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts accepted to be prepaid by each such Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender and the Auction Agent (in consultation with such Company Party and subject to rounding
requirements of the Auction Agent made in its reasonable discretion) will calculate such proration (the Specified Discount Proration). The Auction Agent shall promptly, and in any case within three (3) Business Days
following the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date, notify (I) the relevant Company Party of the respective Term Lenders responses to such offer, the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date and the aggregate principal amount of the
Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the tranches to be prepaid, (II) each Term Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, and the aggregate principal amount and the tranches of Term Loans to be prepaid at the Specified Discount on such date
and (III) each Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender of the Specified Discount Proration, if any, and confirmation of the principal amount, tranche and Type of Term Loans of such Term Lender to be prepaid at the Specified Discount on such date. Each
determination by the Auction Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the Company Party and such Term Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The payment amount specified in such notice to the
Company Party shall be due and payable by such Company Party on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in accordance with subsection (F) below (subject to subsection (J) below). 
(C) (1) Any Company Party may from time to time solicit Discount Range Prepayment Offers by providing the Auction
Agent with five (5) Business Days notice in the form of a Discount Range Prepayment Notice; provided that (I) any such solicitation shall be extended, at the sole discretion of such Company Party, to (x) each Term Lender
and/or (y) each Term Lender with respect to any Class of Term Loans on an individual tranche basis, (II) any such notice shall specify the maximum aggregate principal amount of the relevant Term Loans (the Discount Range Prepayment
Amount), the tranche or tranches of Term Loans subject to such offer and the maximum and minimum percentage discounts to par (the Discount Range) of the principal amount of such Term Loans with respect to each
relevant tranche of Term Loans willing to be prepaid by such Company Party (it being understood that different Discount Ranges and/or Discount Range Prepayment Amounts may be offered with respect to different tranches of Term Loans and, in such
event, each such offer will be treated as a separate offer pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.06(a)(iv)(C)), (III) the Discount Range Prepayment Amount shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000 and whole increments of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof and (IV) each such solicitation by a Company Party shall remain outstanding through the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date. The Auction Agent will promptly provide each Appropriate Lender with a copy of such
Discount Range Prepayment Notice and a form of the Discount Range Prepayment Offer to be submitted by a responding Lender to the Auction Agent (or its delegate) by no later than 5:00 p.m., on the third Business Day after the date of delivery of such
notice to such Lenders (which date may be extended for a period not exceeding three (3) Business Days upon notice by the Company Party to the Auction Agent) (the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date). Each Term
Lenders Discount Range Prepayment Offer shall be irrevocable and shall specify a discount to par within the Discount Range (the Submitted Discount) at which such Term Lender is willing to allow prepayment of any or
all of its then outstanding Term Loans of the applicable tranche or tranches and the maximum aggregate principal amount and tranches of such Lenders Term Loans (the Submitted Amount) such Term Lender is willing to
have prepaid at the Submitted Discount. Any Term Lender whose Discount Range Prepayment Offer is not received by the Auction Agent by the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to have declined to accept a Discounted Term Loan
Prepayment of any of its Term Loans at any discount to their par value within the Discount Range. 
  62 


(2) The Auction Agent shall review all Discount Range Prepayment Offers received on or
before the applicable Discount Range Prepayment Response Date and shall determine (in consultation with such Company Party and subject to rounding requirements of the Auction Agent made in its sole reasonable discretion) the Applicable Discount and
Term Loans to be prepaid at such Applicable Discount in accordance with this subsection (C). The relevant Company Party agrees to accept on the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date all Discount Range Prepayment Offers received by the Auction
Agent within the Discount Range by the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date, in the order from the Submitted Discount that is the largest discount to par to the Submitted Discount that is the smallest discount to par, up to and including the
Submitted Discount that is the smallest discount to par within the Discount Range (such Submitted Discount that is the smallest discount to par within the Discount Range being referred to as the Applicable Discount) which
yields a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment in an aggregate principal amount equal to the lower of (I) the Discount Range Prepayment Amount and (II) the sum of all Submitted Amounts. Each Term Lender that has submitted a Discount Range Prepayment
Offer to accept prepayment at a discount to par that is larger than or equal to the Applicable Discount shall be deemed to have irrevocably consented to prepayment of Term Loans equal to its Submitted Amount (subject to any required proration
pursuant to the following subsection (3)) at the Applicable Discount (each such Term Lender, a Participating Lender).  (3) If there is at least one (1) Participating Lender, the relevant Company Party will prepay the respective outstanding Term Loans of each Participating Lender on the Discounted Prepayment Effective
Date in the aggregate principal amount and of the tranches specified in such Lenders Discount Range Prepayment Offer at the Applicable Discount; provided that if the Submitted Amount by all Participating Lenders offered at a discount to
par greater than the Applicable Discount exceeds the Discount Range Prepayment Amount, prepayment of the principal amount of the relevant Term Loans for those Participating Lenders whose Submitted Discount is a discount to par greater than or equal
to the Applicable Discount (the Identified Participating Lenders) shall be made pro rata among the Identified Participating Lenders in accordance with the Submitted Amount of each such Identified Participating Lender and
the Auction Agent (in consultation with such Company Party and subject to rounding requirements of the Auction Agent made in its sole reasonable discretion) will calculate such proration (the Discount Range Proration). The
Auction Agent shall promptly, and in any case within five (5) Business Days following the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date, notify (I) the relevant Company Party of the respective Term Lenders responses to such solicitation,
the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the Applicable Discount, and the aggregate principal amount of the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the tranches to be prepaid, (II) each Term Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the
Applicable Discount, and the aggregate principal amount and tranches of Term Loans to be prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such date, (III) each Participating Lender of the aggregate principal amount and tranches of such Term Lender to be
prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such date, and (IV) if applicable, each Identified Participating Lender of the Discount Range Proration. Each determination by the Auction Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the relevant
Company Party and Term Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The payment amount specified in such notice to the Company Party shall be due and payable by such Company Party on the Discounted Prepayment
Effective Date in accordance with subsection (F) below (subject to subsection (J) below).  (D)
(1) Any Company Party may from time to time solicit Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers by providing the Auction Agent with five (5) Business Days notice in the form of a Solicited Discounted Prepayment Notice; provided
that (I) any such solicitation shall be extended, at the sole discretion of such Company Party, to (x) each Term Lender and/or (y) each Term Lender with respect to any Class of Term Loans on an individual tranche basis, (II) any such
notice shall specify the maximum aggregate amount of the Term Loans (the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amount) and the tranche or tranches of Term Loans the applicable

  63 



Company Party is willing to prepay at a discount (it being understood that different Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amounts may be offered with respect to different tranches of Term Loans and,
in such event, each such offer will be treated as a separate offer pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.06(a)(iv)(D)), (III) the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amount shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000 and whole
increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (IV) each such solicitation by a Company Party shall remain outstanding through the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date. The Auction Agent will promptly provide each Appropriate Lender with a
copy of such Solicited Discounted Prepayment Notice and a form of the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer to be submitted by a responding Lender to the Auction Agent (or its delegate) by no later than 5:00 p.m., on the third Business Day after the
date of delivery of such notice to such Term Lenders (which date may be extended for a period not exceeding three (3) Business Days upon notice by the Company Party to the Auction Agent) (the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response
Date). Each Term Lenders Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer shall (x) be irrevocable, (y) remain outstanding until the Acceptance Date, and (z) specify both a discount to par (the Offered
Discount) at which such Term Lender is willing to allow prepayment of its then outstanding Term Loan and the maximum aggregate principal amount and tranches of such Term Loans (the Offered Amount) such Term
Lender is willing to have prepaid at the Offered Discount. Any Term Lender whose Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer is not received by the Auction Agent by the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to have declined
prepayment of any of its Term Loans at any discount.  (2) The Auction Agent shall promptly provide the relevant Company Party
with a copy of all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers received on or before the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date. Such Company Party shall review all such Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers and select the largest of the Offered
Discounts specified by the relevant responding Term Lenders in the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers that is acceptable to the Company Party in its sole discretion (the Acceptable Discount), if any. If the Company
Party elects, in its sole discretion, to accept any Offered Discount as the Acceptable Discount, then in no event later than by the third Business Day after the date of receipt by such Company Party from the Auction Agent of a copy of all Solicited
Discounted Prepayment Offers pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection (2) (the Acceptance Date), the Company Party shall submit an Acceptance and Prepayment Notice to the Auction Agent setting forth the
Acceptable Discount. If the Auction Agent shall fail to receive an Acceptance and Prepayment Notice from the Company Party by the Acceptance Date, such Company Party shall be deemed to have rejected all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers.
 (3) Based upon the Acceptable Discount and the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers received by Auction Agent by the
Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date, within three (3) Business Days after receipt of an Acceptance and Prepayment Notice (the Discounted Prepayment Determination Date), the Auction Agent will determine (in
consultation with such Company Party and subject to rounding requirements of the Auction Agent made in its sole reasonable discretion) the aggregate principal amount and the tranches of Term Loans (the Acceptable Prepayment
Amount) to be prepaid by the relevant Company Party at the Acceptable Discount in accordance with this Section 2.06(a)(iv)(D). If the Company Party elects to accept any Acceptable Discount, then the Company Party agrees to accept
all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers received by Auction Agent by the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date, in the order from largest Offered Discount to smallest Offered Discount, up to and including the Acceptable Discount. Each
Term Lender that has submitted a Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer with an Offered Discount that is greater than or equal to the Acceptable Discount shall be deemed to have irrevocably consented to prepayment of Term Loans equal to its Offered
Amount (subject to any required pro-rata reduction pursuant to the following sentence) at the Acceptable Discount (each such Lender, a Qualifying Lender). The Company Party will prepay outstanding Term Loans pursuant to
this subsection (D) to each Qualifying Lender in the aggregate 
  64 



principal amount and of the tranches specified in such Lenders Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer at the Acceptable Discount; provided that if the aggregate Offered Amount by all
Qualifying Lenders whose Offered Discount is greater than or equal to the Acceptable Discount exceeds the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amount, prepayment of the principal amount of the Term Loans for those Qualifying Lenders whose Offered
Discount is greater than or equal to the Acceptable Discount (the Identified Qualifying Lenders) shall be made pro rata among the Identified Qualifying Lenders in accordance with the Offered Amount of each such Identified
Qualifying Lender and the Auction Agent (in consultation with such Company Party and subject to rounding requirements of the Auction Agent made in its sole reasonable discretion) will calculate such proration (the Solicited Discount
Proration). On or prior to the Discounted Prepayment Determination Date, the Auction Agent shall promptly notify (I) the relevant Company Party of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date and Acceptable Prepayment Amount
comprising the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the tranches to be prepaid, (II) each Term Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the Acceptable Discount, and the Acceptable Prepayment Amount of all Term Loans and the tranches to be
prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such date, (III) each Qualifying Lender of the aggregate principal amount and the tranches of such Term Lender to be prepaid at the Acceptable Discount on such date, and (IV) if applicable, each Identified
Qualifying Lender of the Solicited Discount Proration. Each determination by the Auction Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to such Company Party and Term Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest
error. The payment amount specified in such notice to such Company Party shall be due and payable by such Company Party on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in accordance with subsection (F) below (subject to subsection (J) below).
 (E) In connection with any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment, the Company Parties and the Term Lenders
acknowledge and agree that the Auction Agent may require as a condition to any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment, the payment of customary and documented fees and out-of-pocket expenses from a Company Party in connection therewith. 
(F) If any Term Loan is prepaid in accordance with paragraphs (B) through (D) above, a Company Party shall
prepay such Term Loans on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, without premium or penalty. The relevant Company Party shall make such prepayment to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders,
Participating Lenders, or Qualifying Lenders, as applicable, at the Administrative Agents Office in immediately available funds not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date and all such prepayments shall be applied to
the remaining principal installments of the relevant tranche of Term Loans on a pro-rata basis across such installments. The Term Loans so prepaid shall be accompanied by all accrued and unpaid interest on the par principal amount so prepaid up to,
but not including, the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date. Each prepayment of the outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.06(a)(iv) shall be paid to the Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders, Participating Lenders, or Qualifying
Lenders, as applicable, and shall be applied to the relevant Term Loans of such Term Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share or other applicable share hereunder. The aggregate principal amount of the tranches and
installments of the relevant Term Loans outstanding shall be deemed reduced by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of the tranches of Term Loans prepaid on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in any Discounted Term Loan
Prepayment.  (G) To the extent not expressly provided for herein, each Discounted Term Loan Prepayment shall
be consummated pursuant to procedures consistent with the provisions in this Section 2.06(a)(iv), established by the Auction Agent acting in its reasonable discretion and as reasonably agreed by the applicable Company Party. 
  65 


(H) Notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, for
purposes of this Section 2.06(a)(iv), each notice or other communication required to be delivered or otherwise provided to the Auction Agent (or its delegate) shall be deemed to have been given upon the Auction Agents (or its
delegates) actual receipt during normal business hours of such notice or communication; provided that any notice or communication actually received outside of normal business hours shall be deemed to have been given as of the opening of
business on the next Business Day.  (I) Each of the Company Parties and the Term Lenders acknowledge and agree
that the Auction Agent may perform any and all of its duties under this Section 2.06(a)(iv) by itself or through any Affiliate of the Auction Agent and expressly consents to any such delegation of duties by the Auction Agent to such Affiliate
and the performance of such delegated duties by such Affiliate. The exculpatory provisions pursuant to this Agreement shall apply to each Affiliate of the Auction Agent and its respective activities in connection with any Discounted Term Loan
Prepayment provided for in this Section 2.06(a)(iv) as well as activities of the Auction Agent.  (J) Each
Company Party shall have the right, by written notice to the Auction Agent, to revoke or modify its offer to make a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and rescind the applicable Specified Discount Prepayment Notice, Discount Range Prepayment Notice or
Solicited Discounted Prepayment Notice therefor at its discretion at any time on or prior to the applicable Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date.  (K) Any failure by such Company Party to make any prepayment to a Lender, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 2.06(a)(iv) shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default under
Section 8.01 or otherwise.  (b) Mandatory. (i) Within five (5) Business Days after financial statements
have been delivered pursuant to Section 6.01(a) and the related Compliance Certificate has been delivered pursuant to Section 6.02(a), the Borrower shall cause to be prepaid Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to (A) 50%
of Excess Cash Flow, if any, for the fiscal year covered by such financial statements (commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2013) minus (B) the sum of (without duplication) (1) all voluntary prepayments of Term
Loans (excluding prepayments pursuant to Section 2.06(a)(iv)) during such fiscal year (excluding any voluntary prepayments of Term Loans made during such fiscal year that reduced the amount required to be prepaid pursuant to this
Section 2.06(b)(i) in the prior fiscal year) or after year-end and prior to when such Excess Cash Flow prepayment is due and (2) all voluntary prepayments of Revolving Credit Loans during such fiscal year (excluding any voluntary
prepayments of Revolving Credit Loans made during such fiscal year that reduced the amount required to be prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.06(b)(i) in the prior fiscal year) or after year-end and prior to when such Excess Cash Flow prepayment
is due to the extent the Revolving Credit Commitments are permanently reduced by the amount of such payments, but in the case of each of the immediately preceding clauses (1) and (2), to the extent such prepayments are funded with Internally
Generated Cash; provided that (x) the percentage of Excess Cash Flow specified in clause (A) above shall instead be 25% if the Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of the fiscal year covered by such
financial statements was less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.00 but greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and (y) no payment of any Term Loans shall be required under this Section 2.06(b)(i) if the Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio as of the last
day of the fiscal year covered by such financial statements was less than or equal to 3.25 to 1.00.  (ii) (A) If
(x) the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary Disposes of any property or assets (other than any Disposition of any property or assets permitted by Section 7.05(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (m), (o), (p), (q) or
(r)) or (y) any Casualty Event occurs, which in the aggregate results in the realization or receipt by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary of Net Cash Proceeds, the Borrower shall cause to be prepaid on or prior to the date which is ten
(10) Business Days after the date of the realization or receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received; provided that, if at the time that any such
prepayment would be required, the Borrower is required to offer to repurchase or prepay Permitted Pari Passu Secured Refinancing Debt or Incremental Equivalent Debt or other Indebtedness permitted by Section 7.03 that is secured on a pari
passu basis with the Obligations (or, in each case, any Indebtedness pursuant to a Permitted Refinancing in respect thereof that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Obligations) pursuant to the terms of the documentation governing
such Indebtedness with such Net Cash Proceeds (such Permitted Pari Passu Secured Refinancing Debt or Incremental Equivalent Debt or other Indebtedness 
  66 



permitted by Section 7.03 that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Obligations (or, in each case, any Indebtedness pursuant to a Permitted Refinancing in respect thereof)
required to be offered to be so repurchased or prepaid, Other Applicable Indebtedness), then the Borrower may apply such Net Cash Proceeds on a pro rata basis (determined on the basis of the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the Term Loans and Other Applicable Indebtedness at such time; provided, further that the portion of such net proceeds allocated to the Other Applicable Indebtedness shall not exceed the amount of such net proceeds required
to be allocated to the Other Applicable Indebtedness pursuant to the terms thereof, and the remaining amount, if any, of such net proceeds shall be allocated to the Term Loans in accordance with the terms hereof) to the prepayment of the Term Loans
and to the repurchase or prepayment of Other Applicable Indebtedness, and the amount of prepayment of the Term Loans that would have otherwise been required pursuant to this Section 2.06(b)(ii)(A) shall be reduced accordingly; provided,
further, that to the extent the holders of Other Applicable Indebtedness decline to have such Indebtedness repurchased or prepaid, the declined amount shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date of such
rejection) be applied to prepay the Term Loans in accordance with the terms hereof; provided, further that no such prepayment shall be required pursuant to this Section 2.06(b)(ii) with respect to such portion of such Net Cash
Proceeds that the Borrower shall have, on or prior to such date, given written notice to the Administrative Agent of its intent to reinvest in accordance with Section 2.06(b)(ii)(B); 
(B) With respect to any Net Cash Proceeds realized or received with respect to any Disposition (other than any
Disposition specifically excluded from the application of Section 2.06(b)(ii)(A) and subject to the limitation set forth in Section 7.05(k) with respect to the reinvestment of Net Cash Proceeds from Dispositions thereunder) or any Casualty
Event, at the option of the Borrower, the Borrower may reinvest all or any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds in assets useful for its business or the business of any of the Restricted Subsidiaries within (x) twelve (12) months following
receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds or (y) if the Borrower or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary enters into a legally binding commitment to reinvest such Net Cash Proceeds within twelve (12) months following receipt thereof, within the
later of (a) one hundred and eighty (180) days following the date of such legally binding commitment and (b) twelve (12) months following receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds; provided that if any Net Cash Proceeds are no
longer intended to be or cannot be so reinvested (whether because the applicable reinvestment period has expired or otherwise) at any time after delivery of a notice of reinvestment election, an amount equal to any such Net Cash Proceeds shall be
applied within five (5) Business Days after the Borrower reasonably determines that such Net Cash Proceeds are no longer intended to be or cannot be so reinvested to the prepayment of the Term Loans as set forth in this Section 2.06.
 (iii) If the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs or issues any Indebtedness (A) not expressly permitted
to be incurred or issued pursuant to any clause of Section 7.03 or (B) that constitute Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness, the Borrower shall cause to be prepaid Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to 100% of all Net
Cash Proceeds received therefrom on or prior to the date which is five (5) Business Days after the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds.  (iv) [Reserved].  (v) [Reserved]. 
(vi) If for any reason the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposures at any time exceeds the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments
then in effect, the Borrower shall promptly prepay or cause to be promptly prepaid Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Line Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided that the
Borrower shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.06(b)(vi) unless after the prepayment in full of the Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Line Loans, such aggregate Outstanding Amount exceeds the
aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect.  (vii) [Reserved]. 
(viii) Except with respect to Loans incurred in connection with any Refinancing Amendment, Term Loan Extension Request or any
Incremental Amendment, (A) each prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.06(b) shall be applied ratably to each Class of Term Loans then outstanding (provided that (i) any

  67 



prepayment of Term Loans with the Net Cash Proceeds of, or in exchange for, Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness shall be applied solely to each applicable Class of Refinanced Debt selected
by the Borrower, and (ii) any Class of Extended Term Loans, Other Term Loans and Incremental Term Loans may specify that one or more other Classes of Term Loans may be prepaid prior to such Class of Extended Term Loans, Other Term Loans or
Incremental Term Loans), (B) with respect to each Class of Term Loans, each prepayment pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 2.06(b) shall be applied in direct order of maturity to repayments thereof required
pursuant to Section 2.08(a), and (C) each prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.06(b) shall be paid to the Appropriate Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, subject to clause (ix) of
this Section 2.06(b) in respect of Term Loans. Any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan pursuant to this Section 2.06(b) shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon. Any prepayment of Term Loans made on or prior to the one
(1) year anniversary of the Closing Date pursuant to Section 2.06(b)(iii) as part of a Repricing Transaction shall be accompanied by the fee set forth in Section 2.10(b). 
(ix) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans required to be made
pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 2.06(b) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of any such prepayment. Each such notice shall specify the date of such prepayment and provide a reasonably detailed
calculation of the amount of such prepayment. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the contents of the Borrowers prepayment notice and of such Appropriate Lenders Pro Rata Share of the
prepayment. Each Appropriate Lender may reject all or a portion of its Pro Rata Share of any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans required to be made pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 2.06(b) by providing
written notice (each, a Rejection Notice) to the Administrative Agent no later than 5:00 p.m. one Business Day after the date of such Lenders receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent regarding such prepayment;
provided that no Lender may reject any prepayment made under Section 2.06(b)(iii)(B). Each Rejection Notice from a given Lender shall specify the principal amount of the mandatory repayment of Term Loans to be rejected by such Lender
(such amounts so rejected, Rejected Amounts). If a Lender fails to deliver a Rejection Notice to the Administrative Agent within the time frame specified above or such Rejection Notice fails to specify the principal amount
of the Term Loans to be rejected, any such failure will be deemed an acceptance of the total amount of such mandatory repayment of Term Loans. In the event a Lender rejects all or any portion of its Pro Rata Share of any mandatory prepayment
of Term Loans required pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 2.06(b), the rejected portion of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such prepayment shall be retained by the Borrower (such Rejected Amounts, the
Borrower Retained Prepayment Amounts).  (x) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Section 2.06, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Cash Proceeds of any Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary (Foreign Disposition), the Net Cash Proceeds of any Casualty Event from a Foreign Subsidiary (a
Foreign Casualty Event) or Excess Cash Flow attributable to Foreign Subsidiaries are prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess
Cash Flow so affected will not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans at the times provided in this Section 2.06(b) but may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law will not
permit repatriation to the United States (the Borrower hereby agreeing to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law to permit such
repatriation), and once such repatriation of any of such affected Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow is permitted under the applicable local law, such repatriation will be promptly effected and an amount equal to such repatriated Net Cash
Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow will be promptly (and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days after such repatriation) applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) to the repayment of the Term Loans
pursuant to this Section 2.06(b) to the extent provided herein and (ii) to the extent that the Borrower has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Cash Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition or any Foreign
Casualty Event or Excess Cash Flow attributable to Foreign Subsidiaries would have material adverse tax consequences with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow, such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected will not be
required to be applied to repay Term Loans at the times provided in this Section 2.06(b) but may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary until such time as it may repatriate such amount without incurring such material adverse tax
consequences (at which time such amount shall be repatriated to the Borrower and applied to repay the Term Loans). 
  68 


(c) Funding Losses, Etc. All prepayments under this Section 2.06 shall be made
together with, in the case of any such prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a date prior to the last day of an Interest Period therefor, any amounts owing in respect of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan pursuant to Section 3.05. Notwithstanding
any of the other provisions of Section 2.06(b), so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, if any prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans is required to be made under Section 2.06(b) (but excluding prepayments
required under clause (vi) of Section 2.06(b)), prior to the last day of the Interest Period therefor, in lieu of making any payment pursuant to Section 2.06(b) in respect of any such Eurocurrency Rate Loan prior to the last day of
the Interest Period therefor, the Borrower may, in its sole discretion, deposit the amount of any such prepayment otherwise required to be made thereunder into a Cash Collateral Account until the last day of such Interest Period, at which time the
Administrative Agent shall be authorized (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrower or any other Loan Party) to apply such amount to the prepayment of such Loans in accordance with Section 2.06(b). Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall also be authorized (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrower or any other Loan Party) to apply such amount to the prepayment of the outstanding
Loans in accordance with Section 2.06(b) and the Borrower shall be responsible for any amounts owing in respect of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan pursuant to Section 3.05. 
Section 2.07. Termination or Reduction of Commitments. 
(a) Optional. The Borrower may, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the unused Commitments of any
Class, or from time to time permanently reduce the unused Commitments of any Class; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of termination or
reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $500,000 or any whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof and (iii) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments, the Letter
of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility, such sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. The amount of any such Revolving Credit Commitment reduction shall not be
applied to the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit unless otherwise specified by the Borrower or as otherwise provided in the immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may rescind or postpone any
notice of termination of the Commitments if such termination would have resulted from a refinancing of all of the applicable Facility, which refinancing shall not be consummated or otherwise shall be delayed. 
(b) Mandatory. The Term Commitment of each Term Lender shall be automatically and permanently reduced to $0 upon the making of
such Term Lenders Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.01(a). The Revolving Credit Commitment of each Revolving Credit Lender shall automatically and permanently terminate on the Maturity Date for the Revolving Credit Facility;
provided that (x) the foregoing shall not release any Revolving Credit Lender from any liability it may have for its failure to fund Revolving Credit Loans, L/C Advances or participations in Swing Line Loans that were required to be
funded by it on or prior to such Maturity Date and (y) the foregoing will not release any Revolving Credit Lender from any obligation to fund its portion of L/C Advances or participations in Swing Line Loans with respect to Letters of Credit
issued or Swing Line Loans made prior to such Maturity Date.  (c) Application of Commitment Reductions; Payment of
Fees. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any termination or reduction of unused portions of the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Swing Line Sublimit or the unused Commitments of any Class under this Section 2.07.
Upon any reduction of unused Commitments of any Class, the Commitment of each Lender of such Class shall be reduced by such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the amount by which such Commitments are reduced (other than the termination of the
Commitment of any Lender as provided in Section 3.07). All commitment fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.

Closing Date (which payments shall be reduced as a result of the application of prepayments in accordance with the order of priority set forth in Section 2.06 and Section 10.07(n)) and (B) on the Maturity Date for the Term Loans, the
aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans outstanding on such date.  (ii) The amount of any such payment set forth in

(5) Business Days after such Swing Line Loan is made and (ii) the Maturity Date for the Revolving Credit Facility. 
Section 2.09. Interest.  (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.09(b), (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per
annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable Borrowing date at a rate per annum equal
to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable Borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
Applicable Rate for Revolving Credit Loans.  (b) The Borrower shall pay interest on past due amounts hereunder at a
fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws; provided that no interest at the Default Rate shall accrue or be payable to a Defaulting Lender so long as such
Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.  (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and
payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.  (d) All computations of interest hereunder shall be made in accordance with Section 2.11.  Section 2.10. Fees.  In addition to certain fees described in
Sections 2.03(h) and (i):  (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a commitment fee equal to the Applicable Rate with respect to commitment fees times the actual daily amount by which the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitment
exceeds the sum of (A) Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any Swing Line Loans) and (B) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations; provided that any commitment fee accrued with
respect to any of the Revolving Credit Commitments of a Defaulting Lender during the period prior to the time such Lender became a Defaulting Lender and unpaid at such time shall not be payable by the Borrower so long as such Lender shall be a
Defaulting Lender except to the extent that such commitment fee 
  70 



shall otherwise have been due and payable by the Borrower prior to such time; and provided, further, that no commitment fee shall accrue on any of the Revolving Credit Commitments
of a Defaulting Lender so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times from the Closing Date until the Maturity Date for the Revolving Credit Facility, including at any time during which one or more
of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the
Maturity Date for the Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the
Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.  (b) At the time of
the effectiveness of any Repricing Transaction that is consummated on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each Term Lender with Term Loans that are
either prepaid, refinanced, substituted, replaced or otherwise subjected to a pricing reduction in connection with such Repricing Transaction (including each Term Lender that withholds its consent to such Repricing Transaction and is replaced as a
Lender, or whose outstanding Term Loans are repaid in full, under Section 3.07(a)), a fee in an amount equal to 1.0% of (x) in the case of a Repricing Transaction described in clause (i) of the definition thereof, the aggregate
principal amount of all Term Loans prepaid, refinanced, substituted or replaced in connection with such Repricing Transaction and (y) in the case of a Repricing Transaction described in clause (ii) of the definition thereof, the aggregate
principal amount of all Term Loans outstanding on such date that are subject to an effective pricing reduction pursuant to such Repricing Transaction. Such fees shall be earned, due and payable upon the date of the effectiveness of such Repricing
Transaction.  (c) The Borrower agrees to pay on the Closing Date to each Lender party to this Agreement as a Lender on the
Closing Date a closing fee in an amount equal to 1.0% of the stated principal amount (as applicable) of such Lenders Term Loan and funded and unfunded Revolving Credit Commitments (which shall include the face amount of any issued but undrawn
Letters of Credit), payable to such Lender from the proceeds of the Facilities as and when funded on the Closing Date. Such closing fees shall be in all respects fully earned, due and payable on the Closing Date and non-refundable and non-creditable
for any reason whatsoever thereafter.  (d) Other Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Agents such fees as shall have
been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever (except as expressly agreed between the Borrower and the applicable
Agent).  Section 2.11. Computation of Interest and Fees. 
All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by the Administrative Agents prime
rate shall be made on the basis of a year of three hundred and sixty-five (365) days (or three hundred and sixty six (366) days, as the case may be) and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made
on the basis of a three hundred and sixty (360) day year and actual days elapsed. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or
such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.13(a), bear interest for one (1) day. In computing interest on any Loan, the first day of an Interest Period
applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted from a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan to such Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be included, and the expiration date
of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Base Rate Loan to such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be excluded. Each
determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  Section 2.12. Evidence of Indebtedness. 
  71 


(a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more
accounts or records maintained by such Lender and evidenced by one or more entries in the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent, acting solely for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c), as agent for the Borrower, in each
case in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be prima facie evidence absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the
Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the
event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of
manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note payable to such Lender, which shall evidence such Lenders
Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
(b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.12(a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain
in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records and, in the case of the Administrative Agent, entries in the Register in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.07(d), evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of
participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent in the Register and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the
Register shall control in the absence of manifest error.  (c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the
Register, and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Sections 2.12(a) and (b), shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the
case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error; provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to
make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
Section 2.13. Payments Generally.  (a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agents Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later
than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such
Lenders Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. 
(b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next
following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be; provided that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Loans to be made in
the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  (c) Unless the
Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto.
If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds, then: 
  72 


(i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith
on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made
available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and 
(ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the
amount thereof in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the
Compensation Period) at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon), then
such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount
forthwith upon the Administrative Agents demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the
Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the
Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.  A
notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.13(c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  (d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available
to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like
funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.  (e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make
Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of
its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation.  (f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will
obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.  (g) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative
Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such
payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in Section 8.04. If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations
of the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, elect to
distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the sum of (a) the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time and (b) the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations
outstanding at such time, in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender.  Section 2.14. Sharing of Payments. 
  73 


If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of
the Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans held by it, any payment of principal or interest (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable
share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them and/or such
subparticipations in the participations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans or such participations, as
the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to
any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to
such paying Lenders ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lenders required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid
or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by the
Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement as in effect from time to time (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (B) any payment obtained by a Lender as
consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant permitted hereunder. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.14 and will in each case notify the Lenders following
any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this
Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.  Section 2.15. Extension of Term Loans; Extension of Revolving Credit Loans.  (a) Extension of Term Loans. The Borrower may at any time and from time to time request that all or a portion of the Term Loans of a given Class (each, an Existing Term Loan
Tranche) be amended to extend the scheduled Maturity Date(s) with respect to all or a portion of any principal amount of such Term Loans (any such Term Loans which have been so amended, Extended Term Loans)
and to provide for other terms consistent with this Section 2.15. In order to establish any Extended Term Loans, the Borrower shall provide a notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall provide a copy of such notice to each of the Lenders
under the applicable Existing Term Loan Tranche) (each, a Term Loan Extension Request) setting forth the proposed terms of the Extended Term Loans to be established, which shall (x) be identical as offered to each
Lender under such Existing Term Loan Tranche (including as to the proposed interest rates and fees payable, but excluding any arrangement, structuring or other fees payable in connection therewith that are not generally shared with all relevant
Lenders) and offered pro rata to each Lender under such Existing Term Loan Tranche and (y) be identical to the Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Tranche from which such Extended Term Loans are intended to be amended, except that:
(i) all or any of the scheduled amortization payments of principal of the Extended Term Loans may be delayed to later dates than the scheduled amortization payments of principal of the Term Loans of such Existing Term Loan Tranche, to the
extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment; (ii) the All-In Yield with respect to the Extended Term Loans (whether in the form of interest rate margin, upfront fees, original issue discount or otherwise) may be different from the
All-In Yield for the Term Loans of such Existing Term Loan Tranche, in each case, to the extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment; (iii) the Extension Amendment may provide for other covenants and terms that apply solely to any
period after the Latest Maturity Date that is in effect on the effective date of the Extension Amendment (immediately prior to the establishment of such Extended Term Loans); and (iv) Extended Term Loans may have call protection as may be
agreed by the Borrower and the Lenders thereof; provided, however, that (A) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time a Term Loan Extension Request is delivered to Lenders, (B) in no event shall
the Maturity Date of any Extended Term Loans of a given Term Loan Extension Series at the time of establishment thereof be 
  74 



earlier than the then Latest Maturity Date of any other Term Loans hereunder, (C) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Extended Term Loans of a given Term Loan Extension Series at
the time of establishment thereof shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Existing Term Loan Tranche (as originally in effect prior to any amortization or prepayments thereto), (D) all documentation in
respect of such Extension Amendment shall be consistent with the foregoing and (E) any Extended Term Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or less than or greater than a pro rata basis in any voluntary repayments or prepayments of principal
of Term Loans hereunder and on a pro rata basis or less than a pro rata basis (but not greater than a pro rata basis except in the case of a prepayment under Section 2.06(b)(iii)(B)) in any mandatory repayments or prepayments of principal of
Term Loans hereunder, in each case as specified in the respective Term Loan Extension Request. Any Extended Term Loans amended pursuant to any Term Loan Extension Request shall be designated a series (each, a Term Loan Extension
Series) of Extended Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that any Extended Term Loans amended from an Existing Term Loan Tranche may, to the extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment, be designated
as an increase in any previously established Term Loan Extension Series with respect to such Existing Term Loan Tranche (in which case scheduled amortization with respect thereto shall be proportionately increased). Each request for a Term Loan
Extension Series of Extended Term Loans proposed to be incurred under this Section 2.15 shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $10,000,000 (it being understood that the actual principal amount thereof provided by the
applicable Lenders may be lower than such minimum amount) and the Borrower may impose an Extension Minimum Condition with respect to any Term Loan Extension Request, which may be waived by the Borrower in its sole discretion. 
(b) Extension of Revolving Credit Commitments. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time request that all or a portion
of the Revolving Credit Commitments (and related Revolving Credit Loans and other related extensions of Credit) of a given Class (each, an Existing Revolver Tranche) be amended to extend the scheduled Maturity Date(s) with
respect to all or a portion of such Revolving Credit Commitments (any such Revolving Credit Commitments which have been so amended, Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and the revolving loans thereunder,
Extended Revolving Credit Loans) and to provide for other terms consistent with this Section 2.15. In order to establish any Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, the Borrower shall provide a notice to the
Administrative Agent (who shall provide a copy of such notice to each of the Lenders under the applicable Existing Revolver Tranche) (each, a Revolver Extension Request) setting forth the proposed terms of the Extended
Revolving Credit Commitments to be established, which shall (x) be identical as offered to each Lender under such Existing Revolver Tranche (including as to the proposed interest rates and fees payable, but excluding any arrangement,
structuring or other fees payable in connection therewith that are not generally shared with all relevant Lenders) and offered pro rata to each Lender under such Existing Revolver Tranche and (y) be identical to the Revolving Credit Commitments
under the Existing Revolver Tranche from which such Extended Revolving Credit Commitments are to be amended, except that: (i) the Maturity Date of the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments may be delayed to a later date than the Maturity Date
of the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Existing Revolver Tranche, to the extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment; provided, however, that at no time shall there be Classes of Revolving Credit Commitments hereunder
(including Other Revolving Credit Commitments, Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments and Extended Revolving Credit Commitments) which have more than three (3) different Maturity Dates (unless otherwise consented to by the Administrative
Agent); (ii) the All-In Yield with respect to extensions of credit under the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments (whether in the form of interest rate margin, upfront fees or otherwise) may be different than the All-In Yield for extensions of
credit under the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Existing Revolver Tranche, in each case, to the extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment; (iii) the Extension Amendment may provide for other covenants and terms that apply
solely to any period after the Latest Maturity Date that is in effect on the effective date of the Extension Amendment (immediately prior to the establishment of such Extended Revolving Credit Commitments); and (iv) all borrowings under the
applicable Revolving Credit Commitments (i.e., the Existing Revolver Tranche and the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments of the applicable Revolver Extension Series) and repayments thereunder shall be made on a pro rata basis (except for
(I) payments of interest and fees at different rates on Extended Revolving Credit Commitments (and related outstandings) and (II) repayments required upon the Maturity Date of the non-extending Revolving Credit Commitments) and all Swing Line
Loans and Letters of Credit shall be participated on a pro rata basis by all Lenders with Revolving Credit Commitments (subject to the provisions of Sections 2.03(l) and 2.04(g)); provided, further, that (A) no Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing at the time a Revolver Extension Request is delivered to Lenders, (B) in no event shall the Maturity Date of any Extended Revolving Credit Commitments of a given Revolver Extension Series at the time of
establishment thereof be earlier than the then Latest Maturity Date of any other Revolving Credit Commitments 
  75 



hereunder and (C) all documentation in respect of such Extension Amendment shall be consistent with the foregoing. Any Extended Revolving Credit Commitments amended pursuant to any Revolver
Extension Request shall be designated a series (each, a Revolver Extension Series) of Extended Revolving Credit Commitments for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that any Extended Revolving Credit Commitments
amended from an Existing Revolver Tranche may, to the extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment, be designated as an increase in any previously established Revolver Extension Series with respect to such Existing Revolver Tranche. Each
request for a Revolver Extension Series of Extended Revolving Credit Commitments proposed to be incurred under this Section 2.15 shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $10,000,000 (it being understood that the actual
principal amount thereof provided by the applicable Lenders may be lower than such minimum amount) and the Borrower may impose an Extension Minimum Condition with respect to any Revolver Extension Request, which may be waived by the Borrower in its
sole discretion.  (c) Extension Request. The Borrower shall provide the applicable Extension Request at least five
(5) Business Days (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior to the date on which Lenders under the Existing Term Loan Tranche or Existing Revolver Tranche, as applicable, are requested to respond, and shall
agree to such procedures, if any, as may be established by, or acceptable to, the Administrative Agent, in each case acting reasonably to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.15. No Lender shall have any obligation to agree to have any of
its Term Loans of any Existing Term Loan Tranche amended into Extended Term Loans or any of its Revolving Credit Commitments amended into Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, pursuant to any Extension Request. Any Lender holding a
Loan under an Existing Term Loan Tranche wishing to have all or a portion of its Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Tranche subject to such Extension Request amended into Extended Term Loans (each, an Extending Term
Lender) and any Revolving Credit Lender wishing to have all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitments under the Existing Revolver Tranche subject to such Extension Request amended into Extended Revolving Credit Commitments
(each, an Extending Revolving Credit Lender), as applicable, shall notify the Administrative Agent (each, an Extension Election) on or prior to the date specified in such Extension Request of the
amount of its Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Tranche or Revolving Credit Commitments under the Existing Revolver Tranche, as applicable, which it has elected to request be amended into Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Credit
Commitments, as applicable (subject to any minimum denomination requirements imposed by the Administrative Agent). In the event that the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Tranche or Revolving Credit Commitments
under the Existing Revolver Tranche, as applicable, in respect of which applicable Term Lenders or Revolving Credit Lenders, as the case may be, shall have accepted the relevant Extension Request exceeds the amount of Extended Term Loans or Extended
Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, requested to be extended pursuant to the Extension Request, Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, subject to Extension Elections shall be amended to Extended Term Loans or Revolving
Credit Commitments, as applicable, on a pro rata basis (subject to rounding by the Administrative Agent, which shall be conclusive) based on the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, included in
each such Extension Election.  (d) Extension Amendment. Extended Term Loans and Extended Revolving Credit Commitments
shall be established pursuant to one or more amendments (each, an Extension Amendment) to this Agreement among the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent and each Extending Term Lender or Extending
Revolving Credit Lender, as applicable, providing an Extended Term Loan or Extended Revolving Credit Commitment, as applicable, thereunder, which shall be consistent with the provisions set forth in Sections 2.15(a) or (b) above, respectively
(but which shall not require the consent of any other Lender). The Commitments to provide Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, shall become effective on the date specified in the applicable Extension
Amendment, subject to the satisfaction of each of: (i) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02, (ii) the Extension Minimum Condition (unless waived by the Borrower) and (iii) to the extent reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent, receipt by the Administrative Agent of (i) legal opinions, board resolutions and officers certificates consistent with those delivered on the Closing Date (conformed as appropriate) other than changes to such legal
opinions resulting from a change in law, change in fact or change to counsels form of opinion reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and (ii) reaffirmation agreements and/or such amendments to the Collateral Documents as may
be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent in order to ensure that the Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, are provided with the benefit of the applicable Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Extension Amendment. Each of the parties hereto hereby (A) agrees that this 
  76 



Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended pursuant to an Extension Amendment, without the consent of any other Lenders, to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to
(i) reflect the existence and terms of the Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, incurred pursuant thereto, (ii) modify the scheduled repayments set forth in Section 2.08 with respect to any
Existing Term Loan Tranche subject to an Extension Election to reflect a reduction in the principal amount of the Term Loans thereunder in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Extended Term Loans amended pursuant to the
applicable Extension (with such amount to be applied ratably to reduce scheduled repayments of such Term Loans required pursuant to Section 2.08), (iii) modify the prepayments set forth in Section 2.06 to reflect the existence of the
Extended Term Loans and the application of prepayments with respect thereto and (iv) effect such other amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.15, and the Required Lenders hereby expressly and irrevocably, for the benefit of all parties hereto, authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any such Extension
Amendment and (B) consent to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.15 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment of interest, fees or premiums in respect of any Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Credit Commitments on
such terms as may be set forth in the relevant Extension Amendment.  (e) No Prepayment. No conversion or extension of
Loans or Commitments pursuant to any Extension Amendment in accordance with this Section 2.15 shall constitute a voluntary or mandatory payment or prepayment for purposes of this Agreement. 
(f) This Section 2.15 shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.14 or 10.01 to the contrary. 
Section 2.16. Incremental Borrowings.  (a) Incremental Commitments. The Borrower may at any time or from time to time after the Closing Date, by notice to the Administrative Agent (an Incremental Loan Request),
request (A) one or more new commitments which may be of the same Class as any outstanding Term Loans (a Term Loan Increase) or a new Class of term loans (collectively with any Term Loan Increase, the
Incremental Term Commitments) and/or (B) one or more increases in the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments (a Revolving Commitment Increase) or the establishment of one or more new
revolving credit commitments (any such new commitments, collectively with any Revolving Commitment Increases, the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments and the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, collectively with
any Incremental Term Commitments, the Incremental Commitments), whereupon the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders. 
(b) Incremental Loans. Any Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments (other than Term Loan Increases and
Revolving Commitment Increases) made on an Incremental Facility Closing Date shall be designated a separate Class of Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement. On any
Incremental Facility Closing Date on which any Incremental Term Commitments of any Class are effected (including through any Term Loan Increase), subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions in this Section 2.16, (i) each
Incremental Term Lender of such Class shall make a Loan to the Borrower (an Incremental Term Loan) in an amount equal to its Incremental Term Commitment of such Class and (ii) each Incremental Term Lender of such Class
shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to the Incremental Term Commitment of such Class and the Incremental Term Loans of such Class made pursuant thereto. On any Incremental Facility Closing Date on which any Incremental Revolving Credit
Commitments of any Class are effected (including through any Revolving Commitment Increase), subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions in this Section 2.16, (i) each Incremental Revolving Credit Lender of such Class shall
make its Commitment available to the Borrower (when borrowed, an Incremental Revolving Loan and collectively with any Incremental Term Loan, an Incremental Loan) in an amount equal to its
Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class and (ii) each Incremental Revolving Credit Lender of such Class shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class and the Incremental
Revolving Loans of such Class made pursuant thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Incremental Term Loans may have identical terms to any of the Term Loans and be treated as the same Class as any of such Term Loans. 
  77 


(c) Incremental Loan Request. Each Incremental Loan Request from the Borrower
pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms of the relevant Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments. Incremental Term Loans may be made, and Incremental Revolving Credit
Commitments may be provided, by any existing Lender (but no existing Lender will have an obligation to make any Incremental Commitment, nor will the Borrower have any obligation to approach any existing Lenders to provide any Incremental Commitment)
or by any other bank or other financial institution or other institutional lenders (any such other bank, other financial institution or other institutional lenders being called an Additional Lender) (each such existing
Lender or Additional Lender providing such Commitment or Loan, an Incremental Revolving Credit Lender or Incremental Term Lender, as applicable, and, collectively, the Incremental
Lenders); provided that (i) the Administrative Agent, each Swing Line Lender and each L/C Issuer shall have consented (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such Additional Lenders making such Incremental
Term Loans or providing such Revolving Commitment Increases to the extent such consent, if any, would be required under Section 10.07(b) for an assignment of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, to such Additional Lender,
(ii) with respect to Incremental Term Commitments, any Affiliated Lender providing an Incremental Term Commitment shall be subject to the same restrictions set forth in Section 10.07(k) as they would otherwise be subject to with respect to
any purchase by or assignment to such Affiliated Lender of Term Loans and (iii) Affiliated Lenders may not provide Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments.  (d) Effectiveness of Incremental Amendment. The effectiveness of any Incremental Amendment, and the Incremental Commitments thereunder, shall be subject to the satisfaction on the date thereof (the
Incremental Facility Closing Date) of each of the following conditions:  (i) no Event
of Default shall exist after giving effect to such Incremental Commitments; provided that, with respect to any Incremental Amendment the primary purpose of which is to finance a Permitted Acquisition or any other Investment permitted by this
Agreement constituting an acquisition of assets constituting a business unit, line of business or division of, or all or substantially all of the Equity Interests of, another Person, this clause (i) may be waived or omitted by Incremental
Lenders holding more than 50% of the aggregate Incremental Commitments under such Incremental Amendment;  (ii)
the representations and warranties of each Loan Party set forth in Article V and in each other Loan Document shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Incremental Facility Closing Date with the same effect as though made on
and as of such date, except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date; provided that any representation
and warranty that is qualified as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar language shall be true and correct (after giving effect to any qualification therein) in all respects on such respective dates; provided
further that, with respect to any Incremental Amendment the primary purpose of which is to finance a Permitted Acquisition or any other Investment permitted by this Agreement constituting an acquisition of assets constituting a business unit,
line of business or division of, or all or substantially all of the Equity Interests of, another Person, this clause (ii) (other than with respect to the Specified Representations) may be waived or omitted (or the scope or content of any
representation and warranty modified) by Incremental Lenders holding more than 50% of the aggregate Incremental Commitments under such Incremental Amendment;  (iii) each Incremental Term Commitment shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $25,000,000 and shall be in an increment of $1,000,000 (provided that such amount may be less
than $25,000,000 if such amount represents all remaining availability under the limit set forth in the next sentence) and each Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $10,000,000 and
shall be in an increment of $1,000,000 (provided that such amount may be less than $10,000,000 if such amount represents all remaining availability under the limit set forth in the next sentence); 
(iv) the aggregate principal amount of the Incremental Term Loans and the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments shall
not exceed (A) $150,000,000 in the aggregate pursuant to this clause (A) or (B) at the Borrowers option, up to an amount of Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments so long as the Consolidated First
Lien Net Leverage Ratio is no more than 4.25 to 1.00 for the Test Period most recently ended, after giving effect to any such incurrence on a Pro Forma 
  78 



Basis, and, in each case, with respect to any Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment, assuming a borrowing of the maximum amount of Loans available thereunder (or if the Incremental Facility
will rank junior in right of security with the Revolving Credit Loans and the Term Loans, up to an amount of Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments so long as the Total Net Leverage Ratio is no more than 5.50 to 1.00 for
the Test Period most recently ended, after giving effect to any such incurrence on a Pro Forma Basis, and, in each case, with respect to any Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment, assuming a borrowing of the maximum amount of Loans available
thereunder) (such amounts under this clause (A) and (B), the Available Incremental Amount); and  (v) (A) to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, the receipt by the Administrative Agent of (i) legal opinions, board resolutions and officers certificates consistent
with those delivered on the Closing Date (conformed as appropriate) (other than changes to such legal opinions resulting from a change in law, change in fact or change to counsels form of opinion reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent) and (ii) reaffirmation agreements and/or such amendments to the Collateral Documents as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent in order to ensure that the Incremental Loans or Incremental Commitments, as applicable, are
provided with the benefit of the applicable Loan Documents, and (B) to the extent provided in the applicable Incremental Amendment, such other conditions as the Borrower and the Lenders providing such Incremental Commitments may agree.
 (e) Required Terms. The terms, provisions and documentation of the Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Term
Commitments or the Incremental Revolving Loans and Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, as the case may be, of any Class shall be as agreed between the Borrower and the applicable Incremental Lenders providing such Incremental Commitments, and
except as otherwise set forth herein, to the extent not identical to the Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, each existing on the Incremental Facility Closing Date, shall be consistent with clauses (i) through
(iii) below, as applicable, and otherwise as reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (it being understood that covenants and defaults that are only applicable after the Latest Maturity Date at the time of such Incremental Facility
Closing Date shall be as agreed between the Borrower and the applicable Incremental Lenders and need not be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent); provided that in the case of a Term Loan Increase or a Revolving Commitment
Increase, the terms, provisions and documentation of such Term Loan Increase or a Revolving Commitment Increase shall be identical (other than with respect to upfront fees, original issue discount or similar fees) to the applicable Term Loans or
Revolving Credit Commitments being increased, in each case, as existing on the Incremental Facility Closing Date. In any event:  (i) the Incremental Term Loans:  (A) shall rank (I) pari
passu in right of payment and (II) pari passu or junior in right of security with the Revolving Credit Loans and the Term Loans (and, if applicable, shall be subject to a Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement), 
(B) as of the Incremental Facility Closing Date, shall not have a Maturity Date earlier than the Maturity Date with
respect to the Term Loans (prior to giving effect to any extensions thereof occurring after the Maturity Date), 
(C) shall have an amortization schedule as determined by the Borrower and the applicable new Lenders, provided
that, as of the Incremental Facility Closing Date, such Incremental Term Loans shall have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity not shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Term Loans (as originally in effect prior to any
amortization or prepayments thereto) on the date of incurrence of such Incremental Term Loans,  (D) shall have
an Applicable Rate and, subject to clauses (e)(i)(B) and (e)(i)(C) above and clause (e)(iii) below, amortization determined by the Borrower and the applicable Incremental Term Lenders, 
(E) shall have fees determined by the Borrower and the applicable Incremental Term Loan arranger(s), 
  79 


(F) may participate on a pro rata basis or less than or greater than a pro
rata basis in any voluntary repayments or prepayments of principal of Term Loans hereunder and on a pro rata basis or less than a pro rata basis (but not greater than a pro rata basis except in the case of a prepayment under
Section 2.06(b)(iii)(B)) in any mandatory repayments or prepayments of principal of Term Loans hereunder (or, if junior in right of security, shall be on a junior basis with respect thereto), and 
(G) may not be (x) secured by any assets other than Collateral or (y) guaranteed by any Person other than a
Guarantor.  (ii) the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments and Incremental Revolving Loans: 
(A) shall rank (I) pari passu in right of payment and (II) pari passu or junior in right of security
with the Revolving Credit Loans and the Term Loans (and, if applicable, be subject to a Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement),  (B) shall provide that the borrowing, prepayments and repayment (except for (1) payments of interest and fees at different rates on Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments (and related
outstandings), (2) repayments required upon the Maturity Date of the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments and (3) repayment made in connection with a permanent repayment and termination of commitments (subject to clause
(E) below)) of Loans with respect to Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments after the associated Incremental Facility Closing Date shall be made on a pro rata basis with all other Revolving Credit Commitments existing on the Incremental
Facility Closing Date,  (C) subject to the provisions of Sections 2.03(l) and 2.04(g) to the extent dealing
with Swing Line Loans and Letters of Credit which mature or expire after a Maturity Date when there exists Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments with a longer Maturity Date, all Swing Line Loans and Letters of Credit shall be participated on a
pro rata basis by all Lenders with Commitments in accordance with their percentage of the Revolving Credit Commitments existing on the Incremental Facility Closing Date (and except as provided in Section 2.03(l) and Section 2.04(g),
without giving effect to changes thereto on an earlier Maturity Date with respect to Swing Line Loans and Letters of Credit theretofore incurred or issued),  (D) may provide that the permanent repayment of Revolving Credit Loans with respect to, and termination or reduction of, Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments after the associated Incremental Facility
Closing Date be made on a pro rata basis or less than pro rata basis (but not greater than pro rata basis) with all other Revolving Credit Commitments existing on the Incremental Facility Closing Date, including, for the avoidance of doubt, on a
less than pro rata basis permitting the Borrower to permanently repay and terminate commitments of any earlier maturing Revolving Credit Commitments or Revolving Loans prior to the permanent repayment and termination of the applicable Incremental
Revolving Credit Commitments and Incremental Revolving Loans,  (E) shall provide that assignments and
participations of Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments and Incremental Revolving Loans shall be governed by the same assignment and participation provisions applicable to Revolving Credit Commitments and Revolving Credit Loans existing on the
Incremental Facility Closing Date,  (F) shall provide that any Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments may
constitute a separate Class or Classes, as the case may be, of Commitments from the Classes constituting the applicable Revolving Credit Commitments prior to the Incremental Facility Closing Date; provided at no time shall there be Revolving
Credit Commitments hereunder (including Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments and any original Revolving Credit Commitments) which have more than three (3) different Maturity Dates unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent,

  80 


(G) shall have an Applicable Rate determined by the Borrower and the
applicable Incremental Revolving Credit Lenders, subject to clause (e)(iii) below,  (H) shall have fees
determined by the Borrower and the applicable Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments arranger(s), and  (I)
may not be (x) secured by any asset other than Collateral or (y) guaranteed by any Person other than a Guarantor.  (iii) the All-In Yield applicable to the Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Loans of each Class shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable Incremental Lenders and shall be set
forth in each applicable Incremental Amendment; provided, however, that with respect to any Loans made under Incremental Term Commitments or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, in each case, that are secured on a pari
passu basis with the Obligations, the All-In Yield applicable to such Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Loans shall not be greater than the applicable All-In Yield payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as amended through
the date of such calculation with respect to Term B Loans or Revolving Credit Loans, as applicable, plus 50 basis points per annum unless the interest rate (together with, as provided in the proviso below, the Eurocurrency Rate or Base Rate floor)
with respect to the Term B Loans or Revolving Credit Loans, as applicable, is increased so as to cause the then applicable All-In Yield under this Agreement on the Term B Loans or Revolving Credit Loans, as applicable, to equal the All-In Yield then
applicable to the Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Loans, as applicable, minus 50 basis points; provided that any increase in All-In Yield to the Term B Loans or Revolving Credit Loans due to the application or imposition of a
Eurocurrency Rate or Base Rate floor on any Incremental Term Loan or Incremental Revolving Loan shall be effected solely through an increase in (or implementation of, as applicable) any Eurocurrency Rate or Base Rate floor applicable to the Term B
Loans or Revolving Credit Facility, as applicable, and in each case, solely to the extent that the application or imposition of such floor would cause an increase in the interest rate then in effect under the Term B Loans or Revolving Credit Loans,
as applicable.  (f) Incremental Amendment. Commitments in respect of Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Revolving
Credit Commitments shall become Commitments (or in the case of an Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment to be provided by an existing Revolving Credit Lender, an increase in such Lenders applicable Revolving Credit Commitment), under this
Agreement pursuant to an amendment (an Incremental Amendment) to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Incremental Lender providing such Commitments and the
Administrative Agent. The Incremental Amendment may, without the consent of any other Loan Party, Agent or Lender, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.16, including amendments as deemed necessary by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable judgment to effect any lien subordination and associated rights of
the applicable Lenders to the extent any Incremental Loans are to rank junior in right of security. The Borrower will use the proceeds of the Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments for any purpose not prohibited by this
Agreement. No Lender shall be obligated to provide any Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments unless it so agrees.  (g) Reallocation of Revolving Credit Exposure. Upon any Incremental Facility Closing Date on which Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments are effected through an increase in the Revolving Credit
Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.16, (a) if the increase relates to the Revolving Credit Facility, each of the Revolving Credit Lenders shall assign to each of the Incremental Revolving Credit Lenders, and each of the Incremental
Revolving Credit Lenders shall purchase from each of the Revolving Credit Lenders, at the principal amount thereof, such interests in the Incremental Revolving Loans outstanding on such Incremental Facility Closing Date as shall be necessary in
order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, such Revolving Credit Loans will be held by existing Revolving Credit Lenders and Incremental Revolving Credit Lenders ratably

  81 



in accordance with their Revolving Credit Commitments after giving effect to the addition of such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments to the Revolving Credit Commitments, (b) each
Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment shall be deemed for all purposes a Revolving Credit Commitment and each Loan made thereunder shall be deemed, for all purposes, a Revolving Credit Loan and (c) each Incremental Revolving Credit Lender
shall become a Lender with respect to the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments and all matters relating thereto. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the minimum borrowing and prepayment requirements in Section 2.02
and 2.06(a) of this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. 
(h) This Section 2.16 shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.14 or 10.01 to the contrary. 
Section 2.17. Refinancing Amendments.  (a) On one or more occasions after the Closing Date, the Borrower may obtain, from any Lender or any Additional Refinancing Lender, Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of all or any
portion of any Class of Term Loans and the Revolving Credit Loans (or unused Revolving Credit Commitments) then outstanding under this Agreement (which for purposes of this clause (a) will be deemed to include any then outstanding Extended Term
Loans, Other Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans), in the form of Other Term Loans, Other Term Loan Commitments, Other Revolving Credit Commitments or Other Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to a Refinancing Amendment; provided that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.17 or otherwise, (1) the borrowing and repayment (except for (A) payments of interest and fees at different rates on Other Revolving Credit Commitments (and related
outstandings), (B) repayments required upon the Maturity Date of the Other Revolving Credit Commitments and (C) repayment of principal made in connection with a permanent repayment and termination of commitments (subject to clause
(3) below)) of Loans with respect to Other Revolving Credit Commitments after the date of obtaining any Other Revolving Credit Commitments shall be made on a pro rata basis with all other Revolving Credit Commitments, (2) subject to the
provisions of Section 2.03(l) and 2.04(g) to the extent dealing with Swing Line Loans and Letters of Credit which mature or expire after a Maturity Date when there exist Extended Revolving Credit Commitments with a longer Maturity Date, all
Swing Line Loans and Letters of Credit shall be participated on a pro rata basis by all Lenders with Commitments in accordance with their percentage of the Revolving Credit Commitments (and except as provided in Section 2.03(l) and
Section 2.04(g), without giving effect to changes thereto on an earlier Maturity Date with respect to Swing Line Loans and Letters of Credit theretofore incurred or issued), (3) the permanent repayment of Revolving Credit Loans with
respect to, and termination of, Other Revolving Credit Commitments after the date of obtaining any Other Revolving Credit Commitments shall be made on a pro rata basis with all other Revolving Credit Commitments, except that the Borrower shall be
permitted to permanently repay and terminate commitments of any such Class on a better than a pro rata basis as compared to any other Class with a later Maturity Date than such Class of Other Revolving Credit Commitments or Revolving Credit
Commitments and (4) assignments and participations of Other Revolving Credit Commitments and Other Revolving Credit Loans shall be governed by the same assignment and participation provisions applicable to Revolving Credit Commitments and
Revolving Credit Loans.  (b) The effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction on the date
thereof of each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 and, to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, receipt by the Administrative Agent of (i) customary legal opinions, board resolutions and officers
certificates consistent with those delivered on the Closing Date (conformed as appropriate) other than changes to such legal opinions resulting from a change in law, change in fact or change to counsels form of opinion reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent and (ii) reaffirmation agreements and/or such amendments to the Collateral Documents as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent in order to ensure that such Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness
is provided with the benefit of the applicable Loan Documents.  (c) Each issuance of Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness
under Section 2.17(a) shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is (x) not less than $10,000,000 and (y) an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. 
(d) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended pursuant to a Refinancing
Amendment, without the consent of any other Lenders, to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to (i) reflect the existence and terms of the Credit Agreement 
  82 



Refinancing Indebtedness incurred pursuant thereto and (ii) effect such other amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable
opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.17, and the Required Lenders hereby expressly authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any such Refinancing Amendment. 
(e) This Section 2.17 shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.14 or 10.01 to the contrary. 
Section 2.18. Defaulting Lenders.  (a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting
Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:  (i) Waivers and Amendments. That Defaulting
Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 10.01. 
(ii) Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:
first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer or Swing Line
Lender hereunder; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, to be held as Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any
Swing Line Loan or Letter of Credit; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as
required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of
that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender,
the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under
this Agreement; and eighth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect
of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or L/C Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied
solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Borrowings owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other
amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.17(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting
Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  (iii) Certain Fees. That Defaulting Lender
(x) shall not be entitled to receive any commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.10(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been
required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender) and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive Letter of Credit fees as provided in Section 2.03(h). 
  83 


(iv) Reallocation of Pro Rata Share to Reduce Fronting Exposure.
During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each Non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans pursuant to Sections
2.03 and 2.04, the Pro Rata Share of each Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Loans and L/C Obligations shall be computed without giving effect to the Revolving Credit Commitment of that Defaulting Lender;
provided that (i) each such reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Default has occurred and is continuing; and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each
Non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) the Revolving Credit Commitment of that Non-Defaulting Lender minus
(2) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and the L/C Obligations of that Non-Defaulting Lender. 
(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender and each L/C Issuer agree in writing
in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any
conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the
Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Credit Loans of the applicable Facility and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in
accordance with their Pro Rata Share of the applicable Facility (without giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv)), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively
with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change
hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. 
ARTICLE III 
Taxes, Increased Costs Protection and Illegality  Section 3.01. Taxes.  (a) For purposes of this
Section 3.01, the term Lender includes each L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender.  (b) Any and all payments
by or on account of any obligation of Borrower (including any obligation that the Borrower may incur for the benefit of any of its Subsidiaries) under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required
by applicable law. If any applicable Law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely
pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such
deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or
withholding been made.  (c) The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
Law any Other Taxes imposed on the Borrower, and shall timely pay or reimburse any Recipient, as the case may be, for any Other Taxes paid or payable by such Recipient upon written demand (accompanied by a certificate complying with the requirements
set forth in clause (d) below) therefor.  (d) The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 Business Days after
written demand (accompanied by a certificate complying with the requirements set forth below) therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) payable or paid by such Recipient whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail a

  84 



description of such Indemnified Taxes and the amount of such payment or liability for Indemnified Taxes delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (e) Each Lender
shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 Business Days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the
Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.07(e) relating to the
maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the
Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the
Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).  (f) As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or
a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(g) (i) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such
Recipient becomes a Recipient under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that such Recipient
is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding Tax;  (ii) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is
legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from
time to time upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:  (A) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, duly executed
originals of IRS Form W-8BEN (or any successor form) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable
payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN (or any successor form) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax
treaty;  (B) duly executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor form); 
(C) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under
Section 881(c) or 871(h) of the Code, (x) a duly executed certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit T-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate) and (y) duly executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN (or any successor form); or  (D) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor form), accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a duly executed U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit T-2 
  85 



or Exhibit T-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or successor forms thereof or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a
partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a duly executed U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit
T-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;  (iii) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it
is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from
time to time upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly
completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; 
(iv) if a payment made to a Recipient under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by
FATCA if such Recipient were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Recipient shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under
FATCA and to determine that such Recipient has complied with such Recipients obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (iv), FATCA shall include
any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement; and  (v) on or before the date the
Administrative Agent becomes a party to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall provide to the Borrower two duly signed, properly completed copies of (i) IRS Form W-9 or any successor thereto, or (ii) (A) with respect to
payments received on the Administrative Agents own account, IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto, and (B) with respect to payments received on account of any Lender, a U.S. branch withholding certificate on IRS Form W-8IMY or any
successor thereto evidencing its agreement with the Borrower to be treated as a U.S. Person.  Each Recipient agrees that if
any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to
do so.  (h) If any Recipient determines, in its reasonable discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund
or overpayment credit in respect of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.01 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an
amount equal to such refund or credit (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund or credit), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified
party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund or credit). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the
amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund or credit to such
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would
place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund or credit had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed
and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its
Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
  86 


(i) Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation
of Section 3.01(a) with respect to such Lender it will, if requested by the Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts (subject to such Lenders overall internal policies of general application and legal and regulatory restrictions) to
designate another Lending Office for any Loan or Letter of Credit affected by such event; provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its Lending Office(s) to suffer no
economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section 3.01(i) shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Section 3.01(a).
 Section 3.02. Illegality.  If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make,
maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the applicable Eurocurrency Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such
Lender to make or continue any affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the
interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent
without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such
notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans
of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may
lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining
or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate with respect to any Base Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without
reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Each Lender
agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. Upon any such prepayment or
conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.  Section 3.03.
Inability to Determine Rates.  If the Required Lenders reasonably determine that for any reason in connection with any
request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount, currency and Interest Period of such
Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base
Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will
promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with
respect to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required
Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into
a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.  Section 3.04. Increased
Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy; Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans. 
  87 


(a) If any Lender reasonably determines that as a result of a Change in Law, there shall be
any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Loans or (as the case may be) issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such
Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (including any Taxes (other than (i) Indemnified Taxes or (ii) Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves,
other liabilities or capital attributable thereto and excluding for purposes of this Section 3.04(a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from reserve requirements contemplated by Section 3.04(b) or the definition of
Eurocurrency Rate), then from time to time within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail such increased costs (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with
Section 3.06), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.  (b) If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has
or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by it, or
participations in or issuance of Letters of Credit by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies
and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return (with a copy
of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower will pay to such Lender, as the case may be, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such reduction, such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
Section 3.05. Funding Losses.  Upon written demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, which demand shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount, the Borrower shall
promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense actually incurred by it as a result of:  (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day prior to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by
reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to
make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Eurocurrency Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or  (c) any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day prior to the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.07; 
including any loss or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits or margin) actually incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of funds
obtained by it to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.  Section 3.06. Matters Applicable to All Requests for Compensation. 
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any
Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such Lender shall use commercially reasonable efforts to designate a different
Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or issuing Letters of Credit hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such
designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts 
  88 



payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case,
would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material economic, legal or regulatory respect; provided, that nothing in this Section 3.06 shall
affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Section 3.04(a) or (b). 
(b) If any Lender requests compensation by the Borrower under Section 3.04, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy
to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans from one Interest Period to another Interest Period, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency Rate Loans, until the event or
condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect; provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested. 
(c) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03
or 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 or 3.04
for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the event giving rise to such claim and of such Lenders intention to claim
compensation therefor (except that, if the circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
Section 3.07. Replacement of Lenders under Certain Circumstances. 
If (i) any Lender ceases to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans as a result of any condition described in Section 3.02 or
Section 3.04, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, (iii) any Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender,
(iv) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, or (v) any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon five
(5) Business Days prior written notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent,  (x) require such Lender to
assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.07), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (or, with respect to clause
(iii) above, all of its interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Class of Loans or Commitments that is the subject of the related consent, waiver or amendment) and the related Loan Documents to one or more Eligible Assignees that
shall assume such obligations (any of which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that  (a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.07(b)(ii)(B);  (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the applicable outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower; 
(c) such Lender being replaced pursuant to this Section 3.07 shall (1) execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption
Agreement with respect to all, or a portion as applicable, of such Lenders Commitment and outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans, and (2) deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or
Administrative Agent (or a lost or destroyed note indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in lieu thereof); provided that the failure of any such Lender to execute an Assignment and Assumption Agreement
or deliver such Notes shall not render such sale and purchase (and the corresponding assignment) invalid and such assignment shall be recorded in the Register and the Notes shall be deemed to be canceled upon such failure; 
  89 


(d) the Eligible Assignee shall become a Lender hereunder and the assigning Lender shall
cease to constitute a Lender hereunder with respect to such assigned Loans, Commitments and participations, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive as to such assigning Lender; 
(e) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made
pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;  (f)
such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws;  (g) any Lender that acts as an L/C Issuer may not be replaced
hereunder at any time when it has any Letter of Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such L/C Issuer (including the furnishing of a back-up standby letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an
issuer, reasonably satisfactory to such L/C Issuer or the depositing of cash collateral into a cash collateral account in amounts and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such L/C Issuer) have been made with respect to each such
outstanding Letter of Credit; and  (h) the Lender that acts as the Administrative Agent cannot be replaced in its capacity as
Administrative Agent other than in accordance with Section 9.09,  or (y) terminate the Commitment of such Lender or L/C Issuer, as
the case may be, and (a) in the case of a Lender (other than an L/C Issuer), repay all Obligations owing to such Lender relating to the Loans and participations held by such Lender as of such termination date (including, if applicable, the fee
pursuant to Section 2.10(b)) and (b) in the case of an L/C Issuer, repay all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such L/C Issuer relating to the Loans and participations held by the L/C Issuer as of such termination date and Cash
Collateralize, cancel or backstop, or provide for the deemed reissuance under another facility, on terms reasonably satisfactory to such L/C Issuer any Letters of Credit issued by it; provided that in the case of any such termination of the
Commitment of a Non-Consenting Lender such termination shall be sufficient (together with all other consenting Lenders) to cause the adoption of the applicable departure, waiver or amendment of the Loan Documents and such termination shall, with
respect to clause (iii) above, be in respect of all of its interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Class of Loans or Commitments that is the subject of the related consent, waiver and amendment. 
In the event that (i) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent has requested that the Lenders consent to a departure or waiver of
any provisions of the Loan Documents or agree to any amendment thereto, (ii) the consent, waiver or amendment in question requires the agreement of each affected Lender or all the Lenders with respect to a certain Class or Classes of the Loans
and/or Commitments and (iii) the Required Lenders (or, in the case of a consent, waiver or amendment involving a certain Facility, the Required Facility Lenders) have agreed (but solely to the extent required by Section 10.01) to such
consent, waiver or amendment, then any Lender who does not agree to such consent, waiver or amendment shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Lender.  In connection with any such replacement, (i) if the Lender to be replaced is a Non-Consenting Lender, the Borrower shall pay to each Non-Consenting Lender, concurrently with the effectiveness of the
respective assignment, the fee set forth in Section 2.10(b) to the extent applicable and (ii) if any such Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender does not execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly executed Assignment and
Assumption Agreement reflecting such replacement within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the assignee Lender executes and delivers such Assignment and Assumption Agreement to such Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender, then such
Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Assumption Agreement without any action on the part of the Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender 
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
Section 3.08. Survival. 
  90 


All of the Borrowers obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of
the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and resignation of the Administrative Agent.

For purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on the
creation, incurrence, assumption or existence of Indebtedness, the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first incurred (whichever yi

inated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (i) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (ii) the
aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in connection with such refinancing. 
For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the creation, incurrence, assumption or existence of Indebtedness
determined by reference to the Permitted Non-Loan Party Indebtedness Amount, the Permitted Non-Loan Party Indebtedness Amount shall be calculated at the time of incurrence of such Indebtedness; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness of any Non-Loan Party under Sections 7.03(h)(B), (n), (w), (x) and (y)(i) or, with respect to Guarantees by any Non-Loan Party of Indebtedness of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor, Indebtedness of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor under Sections 7.03(h)(B), (n), (u), (w), (x) and (y)(i), and such refinancing would cause the Permitted Non-Loan Party Indebtedness Amount to be exceeded if calculated on the date of such refinancing, the
Permitted Non-Loan Party Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (i) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus
(ii) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in connection with such refinancing.
 The accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue
discount, and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness as the case may be, of the same class, accretion or amortization of original issue discount and increases in the amount of Indebtedness solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies, will, in each case, not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this Section 7.03. The principal amount of any non-interest bearing Indebtedness or other discount security
constituting Indebtedness at any date shall be the principal amount thereof that would be shown on a balance sheet of the Borrower dated such date prepared in accordance with GAAP.

payment of money in an aggregate amount exceeding the Threshold Amount is issued or levied against all or any material part of the property of the Loan Parties and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and such writ or warrant shall not

interest in any material portion of the Collateral purported to be covered thereby, subject to Permitted Liens, except to the extent that any such loss of perfection or priority results from the failure of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
Agent to maintain possession of certificates actually delivered to it representing securities pledged under the Collateral Documents or to file Uniform Commercial Code continuation statements and except as to Collateral consisting of real property
to the extent that such losses are covered by a lenders title insurance policy and such insurer has not denied coverage.

act of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the only Events of Default then having occurred
and continuing are pursuant to a failure to observe the Financial Covenant, the Administrative Agent shall only take the actions set forth in this Section 8.02 at the request of the Required Revolving Lenders (as opposed to Required Lenders)
under the Revolving Credit Facility.  Section 8.03. Exclusion of Immaterial Subsidiaries. 
Solely for the purpose of determining whether a Default has occurred under clause (f) of Section 8.01, any reference in such
clause to any Restricted Subsidiary or Loan Party shall be deemed not to include any Immaterial Subsidiary (it being agreed that all Immaterial Subsidiaries affected by any event or circumstance referred to in any such clause shall be considered
together, as a single consolidated Immaterial Subsidiary, for purposes of determining whether the condition specified above is satisfied).  Section 8.04. Application of Funds. 
  127



After the exercise of remedies provided for in Section 8.02 (or after the Loans have
automatically become immediately due and payable and the L/C Obligations have automatically been required to be Cash Collateralized as set forth in the proviso to Section 8.02), any amounts received on account of the Obligations shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent in the following order:  First, to payment of that portion of the
Obligations constituting fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts (other than principal and interest, but including Attorney Costs payable under Section 10.04 and amounts payable under Article III) payable to each of the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent in its capacity as such;  Second, to payment of that portion of the
Obligations constituting fees (other than commitment fees, letter of credit fees and facility fees), indemnities and other amounts (other than principal and interest) payable to the Lenders (including Attorney Costs payable under Section 10.04
and amounts payable under Article III), ratably among them in proportion to the amounts described in this clause Second payable to them;  Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid commitment fees, letter of credit fees, facilities fees and interest on the Loans and L/C Borrowings, ratably
among the Lenders in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third payable to them; 
Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid principal of the Loans and L/C
Borrowings, the Obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements and the Cash Management Obligations, ratably among the Lenders and the other Secured Parties in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held by them; 
Fifth, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuers, to Cash Collateralize that portion of L/C
Obligations comprised of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit;  Sixth, to the payment of
all other Obligations of the Loan Parties that are due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent
and the other Secured Parties on such date; and  Last, the balance, if any, after all of the
Obligations have been paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.  Subject to Section 2.03(c), amounts used to Cash
Collateralize the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause Fifth above shall be applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur. If any amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all
Letters of Credit have either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above and, if no Obligations remain outstanding, to the Borrower. 
Section 8.05. Borrowers Right to Cure.  (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 8.01 or Section 8.02, but subject to Sections 8.05(b) and (c), for the purpose of determining whether an Event of Default
under the Financial Covenant has occurred, the Borrower may on one or more occasions designate any portion of the Net Cash Proceeds from a sale or issuance of Qualified Equity Interests or of any contribution to the common capital of the Borrower
(or from any other contribution to capital or sale or issuance of any other Equity Interests on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) (the Cure Amount) as an increase to Consolidated EBITDA for the
applicable fiscal quarter; provided that such amounts to be designated (i) are actually received by the Borrower (x) on or after the first Business Day of the applicable fiscal quarter and (y) on or prior to the twentieth
(20th) day after the date on which financial statements are required to be delivered with respect to such applicable fiscal quarter (the Cure Expiration Date), (ii) do not exceed the maximum aggregate amount
necessary to cure any Event of Default under the Financial Covenant as of such date and (iii) the Borrower shall have provided notice (the Notice of Intent to 
  128




Cure) to the Administrative Agent on the date such amounts are designated as a Cure Amount (it being understood that to the extent such notice is provided in
advance of delivery of a Compliance Certificate for the applicable period, the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds that is designated as the Cure Amount may be lower than specified in such notice to the extent that the amount necessary to cure any
Event of Default under the Financial Covenant is less than the full amount of such originally designated amount). The Cure Amount used to calculate Consolidated EBITDA for one fiscal quarter shall be used and included when calculating Consolidated
EBITDA for each Test Period that includes such fiscal quarter. The parties hereby acknowledge that this Section 8.05(a) may not be relied on for purposes of calculating any financial ratios other than as applicable to the Financial Covenant
(and shall not be included for purposes of determining pricing, mandatory prepayments and the availability or amount permitted pursuant to any covenant under Article VII other than the Financial Covenant) and shall not result in any adjustment to
any amounts (including the amount of Indebtedness) or increase in cash with respect to the quarter with respect to which such Cure Amount was made other than the amount of the Consolidated EBITDA referred to in the immediately preceding sentence.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02, (A) upon designation of the Cure Amount by the Borrower, the Financial Covenant shall be deemed satisfied and complied with as of the end of the
relevant fiscal quarter with the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply with the Financial Covenant and any Event of Default under the Financial Covenant (and any other Default as a result thereof) shall be deemed not to have
occurred for purposes of the Loan Documents, and (B) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender may exercise any rights or remedies under Section 8.02 (or under any other Loan Document) on the basis of any actual or purported Event of
Default under the Financial Covenant (and any other Default as a result thereof) until and unless the Cure Expiration Date has occurred without the Cure Amount having been received by the Borrower. 
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.05(a), in each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters there shall be at least
two (2) fiscal quarters in which no cure set forth in Section 8.05(a) is made.  (c) There can be no more than five
(5) fiscal quarters in which the cure rights set forth in Section 8.05(a) are exercised during the term of the Revolving Credit Facility.  ARTICLE IX  Administrative Agent and Other Agents 
Section 9.01. Appointment and Authorization of Agents. 
(a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf
under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor
shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term agent herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to any Agent is not
intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an
administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.  (b) Each L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders
with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and each such L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Agents in this Article IX with respect to any acts
taken or omissions suffered by such L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term
Agent as used in this Article IX and in the definition of Agent-Related Person included such L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to such L/C
Issuer. 
  129



(c) The Administrative Agent shall also act as the collateral agent under the
Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders (in its capacities as a Lender, Swing Line Lender (if applicable), L/C Issuer (if applicable) and a potential Hedge Bank or Cash Management Bank) hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to act as the agent of (and to hold any security interest created by the Collateral Documents for and on behalf of or on trust for) such Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of
the Loan Parties to secure any of the Secured Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as collateral agent (and any co-agents, sub-agents
and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.02 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights
and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent), shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article IX (including, Section 9.07, as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the
collateral agent under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. 
Section 9.02. Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof)
granted under the Collateral Documents or of exercising any rights and remedies thereunder) by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact, such sub-agents as shall be deemed necessary by the Administrative Agent and shall be entitled to
advice of counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or sub-agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in
the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined in the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).  Section 9.03. Liability of Agents.  No Agent-Related Person shall
(a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct,
as determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any Lender or participant for any recital, statement, representation or
warranty made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in
connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the perfection or priority of any Lien or security interest
created or purported to be created under the Collateral Documents, or for any failure of any Loan Party or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation
to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any
Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof.  Section 9.04. Reliance by Agents. 
(a) Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have
been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by such Agent. Each Agent shall be fully justified
in failing or refusing to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by
the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders. 
  130



(b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in
Section 4.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or
satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its objection thereto.  Section 9.05. Notice of Default.  The Administrative Agent shall not
be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default. The Administrative Agent will notify the
Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to any Event of Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with Article VIII; provided that unless and until the
Administrative Agent has received any such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best
interest of the Lenders.  Section 9.06. Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Agents. 
Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by any Agent
hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as
to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to each Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their respective
Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower and the other Loan Parties hereunder. Each
Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and
decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by any Agent herein, such Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates which may come into the
possession of any Agent-Related Person.  Section 9.07. Indemnification of Agents. 
Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person
(to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any Loan Party to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by
it; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such Agent-Related Persons own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, as
determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be required by the Loan
Documents) shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section 9.07. In the case of any 
  131




investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Liabilities, this Section 9.07 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any
Lender or any other Person. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative
Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under,
this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower and without limiting the Borrowers
obligation to do so. The undertaking in this Section 9.07 shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations and the resignation of the Administrative Agent. 
Section 9.08. Agents in their Individual Capacities. 
The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire
Equity Interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with each of the Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates as though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative
Agent, the Swing Line Lender or an L/C Issuer hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Administrative Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan
Party or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information
to them. With respect to its Loans, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender
or an L/C Issuer, and the terms Lender and Lenders include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.  Section 9.09. Successor Agents.  The Administrative Agent may resign
as the Administrative Agent upon ten (10) days notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent is subject to an Agent-Related Distress Event, the Required Lenders may remove the Administrative Agent upon ten
(10) days notice. Upon the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall be consented to
by the Borrower (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed if such successor is a commercial bank with a combined capital and surplus of at least $1,000,000,000 that can act as a withholding agent for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes, and otherwise may be withheld at the Borrowers sole discretion) at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a) or (f). If no successor agent is appointed by the Required
Lenders prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor agent from among the Lenders; provided,
however, that if no successor agent has accepted appointment as the Administrative Agent by the date which is ten (10) days following the retiring Administrative Agents notice of resignation or the receipt by the Administrative
Agent of the notice of removal referred to above, as applicable, the retiring Administrative Agents resignation or removal, as the case may be, shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of
the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, the Person acting as such successor agent shall
succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term Administrative Agent, shall mean such successor administrative agent and/or supplemental administrative agent, as the case may be, and the
retiring Administrative Agents appointment, powers and duties as the Administrative Agent shall be terminated. After the retiring Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder as the Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Article IX and Sections 10.04 and 10.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent under this Agreement. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative
Agent hereunder by a successor and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto, and such amendments or supplements to the Mortgages, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or
desirable, or as the Required Lenders may request, in order to (a) continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the Collateral Documents or (b) otherwise ensure that the Collateral and Guarantee

  132




Requirement is satisfied, the Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges, and duties of the retiring Administrative
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder as the Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article IX shall continue in effect for its benefit
in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent. 
Section 9.10. Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. 
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or
other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:  (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file
such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(h) and (i), 2.10 and 10.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 
(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the
same;  and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is
hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount
due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Agents and their respective agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Section 2.10 and 10.04. 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.
 Section 9.11. Collateral and Guaranty Matters. 
The Lenders irrevocably agree:  (a) that any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document shall be automatically released (i) upon termination of the Aggregate
Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than (x) obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements not yet due and payable, (y) Cash Management Obligations not yet due and payable and (z) contingent indemnification
obligations not yet accrued and payable) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit (or upon cash collateralization of all Letters of Credit in a manner and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
or receipt of backstop letters of credit, in form and substance and from a financial institution, reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent), (ii) at the time the property subject to such Lien is transferred or to be transferred as
part of or in connection with any transfer permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document to any Person other than Holdings, the Borrower or any other Guarantor (whether as a Disposition or Investment), (iii) subject to
Section 10.01, if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, or (iv) if the property subject to such Lien is owned by a Guarantor, upon release of such Guarantor from its obligations
under its Guaranty pursuant to clause (c) below; 
  133



(b) to release or subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by
the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 7.01(i) or Section 7.01(p); and 
(c) that any Guarantor shall be automatically released from its obligations under the Guaranty if such Person ceases to be
a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of a transaction or designation permitted hereunder (including as a result of a Guarantor being redesignated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary); provided that no such release shall occur if such Guarantor
continues (after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction or designation) to be a guarantor in respect of any unsecured Indebtedness of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Indebtedness of the Borrower or any Subsidiary
Guarantor that is secured on a junior basis to the Obligations.  Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the
Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be required pursuant to Section 10.01) will confirm in writing the Administrative Agents authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property,
or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section 9.11. In each case as specified in this Section 9.11, the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative
Agent to), at the Borrowers expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release or subordination of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security
interest granted under the Collateral Documents, or to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 9.11. 
Section 9.12. Cash Management Obligations and Secured Hedge Agreements. 
Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein or in any Guaranty or any Collateral Document, no Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank that
obtains the benefits of Section 8.04, any Guaranty or any Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or of any Guaranty or any Collateral Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action
hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan
Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IX to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Cash Management
Obligations and Obligations arising under Secured Hedge Agreements unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the
applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be.  Section 9.13. Other Agents; Arrangers and
Managers.  None of the Lenders or other Persons identified on the facing page or signature pages of this Agreement as a
syndication agent, documentation agent, joint bookrunner or joint arranger shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to
all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders or other Persons so identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely,
on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.  Section 9.14. Appointment of Supplemental Administrative Agents. 
(a) It is the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall be no violation of any Law of any jurisdiction
denying or restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to transact business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in
particular in case of the enforcement of any of the Loan 
  134




Documents, or in case the Administrative Agent deems that by reason of any present or future Law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in
any of the other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to appoint an additional individual or institution selected by the Administrative
Agent in its sole discretion as a separate trustee, co-trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent, administrative sub-agent or administrative co-agent (any such additional individual or institution being referred to herein individually as a
Supplemental Administrative Agent and collectively as Supplemental Administrative Agents).  (b) In the event that the Administrative Agent appoints a Supplemental Administrative Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right, power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to the Administrative Agent with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and vest in such Supplemental Administrative Agent to the extent, and
only to the extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Administrative Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and
obligation contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance thereof by such Supplemental Administrative Agent shall run to and be enforceable by either the Administrative Agent or such Supplemental Administrative Agent,
and (ii) the provisions of this Article IX and of Section 10.04 and 10.05 that refer to the Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Administrative Agent and all references therein to the Administrative Agent
shall be deemed to be references to the Administrative Agent and/or such Supplemental Administrative Agent, as the context may require.  (c) Should any instrument in writing from the Borrower, Holdings or any other Loan Party be required by any Supplemental Administrative Agent so appointed by the Administrative Agent for more fully and
certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, the Borrower or Holdings, as applicable, shall, or shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly
upon request by the Administrative Agent. In case any Supplemental Administrative Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental
Administrative Agent, to the extent permitted by Law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental Administrative Agent. 
ARTICLE X 
Miscellaneous  Section 10.01. Amendments, Etc.  Except as otherwise set forth in
this Agreement, no amendment, modification, supplement or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing
signed by the Required Lenders (other than with respect to any amendment or waiver contemplated in clauses (g), (h) (in the case of clause (h), to the extent permitted by Section 2.16) or (i) below, which shall only require the
consent of the Required Facility Lenders under the applicable Facility or Facilities, as applicable) (or by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) and the Borrower or the other applicable Loan Party, as the case may be,
and each such waiver, amendment, modification, supplement or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided that no such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent
shall:  (a) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender (it
being understood that a waiver of any condition precedent set forth in Section 4.02 or the waiver of any Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of the Commitments shall not constitute an extension or increase of any Commitment of
any Lender);  (b) postpone any date scheduled for, or reduce the amount of, any payment of principal or
interest under Section 2.08 or 2.09 (other than pursuant to Section 2.09(b)) without the written consent of 
  135




each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, it being understood that the waiver of (or amendment to the terms of) any mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans shall not constitute a
postponement of any date scheduled for the payment of principal or interest and it further being understood that any change to the definition of Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, Total Net
Leverage Ratio or Interest Coverage Ratio, or, in each case, in the component definitions thereof, shall not constitute a reduction in any amount of interest;  (c) reduce or forgive the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on, any Loan or L/C Borrowing, or (subject to clause (iii) of the second proviso to this Section 10.01) any fees
or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, it being understood that any change to the definition of Total Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated
First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or Interest Coverage Ratio or, in each case, in the component definitions thereof shall not constitute a reduction in the rate; provided that only the consent of the
Required Lenders shall be necessary to amend the definition of Default Rate or to waive any obligation of the Borrower to pay interest at the Default Rate; 
(d) change any provision of this Section 10.01, the definition of Required Lenders, Required
Facility Lenders or Pro Rata Share or Section 2.07(c), 8.04 or 2.14 without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (it being understood that each Lender shall be directly and
adversely affected by a change to the Required Lenders or Pro Rata Share definitions);  (e) other than in connection with a transaction permitted under Section 7.04 or Section 7.05, release all or substantially all of the Collateral in any transaction or series of related

Section 4.02 as to any Credit Extension under one or more of the Revolving Credit Facility, a given Class of Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, a given Extension Series of Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or a given Class of Other
Revolving Credit Commitments) which directly affects Lenders under one or more of the Revolving Credit Facility, a given Class of Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, a given Extension Series of Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or a given
Class of Other Revolving Credit Commitments and does not directly affect Lenders under any other Facilities, in each case, without the written consent of the Required Facility Lenders under such applicable Facility or Facilities with respect to
Revolving Credit Commitments, a given Class of Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, a given Extension Series of Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or a given Class of Other Revolving Credit Commitments (and in the case of multiple Facilities
which are affected, such Required Facility Lenders shall consent together as one Facility); provided, however, that the waivers described in this clause (g) shall not require the consent of any Lenders other than the Required
Facility Lenders under such Facility or Facilities (it being understood that any amendment to the conditions of effectiveness of Incremental Commitments set forth in Section 2.16 shall be subject to clause (h) below)); 
(h) amend, waive or otherwise modify any term or provision (including the availability and conditions to funding under
Section 2.16 with respect to Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments and the rate of interest applicable thereto) which directly affects Lenders of one or more Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Credit
Commitments and does not directly affect Lenders under any other Facility, in each case, without the written consent of the Required Facility Lenders under such applicable Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments (and in
the case of multiple Facilities which are affected, such Required Facility Lenders shall consent together as one Facility); provided, however, that, to the extent permitted under Section 2.16, the waivers described in this clause

  136



(i) amend or otherwise modify: (a) the Financial Covenant, (b) the
exception set forth in Section 6.01(a)(y) (or in the comparable provision in the final paragraph of Section 6.01) and (c) Section 8.05, in each case or any definition related thereto (as any such definition is used therein) or
waive any Default resulting from a failure to perform or observe the Financial Covenant (including any related Default under Section 6.01) or Section 8.05 without the written consent of the Required Facility Lenders under the applicable
Facility or Facilities with respect to the Revolving Credit Commitments, a given Class of Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, a given Extension Series of Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or a given Class of Other Revolving Credit
Commitments (such Required Facility Lenders shall consent together as one Facility); provided, however, that the amendments, modifications or waivers described in this clause (i) to the extent related to either
Section 6.01(a)(y) (including the comparable provision in the final paragraph of Section 6.01), Section 8.05 or to compliance with the Financial Covenant (as opposed to Pro Forma Compliance with the Financial Covenant as a condition
to taking an action under this Agreement) shall not require the consent of any Lenders other than the Required Facility Lenders under such Facility or Facilities;  and provided, further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by each L/C Issuer in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or
duties of an L/C Issuer under this Agreement or any Letter of Credit Application relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by it; provided, however, that this Agreement may be amended to adjust the mechanics related to
the issuance of Letters of Credit, including mechanical changes relating to the existence of multiple L/C Issuers, with only the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the applicable L/C Issuer and the Borrower so long as the obligations of
the Revolving Credit Lenders, if any, who have not executed such amendment, and if applicable the other L/C Issuers, if any who have not executed such amendment, are not adversely affected thereby; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall,
unless in writing and signed by the Swing Line Lender in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Swing Line Lender under this Agreement; provided, however, that this Agreement may be amended to adjust
the borrowing mechanics related to Swing Line Loans, with only the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender and the Borrower so long as the obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders, if any, who have not executed such
amendment, are not adversely affected thereby; (iii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of, or any fees or other
amounts payable to, the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (iv) [Reserved]; (v) Section 10.07(h) may not be amended, waived or otherwise modified without the consent of each Granting Lender all or
any part of whose Loans are being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment, waiver or other modification; and (vi) the consent of the applicable Required Facility Lenders shall be required with respect to any amendment that by its terms
adversely affects the rights of Lenders under one or more Term Facilities (and in the case of multiple Term Facilities which are so adversely affected, such Required Facility Lenders shall consent together as one Term Facility) in respect of
payments hereunder in a manner different than such amendment affects other Term Facilities. Any such waiver and any such amendment, modification or supplement in accordance with the terms of this Section 10.01 shall apply equally to each of the
Lenders and shall be binding on the Loan Parties, the Lenders, the Agents and all future holders of the Loans and Commitments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any
amendment, waiver or consent hereunder, except that, without the consent of such Lender: (i) the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended and (ii) the principal of any Loan by such Lender may not be reduced or forgiven
(it being understood that any Commitments or Loans held or deemed held by any Defaulting Lender shall be excluded for a vote of the Lenders hereunder requiring any consent of the Lenders). 
No Lender consent is required to effect any amendment or supplement to any First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement or other intercreditor agreement or arrangement permitted under this Agreement (i) that is for the purpose of adding the holders of Permitted Pari Passu Secured Refinancing Debt, Permitted Junior Secured Refinancing
Debt, secured Incremental Equivalent Debt or other secured Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under Section 7.03 (or a Senior Representative with respect thereto) as parties thereto, as expressly contemplated by the terms of such First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, such Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement or such other intercreditor agreement or arrangement permitted under this Agreement, as applicable (it being understood that any such amendment or supplement may make such other
changes to the applicable intercreditor agreement as, in the good faith determination of the Administrative Agent, are required to effectuate the foregoing and provided, that such other changes are not adverse, in any material respect, to the
interests of the Lenders) or (ii) that is expressly contemplated by any First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any Second 
  137




Lien Intercreditor Agreement or other intercreditor agreement or arrangement permitted under this Agreement; provided, further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or
otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (a) to add one or
more additional credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents with the Term Loans and the Revolving Credit Loans and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (b) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders.
 In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended with the written consent of the Administrative
Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders providing the relevant Replacement Term Loans to permit the refinancing of all outstanding Term Loans of any Class (Refinanced Term Loans) with a replacement term loan tranche denominated
in Dollars (Replacement Term Loans) hereunder; provided that (a) the aggregate principal amount of such Replacement Term Loans shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Refinanced Term Loans plus
accrued interest, fees, premiums (if any) and penalties thereon and reasonable fees and expenses associated with such Replacement Term Loans, (b) the All-In Yield with respect to such Replacement Term Loans (or similar interest rate spread
applicable to such Replacement Term Loans) shall not be higher than the All-In Yield for such Refinanced Term Loans (or similar interest rate spread applicable to such Refinanced Term Loans) immediately prior to such refinancing unless the maturity
of the Replacement Term Loans is at least one year later than the maturity of the Refinanced Term Loans, (c) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Replacement Term Loans shall not be shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of
such Refinanced Term Loans (as originally in effect prior to any amortization or prepayments thereof) and (d) all other terms applicable to such Replacement Term Loans shall be substantially identical to, or less favorable to the Lenders
providing such Replacement Term Loans than, those applicable to such Refinanced Term Loans, except to the extent necessary to provide for covenants and other terms applicable to any period after the Latest Maturity Date in effect immediately prior
to such refinancing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.01, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may, without the input or consent of the Lenders, effect amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents as may be necessary or appropriate in the opinion of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to effect the provisions of this paragraph.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.01, guarantees, collateral security documents and related documents executed by any Guarantor in connection with this Agreement
may be in a form reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent and may be amended with the consent of the Administrative Agent at the request of the Borrower without the need to obtain the consent of any other Lender if such amendment is
delivered in order (i) to comply with local Law or advice of local counsel, (ii) to cure ambiguities or defects as set forth in the paragraph below or (iii) to cause such guarantee, collateral security document or other document to be
consistent with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  If the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall have jointly
identified an obvious error (including, but not limited to, an incorrect cross-reference) or any error or omission of a technical or immaterial nature, in each case, in any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any exhibit, schedule or other attachment to any Loan Document), then the Administrative Agent (acting in its sole discretion) and the Borrower or any other relevant Loan Party shall be permitted to amend such provision and such
amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Loan Document. Notification of such amendment shall be made by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders promptly upon such amendment becoming effective.

prepaid; (C) if delivered by facsimile, when sent and receipt has been confirmed by telephone; and (D) subject to Section 10.02(b)(ii) below, if delivered by electronic mail (which form of delivery is subject to the provisions of
Section 10.02(b)(ii), when delivered; provided that notices and other communications to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Article II shall not be effective until actually received by such
Person. In no event shall a voice mail message be effective as a notice, communication or confirmation hereunder.  (b) Electronic Communication.  (i) Notices and other
communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing
shall not apply to (x) notices to any Lender pursuant to Article II if such Lender, as applicable, has notified the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication
and (y) the issuance of Letters of Credit by Goldman Sachs Bank USA. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to
procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.  (ii) Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (x) notices and other communications set to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the senders receipt of an acknowledgement
from the intended recipient (such as by the return receipt requested function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement); provided, that if such notice or communication is not sent during normal business hours
of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient, and (y) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed
received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (x) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor. 
(c) Reliance by Agents and Lenders. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices
(including telephonic Committed Loan Notices and Swing Line Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by
any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify each Agent-Related Person and each Lender from all losses, costs, expenses
and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct. All telephonic notices to the Administrative Agent may be recorded
by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.

Section 10.03. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. 
No failure by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power
or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan Document, are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by Law.
 Section 10.04. Attorney Costs, Expenses and Taxes. 
The Borrower agrees (a) if the Closing Date occurs, to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent, Syndication Agent and the

negotiation, syndication and execution of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any amendment, waiver, consent or other modification of the provisions hereof and thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated thereby are

such costs and expenses incurred during any legal proceeding, including any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law, and including all Attorney Costs, which shall be limited to Attorney Costs of one counsel to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
taken as a whole (and, if necessary, one firm of local counsel to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders taken as a whole in any relevant jurisdiction and, solely in the event of any actual or potential conflict of interest, one additional counsel
in each relevant jurisdiction to each group of similarly situated affected persons taken as a whole)). The agreements in this Section 10.04 shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations. All
amounts due under this Section 10.04 shall be paid within thirty (30) days of receipt by the Borrower of an invoice relating thereto setting forth such expenses in reasonable detail; provided that, with respect to the Closing Date,
all amounts due under this Section 10.04 shall be paid on the Closing Date to the extent invoiced to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. If any Loan Party fails to pay when due any costs, expenses or
other amounts payable by it hereunder or under any Loan Document, such amount may be paid on behalf of such Loan Party by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion. This Section 10.04 shall not apply to Indemnified Taxes or Excluded
Taxes, which, in each case, shall be governed by Section 3.01. This Section 10.04 also shall not apply to taxes covered by Section 3.04.  Section 10.05. Indemnification by the Borrower.  Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person, each Lender and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents, trustees, investment advisors
and attorneys-in-fact (collectively the Indemnitees) from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements
(including Attorney Costs, but limited, in the case of legal fees and expenses, to the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, disbursements and other charges of one counsel to all Indemnitees taken as a whole and, if reasonably necessary, one
firm of local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction, and solely in the case of an actual or potential conflict of interest, one additional counsel in each relevant jurisdiction to each group of similarly situated affected Indemnitees) of any kind or
nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising out of or in connection with (a) the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance or administration of
any Loan Document or any other agreement, letter or instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (b) any Commitment, Loan or Letter of Credit or the
use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by an L/C Issuer to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do

  140




not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), or (c) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property currently or formerly owned or
operated by the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party, or (d) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or
proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory (including any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding) and regardless
of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the Indemnified Liabilities), in all cases, whether or not caused by or arising, in whole or in part, out of the negligence of the Indemnitee;
provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulted
from: (x) the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of, or material breach of Loan Document by, such Indemnitee or of any affiliate, director, officer, employee, counsel, agent or attorney-in-fact of such Indemnitee as determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision or (y) any dispute solely among Indemnitees that does not involve an act or omission by the Borrower or any of its Affiliates (other than any claims against an Indemnitee
in its capacity or in fulfilling its role as an administrative agent or arranger or any similar role under any Facility) (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction). No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of any information or other materials obtained through IntraLinks or other similar information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement (except
for damages resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision, of any such Indemnitee), nor shall any Indemnitee or any Loan Party have any
liability for any special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or arising out of its activities in connection herewith or therewith

party). In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 10.05 applies, such
indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Loan Party, its directors, stockholders or creditors or an Indemnitee or any other Person, whether or not any Indemnitee is otherwise a party
thereto and whether or not any of the transactions contemplated hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents is consummated. All amounts due under this Section 10.05 shall be paid within ten (10) Business Days after demand therefor;
provided, however, that such Indemnitee shall promptly refund such amount to the extent that there is a final judicial or arbitral determination that such Indemnitee was not entitled to indemnification or contribution rights with
respect to such payment pursuant to the express terms of this Section 10.05. The agreements in this Section 10.05 shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate
Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations. This Section 10.05 shall not apply to Taxes, other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim. 
Section 10.06. Payments Set Aside.  To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to any Agent or any Lender, or any Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff
or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver
or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full
force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by any
Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. 
Section 10.07. Successors and Assigns.  (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may

  141

construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in Section 10.07(f) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the
Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.  (b)(i) Subject to the
conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (other than to Disqualified Institutions and Defaulting Lenders) (Assignees) all or a portion of its rights and obligations

  142



(C) other than in the case of assignments pursuant to Section 10.07(m),
the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.  This
paragraph (b) shall not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Facilities on a non-pro rata basis.  (c) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 10.07(d) (and in the case of an Affiliated Lender or a Person that, after giving effect to such
assignment, would become an Affiliated Lender, to the requirements of Section 10.07(k)), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this
Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 10.04 and 10.05 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon
request, and the surrender by the assigning Lender of its Note, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
comply with this clause (c) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 10.07(e). 
(d) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative
Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered to it, each Affiliated Lender Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered to it, each notice of cancellation of any Loans delivered by the Borrower pursuant to
subsection (k) or (m) below, and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and related interest amounts) of the Loans, L/C Obligations (specifying the
Unreimbursed Amounts), L/C Borrowings and amounts due under Section 2.03, owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent
manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Agent and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Administrative Agent
be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender is an Affiliated Lender, nor shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to monitor the aggregate amount of the Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans held by Affiliated Lenders.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Loans, L/C Obligations and L/C Borrowings are intended to be treated as registered obligations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and this Section 10.07 shall be
construed so that the they are at all times maintained in registered form within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code, Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulation and any other related
regulations (or any successor provisions of the Code or such regulations).  (e) Any Lender may at any time, without the
consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lenders participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations
under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall
retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that directly and adversely affects such Participant. Subject to
Section 10.07(f), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to 
  143




the same extent as if it were a Lender (subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the limitations and requirements of those Sections applying to each Participant as if it were a Lender) and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 10.07(c) but shall not be entitled to recover greater amounts under such Sections than the selling Lender would be entitled to recover. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.14 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation
shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in
the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity
of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except (i) that the portion of the Participant Register
relating to a Participant shall be made available to the Borrower and Administrative Agent to the extent the benefits of this Agreement are claimed with respect to such Participant (including under Section 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05), or
(ii) otherwise to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code and
Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations and any other related regulations (or any successor provisions of the Code or such regulations). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error,
and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01, 3.04 or 3.05 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrower is
notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.01(g) as though it were a Lender. 
(g) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank having
jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a Granting Lender) may, without the
consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an SPC)
the option to provide all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, and
(ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. Each party hereto hereby agrees that
(i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement (including its obligations under
Section 3.01, 3.04 or 3.05), (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the
approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record hereunder. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent,
and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without prior consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and with the payment of a
processing fee of $3,500, assign all or any portion of its right to receive payment with respect to any Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any
rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. 
  144



(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (1) any Lender may,
without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, in accordance with applicable Law create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it and (2) any Lender that is a Fund may,
without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such
Fund as security for such obligations or securities; provided that unless and until such trustee actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this Section 10.07, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging
Lender from any of its obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect
to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.  (j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender may, upon thirty (30) days notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as an L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, respectively; provided that on or prior to the expiration of such 30-day
period with respect to such resignation, the relevant L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender shall have identified a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender reasonably acceptable to the Borrower willing to accept its appointment as successor L/C
Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as applicable. In the event of any such resignation of an L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders willing to accept such appointment a successor L/C Issuer or
Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of the relevant L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, except as expressly provided above. If
an L/C Issuer resigns as an L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations
with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). If the Swing Line Lender resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain
all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk
participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c).  (k) Any Lender may at any time, assign all
or a portion of its rights and obligations with respect to Term Loans under this Agreement to a Person who is or will become, after such assignment, an Affiliated Lender through (x) Dutch auctions or other offers to purchase open to all Lenders
on a pro rata basis in accordance with procedures of the type described in Section 2.06(a)(iv) or (y) open market purchase on a non-pro rata basis, in each case subject to the following limitations: 
(i) Affiliated Lenders will not receive information provided solely to Lenders by the Administrative Agent or any Lender
and will not be permitted to attend or participate in conference calls or meetings attended solely by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, other than the right to receive notices of prepayments and other administrative notices in respect of its
Loans or Commitments required to be delivered to Lenders pursuant to Article II;  (ii) each Affiliated Lender
that purchases any Term Loans pursuant to clause (x) above shall represent and warrant to the selling Lender (other than any other Affiliated Lender) that it does not possess material non-public information with respect to Holdings and its
Subsidiaries or the securities of any of them that has not been disclosed to the Lenders generally (other than Lenders who elect not to receive such information) or shall make a statement that such representation cannot be made; 
(iii) the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans of all Classes held at any one time by Affiliated Lenders shall not
exceed 25% of Term Loans of all Classes at such time outstanding (such percentage, the Affiliated Lender Cap); provided that to the extent any assignment to an Affiliated Lender would result in the aggregate
principal amount of Term Loans of all Classes held by Affiliated Lenders exceeding the Affiliated Lender Cap, the assignment of such excess amount will be void ab initio; 
(iv) the assigning Lender and the Affiliated Lender purchasing such Lenders Loans shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an assignment agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 hereto (an Affiliated Lender Assignment and Assumption Agreement); and 
  145



(v) as a condition to each assignment pursuant to this subsection (k), the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall have been provided a notice in the form of Exhibit E-3 hereto in connection with each assignment to an Affiliated Lender or a Person that upon effectiveness of such assignment would constitute an
Affiliate Lender pursuant to which such Affiliated Lender shall waive any right to bring any action in connection with such Term Loans against the Administrative Agent, in its capacity, as such; 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Affiliated Lender that has purchased Term Loans pursuant to this subsection
(k) may, in its sole discretion, contribute, directly or indirectly, the principal amount of such Term Loans, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to the Borrower for the purpose of cancelling and extinguishing such Term Loans. Upon
the date of such contribution, assignment or transfer, (x) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Term Loans shall reflect such cancellation and extinguishment of the Term Loans then held by the Borrower and (y) the Borrower shall
promptly provide notice to the Administrative Agent of such contribution of such Term Loans, and the Administrative Agent, upon receipt of such notice, shall reflect the cancellation of the applicable Term Loans in the Register. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the restrictions set forth in clauses (k)(i) and (iii) above shall not apply to any Affiliated Lenders that are the Sponsor if the aggregate Equity Interests of Holdings (or any direct or indirect
parent company thereof) collectively held by the Sponsor is less than 10% of the total Equity Interests of Holdings (or any direct or indirect parent company thereof) then issued and outstanding. 
Each Affiliated Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days) if it acquires any Person who becomes an Affiliated Lender by virtue of such acquisition, and each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) if it becomes
an Affiliated Lender. Such notice shall contain the type of information required and be delivered to the same addressee as set forth in Exhibit E-3 hereto. The Administrative Agent may conclusively rely upon any notice delivered pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence and/or pursuant to clause (v) of this subsection (k) and shall not have any liability for any losses suffered by any Person as a result of any purported assignment to or from an Affiliated Lender.
 (l) Notwithstanding anything in Section 10.01 or the definition of Required Lenders, or Required
Facility Lenders to the contrary, for purposes of determining whether the Required Lenders and Required Facility Lenders (in respect of a Class of Term Loans) have (i) consented (or not consented) to any amendment, modification, waiver,
consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of any Loan Document or any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, or subject to Section 10.07(o), any plan of reorganization pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, (ii) otherwise
acted on any matter related to any Loan Document, or (iii) directed or required the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under any Loan Document, no Affiliated Lender
shall have any right to consent (or not consent), otherwise act or direct or require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to take (or refrain from taking) any such action and: 
(i) all Term Loans held by any Affiliated Lenders shall be deemed to be not outstanding for all purposes of calculating
whether the Required Lenders and Required Facility Lenders (in respect of a Class of Term Loans) have taken any actions; and  (ii) all Term Loans held by Affiliated Lenders shall be deemed to be not outstanding for all purposes of calculating whether all Lenders have taken any action unless the action in question affects such
Affiliated Lender in a disproportionately adverse manner than its effect on other Lenders.  (m) Any Lender may, so long as no
Default has occurred and is continuing, at any time, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations with respect to Term Loans under this Agreement to Holdings or the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries through Dutch auctions or other offers
to purchase open to all Lenders on a pro rata basis in accordance with procedures of the type described in Section 2.06(a)(iv); provided, that:  (i) (x) if the assignee is Holdings or a Subsidiary of Borrower, upon such assignment, transfer or contribution, the applicable assignee shall automatically be deemed to have contributed or transferred
the principal amount of such Term Loans, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to the Borrower; or (y) if the assignee is the Borrower (including through contribution or transfers set forth in

  146




clause (x)), (a) the principal amount of such Term Loans, along with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, so contributed, assigned or transferred to the Borrower shall be deemed
automatically cancelled and extinguished on the date of such contribution, assignment or transfer, (b) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Term Loans of the remaining Lenders shall reflect such cancellation and extinguishment of the
Term Loans then held by the Borrower and (c) the Borrower shall promptly provide notice to the Administrative Agent of such contribution, assignment or transfer of such Term Loans, and the Administrative Agent, upon receipt of such notice,
shall reflect the cancellation of the applicable Term Loans in the Register;  (ii) each Person that purchases
any Term Loans pursuant to this subsection (m) shall represent and warrant to the selling Lender that it does not possess material non-public information with respect to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or the securities of any of them that
has not been disclosed to the Term Lenders generally (other than Term Lenders who elect not to receive such information) or shall make a statement that such representation cannot be made; and 
(iii) purchases of Term Loans pursuant to this subsection (m) may not be funded with the proceeds of Revolving Credit
Loans or Swing Line Loans.  (n) The aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans of the applicable Class shall be
deemed reduced by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans purchased by, or contributed to (in each case, and subsequently cancelled hereunder), by Holdings or its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 10.07(k) or
(m) and each principal repayment installment with respect to the Term Loans of such Class pursuant to Section 2.08(a)(i) shall be reduced pro rata by the par value of the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans so purchased or contributed
(and subsequently cancelled).  (o) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents to the contrary,
each Affiliated Lender hereby agrees that if a proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law shall be commenced by or against the Borrower or any other Loan Party at a time when such Lender is an Affiliated Lender, such Affiliated Lender shall vote with
respect to the Term Loans held by such Affiliated Lender, and is hereby deemed to vote, with respect to any plan of reorganization of such Loan Party in the same proportion as the allocation of voting with respect to such matter by all Lenders who
are not Affiliated Lenders; provided that such Affiliated Lender shall be entitled to vote in accordance with its sole discretion (and not in accordance with the allocation of voting with respect to such matter by all Lenders who are not
Affiliated Lenders) in connection with any plan of reorganization to the extent any such plan of reorganization proposes to treat any Obligations held by such Affiliated Lender in a disproportionately adverse manner to such Affiliated Lender than
the proposed treatment of similar Obligations held by Term Lenders that are not Affiliated Lenders.  Section 10.08.
Confidentiality.  Each of the Agents and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information, except
that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and its and its Affiliates directors, officers, employees, trustees, investment advisors and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that
the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any Governmental Authority; (c) to the extent
required by applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any other party to this Agreement; (e) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 10.08
(or as may otherwise be reasonably acceptable to the Borrower), to any pledgee referred to in Section 10.07(g), counterparty to a Swap Contract, Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in,
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement; (f) with the written consent of the Borrower; (g) to the extent such Information becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 10.08; (h) to
any Governmental Authority or examiner (including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar organization) regulating any Lender or its Affiliates; or (i) to any rating agency when required by it (it being
understood that, prior to any such disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake to preserve the confidentiality of any Information relating to the Loan Parties received by it from such Lender). In addition, the Agents and the Lenders may disclose
the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service 
  147




providers to the Agents and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Commitments and the Credit Extensions. For the
purposes of this Section 10.08, Information means all information received from any Loan Party relating to any Loan Party or its business, other than any such information that is publicly available to any Agent or any Lender prior
to disclosure by any Loan Party other than as a result of a breach of this Section 10.08.  Section 10.09.
Setoff.  In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, each Agent, each Lender and their respective Affiliates is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower or any other Loan Party, any such notice being waived by the Borrower
(on its own behalf and on behalf of each Loan Party) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other Indebtedness
at any time owing by, such Agent, such Lender and/or such Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all Obligations owing to such Agent, such Lender and/or such Affiliates hereunder or under any
other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not such Agent or such Lender or Affiliate shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured
or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or Indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set off and application made by such Lender; provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of each Agent and each Lender under this Section 10.09 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
that such Agent and such Lender may have.  Section 10.10. Interest Rate Limitation. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents
shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate). If any Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest
shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person
may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize,
prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.  Section 10.11. Counterparts.  This Agreement and each other Loan
Document may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery by telecopier, .pdf or other electronic imaging means of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement and each other Loan Document shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement and such other Loan Document. The Agents may also require that any such documents and
signatures delivered by telecopier, .pdf or other electronic imaging means be confirmed by a manually signed original thereof; provided that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any document or
signature delivered by telecopier, .pdf or other electronic imaging means.  Section 10.12. Integration.
 This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this
Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Agents or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with
the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof. 
  148



Section 10.13. Survival of Representations and Warranties. 
All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto
or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by each Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by any Agent
or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that any Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other
Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied (other than Obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements, Cash Management Obligations or contingent indemnification obligations, in any such case, not then due and payable) or any Letter of
Credit shall remain outstanding (unless the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations related thereto has been Cash Collateralized, back-stopped by a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer or deemed reissued under
another agreement reasonably acceptable to the applicable L/C Issuer).  Section 10.14. Severability. 
If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the legality, validity
and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction.  Section 10.15. Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents.
 The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in any Assignment and
Assumption Agreement or in any amendment or other modification hereof (including waivers and consents) shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect,
validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the 

BY APPLICABLE LAW.  Section 10.17. WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM
WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 10.17 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE
SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  Section 10.18. Binding Effect. 
This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and Holdings and the Administrative Agent shall
have been notified by each Lender, each L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender that each such Lender, each such L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, each
Agent, each Lender, each L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written
consent of the Lenders, except as permitted by Section 7.04(d).  Section 10.19. Lender Action. 
Each Lender agrees that it shall not take or institute any actions or proceedings, judicial or otherwise, for any right or remedy against
any Loan Party or any other obligor under any of the Loan Documents, the Secured Hedge Agreements or the agreements governing Cash Management Services (including the exercise of any right of setoff, rights on account of any bankers lien or
similar claim or other rights of self-help), or institute any actions or proceedings, or otherwise commence any remedial procedures, with respect to any Collateral or any other property of any such Loan Party, without the prior written consent of
the Administrative Agent. The provisions of this Section 10.19 are for the sole benefit of the Lenders and shall not afford any right to, or constitute a defense available to, any Loan Party. 
Section 10.20. USA PATRIOT Act. 
  150



Each Lender hereby notifies the Loan Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the USA
PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the Act), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Loan Parties, which information includes the name and
address of the Loan Parties and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Loan Parties in accordance with the Act.  Section 10.21. No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility.  In
connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), each of the Borrower and Holdings acknowledges and agrees, and
acknowledges its Affiliates understanding, that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Agents and the Joint Lead Arrangers are arms-length commercial transactions between the
Borrower, Holdings and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Joint Lead Arrangers, on the other hand, (B) each of the Borrower and Holdings has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax
advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) each of the Borrower and Holdings is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan
Documents; (ii) (A) the Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers and each Lender is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an

(the Borrower), BRIGHT HORIZONS CAPITAL CORP. (Holdings), the Subsidiaries of the Borrower party hereto from time to time, and GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA, as Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties.
 Reference is made to the Credit Agreement, dated as of January 30, 2013 (as amended, restated, extended, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement), among the Borrower, Holdings, each Lender from time to time party thereto, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, and L/C Issuer and the

maintain Cash Management Services on the terms and conditions agreed upon by the Borrower or the respective Restricted Subsidiary and such Cash Management Bank. The obligations of the Lenders to extend such credit, the obligation of the Hedge Banks
to enter into and/or maintain such Secured Hedge Agreements and the obligation of the Cash Management Banks to provide and/or maintain Cash Management Services are, in each case, conditioned upon, among other things, the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by each Guarantor. Holdings, the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors are affiliates of one another, are an integral part of a consolidated enterprise and will derive substantial direct and indirect benefits from (i) the
extensions of credit to the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement, (ii) the entering into and/or maintaining by the Hedge Banks of Secured Hedge Agreements with the Borrower and/or one or more of its Restricted Subsidiaries and
(iii) the providing and/or maintaining of Cash Management Services by the Cash Management Banks to the Borrower and/or one or more of its Restricted Subsidiaries, and are willing to execute and deliver this Agreement in order to induce the
Lenders to extend such credit, the Hedge Banks to enter into and/or maintain such Secured Hedge Agreements and the Cash Management Banks to provide and/or maintain such Cash Management Services. 
Accordingly, in consideration of the foregoing and other benefits accruing to each Guarantor, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, each Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees with each other Guarantor and the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties as follows:  ARTICLE XI  Definitions 
Section 11.01. Credit Agreement.  (a) Capitalized terms used in this Agreement, including the preamble and introductory paragraphs hereto, and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings specified in the Credit Agreement. 
(b) The rules of construction specified in Article I of the Credit Agreement also apply to this Agreement. 
Section 11.02. Other Defined Terms.  As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings specified below: 
Accommodation Payment has the meaning assigned to such term in Article III. 
Agreement means this Guaranty.  Allocable Amount has the meaning assigned to such term in Article III.  Credit Agreement has the meaning assigned to such term in the preliminary statement of this Agreement. 
  1 


Guaranteed Obligations mean the Obligations as defined in the
Credit Agreement.  Guarantor means each of Holdings, each Subsidiary Guarantor party hereto and each other
Person that becomes a party to this Agreement after the Closing Date pursuant to Section 4.14; provided that if any such Guarantor is released from its obligations hereunder as provided in Section 4.13, such Person shall cease to be
a Guarantor hereunder effective upon such release.  Guaranty Supplement means an instrument substantially
in the form of Exhibit I hereto.  Secured Credit Document shall mean each Loan Document, each Secured Hedge

Article III.  ARTICLE XII  Guarantee  Section 12.01. Guarantee. 
Each Guarantor irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, as a primary
obligor and not merely as a surety, the due and punctual payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, in each case, whether such Guaranteed Obligations are now existing or hereafter incurred under, arising out of or in connection with any
Secured Credit Document, and whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Each of the Guarantors further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended, increased, renewed, amended or modified, in whole or in part, without notice to,
or further assent from such Guarantor, and that such Guarantor will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension, increase, renewal, amendment or modification of any Guaranteed Obligation. Each of the Guarantors
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, presentment to, demand of payment from, and protest to, the applicable Guarantor or any other Loan Party of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and also waives, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, notice of acceptance of its guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment. 
Section 12.02. Guarantee of Payment.  Each of the Guarantors further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection, and, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, waives any
right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to any security held for the payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in favor of any Guarantor or any other Person. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or the Borrower and a separate
action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not action is brought against any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or the Borrower and whether or not any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or the Borrower be
joined in any such action or actions. Any payment required to be made by a Guarantor hereunder may be required by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party on any number of occasions. 
Section 12.03. No Limitations.  (a) Except for termination or release of a Guarantors obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section 4.13, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, but without prejudice to
Section 2.04, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be
subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or 
  2 



unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations, or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and except for termination or
release of a Guarantors obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms of Section 4.13, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged, impaired or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative
Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy under the provisions of any Secured Credit Document or otherwise; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from
any of the terms or provisions of, any Secured Credit Document or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement; (iii) the release of any security held by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party
for the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations; (v) the failure to perfect any security interest in, or the release of, any of the Collateral held
by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party; (vi) the lack of legal existence of the Borrower or any Guarantor or legal obligation to discharge any of the Guaranteed Obligations by Borrower or any Guarantor for any reason
whatsoever, including, without limitation, in any insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Loan Party; or (vii) any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise
operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (in each case, other than the payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations (other than (x) obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements not yet due and payable,
(y) Cash Management Obligations not yet due and payable and (z) contingent indemnification obligations not yet accrued and payable) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit (unless the Outstanding Amount of the L/C
Obligations related thereto have been Cash Collateralized, backstopped by a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer or deemed reissued under another agreement reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer). Each
Guarantor expressly acknowledges that the applicable Secured Parties may take and hold security for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, exchange, waive or release any or all such security (with or without consideration),
enforce or apply such security and direct the order and manner of any sale thereof in their sole discretion or release or substitute any one or more other guarantors or obligors upon or in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations all without affecting
the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Agreement shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would
not render its obligations under this Agreement subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States or any comparable provisions of any similar federal or state law.
 (b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and except for termination or release of a Guarantors obligations
hereunder in accordance with the terms of Section 4.13, but without prejudice to Section 2.04, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower of
any other Guarantor or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower or any other Guarantor, other than the payment in full of all the
Guaranteed Obligations (other than (x) obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements not yet due and payable, (y) Cash Management Obligations not yet due and payable and (z) contingent indemnification obligations not yet accrued and
payable) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit (unless the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations related thereto have been Cash Collateralized, backstopped by a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C
Issuer or deemed reissued under another agreement reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer). The Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties may in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Documents, at their election,
foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any other
accommodation with the Borrower or any Guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against the Borrower or any Guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent
the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full (other than (x) obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements not yet due and payable, (y) Cash Management Obligations not yet due and payable and (z) contingent indemnification
obligations not yet accrued and payable) and all Letters of Credit have expired or terminated (unless the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations related thereto have been Cash Collateralized, backstopped by a letter of credit reasonably
satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer or deemed reissued under another agreement reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such
election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any Guarantor, as the case may be, or
any security. 
  3 


Section 12.04. Reinstatement. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the Guarantors agrees that (i) its guarantee hereunder
shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party upon the
bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or any Guarantor or otherwise and (ii) the provisions of this Section 2.04 shall survive termination of this Agreement.  Section 12.05. Agreement To Pay; Subrogation.  In furtherance of the
foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Borrower or any Guarantor to pay any Guaranteed
Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent for
distribution to the applicable Secured Parties the amount of such unpaid Guaranteed Obligation. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any
Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subject to Article III.  Section 12.06. Information.  Each Guarantor assumes all
responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrowers and each Guarantors financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature,
scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties will have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to it or any of them
regarding such circumstances or risks.  ARTICLE XIII  Indemnity, Subrogation and Subordination  Upon payment by any Guarantor of
any Guaranteed Obligations, all rights of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and
junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations and the termination of all Commitments to any Loan Party under any Loan Document. If any amount shall erroneously be paid to the Borrower or any Guarantor on
account of (i) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii) any such indebtedness of the Borrower or any Guarantor, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall
promptly be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Subject to the foregoing,
to the extent that any Guarantor shall, under this Agreement, repay any of the Guaranteed Obligations (an Accommodation Payment), then the Guarantor making such Accommodation Payment shall be entitled to contribution and
indemnification from, and be reimbursed by, each of the other Guarantors in an amount equal to a fraction of such Accommodation Payment, the numerator of which fraction is such other Guarantors Allocable Amount and the denominator of which is
the sum of the Allocable Amounts of all of the Guarantors; provided that such rights of contribution and indemnification shall be subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations. As of any date of determination, the
Allocable Amount of each Guarantor shall be equal to the maximum amount of liability for Accommodation Payments which could be asserted against such Guarantor hereunder without (a) rendering such Guarantor
insolvent within the meaning of Section 101(31) of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA) or Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act
(UFCA), (b) leaving such Guarantor with unreasonably small capital or assets, within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA, or
(c) leaving such Guarantor unable to pay its debts as they become due within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States or Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA. 
  4 


ARTICLE XIV  Miscellaneous  Section 14.01. Notices. 
All communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in
Section 10.02 of the Credit Agreement. All communications and notices hereunder to any Guarantor shall be given to it in care of the Borrower as provided in Section 10.02 of the Credit Agreement. 
Section 14.02. Waivers; Amendment.  (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer, any Lender or any other Secured Party in exercising any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Secured Credit
Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, remedy, power or privilege or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right, remedy, power or privilege, preclude any other
or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges of the Secured Parties hereunder and under the other Secured Credit Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers or privileges provided by law. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section 4.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or the
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on any
Loan Party in any case shall entitle any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

Guarantor, in respect of any such damages incurred or paid by an Indemnitee to a third party).  (c) Any such amounts payable

certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by each Agent and the Lenders and shall survive the execution and delivery of the
Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any Agent or Lender or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or any Lender may have
had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default at the time any credit is extended under any Loan Document, and shall continue in full force and effect until this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 4.13 hereof, or with
respect to any individual Guarantor until such Guarantor is otherwise released from its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof.  Section 14.06. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Several Agreement.  This
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery by telecopier, .pdf or other electronic imaging means of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective as to any Guarantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such
Guarantor shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Guarantor and the Administrative Agent and their
respective permitted successors and assigns. The Administrative Agent may also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by telecopier, .pdf or other electronic imaging means be confirmed by a manually signed original thereof;
provided that the failure to request or delivery the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by telecopier, .pdf or other electronic imaging means. This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with
respect to each Guarantor and may be amended, restated, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Guarantor without the approval of any other Guarantor and without affecting the obligations of any other Guarantor hereunder.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the legality, validity and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired thereby. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 
Section 14.08. Right of Set-Off.  In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender and its Affiliates is authorized at any time and
from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower or any other Guarantor, any such notice being waived by the Borrower and each Guarantor to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final, at any time held by, and other Indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender and/or such Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all Guaranteed

contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or Indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set off and application made by such
Lender; provided, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of each Lender under this Section 4.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights
of setoff) that such Lender may have.  Section 14.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service

by a certificate and such certificate shall be delivered to the Collateral Agent pursuant to Sections 2.02(a) and (c). Each Grantor further acknowledges and agrees that with respect to any interest in any limited liability company or limited
partnership controlled on or after the date hereof by such Grantor and pledged hereunder that is not a security within the meaning of Article 8 of the UCC, such Grantor shall at no time elect to treat any such interest as a
security within the meaning of Article 8 of the UCC, nor shall such interest be represented by a certificate, unless such election and such interest is thereafter represented by a certificate that is promptly delivered to the

(a)(i) of this Section 2.06, and the obligations of the Collateral Agent under paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 2.06, shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall have the sole and
exclusive right and authority to exercise such voting and consensual rights and powers; provided that, unless otherwise directed by the Required Lenders, the Collateral Agent shall have the right from time to time following and during the
continuance of an Event of Default to permit the Grantors to exercise such rights. After all Events of Default have been cured or waived, each Grantor shall have the exclusive right to exercise the voting and/or consensual rights and powers that

the Grantors under paragraph (a)(i) or paragraph (a)(iii) in part without suspending all such rights (as specified by the Collateral Agent in its sole and absolute discretion) and without waiving or otherwise affecting the Collateral Agents
rights to give additional notices from time to time suspending other rights so long as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 2.06(a), (b) or (c), if a Bankruptcy Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent shall not be required to give any notice referred to in said Section in order to exercise any of its rights described in such Sections, and the suspension of the rights of each
of the Grantors under each such Section shall be automatic upon the occurrence of such Bankruptcy Event of Default.

be construed to make the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party liable as a member of any limited liability company or as a partner of any partnership and neither the Collateral Agent nor any other Secured Party by virtue of this Agreement or
otherwise (except as referred to in the following sentence) shall have any of the duties, obligations or liabilities of a member of any limited liability company or as a partner in any partnership. The parties hereto expressly agree that, unless the

business, and to defend the Security Interest of the Collateral Agent in the Article 9 Collateral (including without limitation the Pledged Securities) and the priority thereof against any Lien prohibited by Section 7.01 of the Credit
Agreement; provided that, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent any Grantor from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any of its assets or properties if such discontinuance is permitted by the Credit Agreement. 
(c) Each year, at the time of delivery of a Compliance Certificate pursuant to Section 6.02(a) of the Credit
Agreement, in connection with the delivery of annual financial statements with respect to the preceding fiscal year pursuant to Section 6.01 of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower shall deliver to the Collateral Agent a certificate executed by a
Responsible Officer of the Borrower setting forth the information required pursuant to Schedules 1(a), 1(c), 1(e), 1(f), 2(b), 7(a) and 7(b) of the Perfection Certificate or confirming that there has been no change in such information since the
date of such certificate or the date of the most recent certificate delivered pursuant to this Section 3.03(c).  (d) Subject to Section 3.03(h) and any other express limitation in this Agreement, the Borrower agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of each other Grantor, at its own expense, to execute,
acknowledge, deliver and cause to be duly filed all such further instruments and documents and take all such actions 
  16 



as the Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request to better assure, preserve, protect and perfect the Security Interest and the rights and remedies created hereby, including the
payment of any fees and Taxes required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the granting of the Security Interest and the filing of any financing statements (including fixture filings) or other documents in connection
herewith or therewith. If any amount payable under or in connection with any of the Article 9 Collateral (other than by a Loan Party) that exceeds $5,000,000 shall be or become evidenced by any promissory note or other instrument, such note or
instrument shall be promptly (and in any event within 30 days of its acquisition or such longer period as the Collateral Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion) pledged and delivered to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured
Parties, duly endorsed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.  (e) At its option, the
Collateral Agent may discharge past due taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances at any time levied or placed on the Article 9 Collateral and prohibited by Section 7.01 of the Credit Agreement, and may
pay for the maintenance and preservation of the Article 9 Collateral to the extent any Grantor fails to do so as required by the Credit Agreement or this Agreement and within a reasonable period of time after the Collateral Agent has requested
that it do so, and each Grantor jointly and severally agrees to reimburse the Collateral Agent within ten (10) Business Days after demand for any reasonable payment made or any reasonable out-of-pocket and documented expense incurred by the
Collateral Agent pursuant to the foregoing authorization; provided, however, the Grantors shall not be obligated to reimburse the Collateral Agent with respect to any Intellectual Property that any Grantor has failed to maintain or
pursue, or otherwise allowed to lapse, terminate or be put into the public domain in accordance with Section 4.02(f). Nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted as excusing any Grantor from the performance of, or imposing any
obligation on the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party to cure or perform, any covenants or other promises of any Grantor with respect to taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances and maintenance as set
forth herein or in the other Loan Documents.  (f) If at any time any Grantor shall take a security interest in
any property of an Account Debtor or any other Person the value of which exceeds $5,000,000 to secure payment and performance of an Account, such Grantor shall promptly assign such security interest to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
applicable Secured Parties, unless any such security interest constitutes an Excluded Asset. Such assignment need not be filed of public record unless necessary to continue the perfected status of the security interest against creditors of and
transferees from the Account Debtor or other Person granting the security interest.  (g) [Reserved.]

  17 


(h) Notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, none of
the Grantors shall be required, nor is the Collateral Agent authorized: (i) to perfect the Security Interests granted by this Agreement (including Security Interests in investment property and fixtures) by any means other than by:
(A) filings pursuant to the UCC in the office of the secretary of state (or similar central filing office) of the relevant State(s), and filings in the applicable real estate records with respect to any fixtures relating to Mortgaged
Properties, (B) filings in United States government offices with respect to Intellectual Property Collateral of any Grantor as expressly required elsewhere herein, (C) delivery to the Collateral Agent to be held in its possession of all
Collateral consisting of certificated securities or instruments as expressly required elsewhere herein or (D) other methods expressly provided herein, (ii) to perfect the security interest granted hereunder in any Letter-of-Credit Rights
with a maximum amount of less than $5,000,000 other than pursuant to the filings referred to in clause (i)(A) above, (iii) to perfect the security interest granted hereunder in motor vehicles, aircraft and other assets subject to certificates
of title, (iv) other than in respect of Pledged Collateral constituting certificated securities or uncertificated securities of wholly-owned Restricted Subsidiaries directly owned by the Borrower or any Grantor, to perfect the security
interests hereunder through control (including for the avoidance of doubt, to enter into any deposit account control agreement, securities account control agreement or any other control agreement with respect to any deposit account,
securities account or any other Collateral that requires perfection by control other than the Cash Collateral Account), (v) to complete any filings or other action with respect to the perfection of the security interests, including
of any Intellectual Property, created hereby in any jurisdiction outside of the United States or any State thereof, (vi) with respect to any Collateral, to perfect by possession of promissory notes or any other instruments evidencing an amount
not in excess of $5,000,000, (vii) to deliver any certificated securities except as expressly provided in Article II and (viii) to take any actions in any non-U.S. jurisdiction or required by the laws of any
non-U.S. jurisdiction to create any security interests in assets located or titled outside of the U.S. or to perfect any security interest in such assets, including any Intellectual Property registered in any non-U.S. jurisdiction (it
being understood that there shall be no security agreements or pledge agreements governed under the laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction).  Section 3.04. Other Actions. In order to further ensure the attachment, perfection and priority of, and the ability of the Collateral Agent to enforce, the Security Interest, each Grantor
agrees, in each case at such Grantors own expense, to take the following actions with respect to the following Article 9 Collateral:  (a) Instruments. If any Grantor shall at any time hold or acquire any Instruments constituting Collateral and evidencing an amount in excess of $5,000,000, such Grantor shall, within thirty
(30) days (or such longer period as the Collateral Agent may agree in its discretion), promptly endorse, assign and deliver the same to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the applicable Secured Parties, accompanied by such instruments of
transfer or assignment duly executed in blank as the Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request. 
  18 


(b) Investment Property. Except to the extent otherwise provided in
Article II: (i) if any Grantor shall at any time hold or acquire any certificated securities, such Grantor shall, within thirty (30) days (or such longer period as the Collateral Agent may agree in its discretion), endorse, assign and
deliver the same to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the applicable Secured Parties, accompanied by such instruments of transfer or assignment duly executed in blank as the Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request,
(ii) if any securities now or hereafter acquired by any Grantor are uncertificated and are issued to such Grantor or its nominee directly by the issuer thereof, upon the Collateral Agents request and following the occurrence of an Event
of Default such Grantor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent thereof and, at the Collateral Agents reasonable request, pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, either (A) cause
the issuer to agree to comply with instructions from the Collateral Agent as to such securities, without further consent of any Grantor or such nominee, or (B) arrange for the Collateral Agent to become the registered owner of the securities,
and (iii) if any securities, whether certificated or uncertificated, or other investment property are held by any Grantor or its nominee through a securities intermediary or commodity intermediary, upon the Collateral Agents request and
following the occurrence of an Event of Default, such Grantor shall immediately notify the Collateral Agent thereof and at the Collateral Agents request and option, pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Collateral Agent shall either (A) cause such securities intermediary or (as the case may be) commodity intermediary to agree to comply with entitlement orders or other instructions from the Collateral Agent to such securities intermediary as to
such security entitlements, or (as the case may be) to apply any value distributed on account of any commodity contract as directed by the Collateral Agent to such commodity intermediary, in each case without further consent of any Grantor or such
nominee, or (B) in the case of financial assets or other Investment Property held through a securities intermediary, arrange for the Collateral Agent to become the entitlement holder with respect to such Investment Property, with the Grantor
being permitted, only with the consent of the Collateral Agent, to exercise rights to withdraw or otherwise deal with such Investment Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral Agent agrees with each of the Grantors that the Collateral
Agent shall not give any such entitlement orders or instructions or directions to any such issuer, securities intermediary or commodity intermediary, and shall not withhold its consent to the exercise of any withdrawal or dealing rights by any
Grantor, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  (c) Commercial Tort Claims. If any
Grantor shall at any time after the date of this Agreement acquire a Commercial Tort Claim where the amount of damages claimed equals or exceeds $5,000,000 and for which a complaint in a 
  19 



court of competent jurisdiction has been filed, such Grantor shall within 30 days (or such longer period as the Collateral Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion) notify the Collateral
Agent thereof in a writing signed by such Grantor and provide supplements to Schedule 8 of the Perfection Certificate describing the details thereof and shall grant to the Collateral Agent a security interest therein and in the proceeds
thereof, all upon the terms of this Agreement.  (d) Letter of Credit Rights. If any Grantor is at any
time a beneficiary under a letter of credit with a stated amount of $5,000,000 or more, such Grantor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent thereof and, at the reasonable request of the Collateral Agent, such Grantor shall, pursuant to an
agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) arrange for the issuer and any confirmer of such letter of credit to consent to an assignment to the Collateral
Agent of the proceeds of any drawing under such letter of credit or (ii) arrange for the Collateral Agent to become the transferee beneficiary of such letter of credit, with the Collateral Agent agreeing, in each case, that the proceeds of any
drawing under the letter of credit shall be delivered to such Grantor or, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, applied as provided in this Agreement. 
ARTICLE IV 
Certain Provisions Concerning Intellectual Property Collateral 
Section 4.01. Grant of License to Use Intellectual Property. 
Without limiting the provisions of Section 3.01 hereof or any other rights of the Collateral Agent as the holder of a Security
Interest in any Intellectual Property Collateral, for the purpose of enabling the Collateral Agent to exercise rights and remedies under this Agreement at such time as the Collateral Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and
remedies, each Grantor shall, upon request by the Collateral Agent, grant to the Collateral Agent an irrevocable, non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the Grantors and exercisable only after the
occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default) to use, license or sublicense any of the Intellectual Property Collateral now owned or hereafter acquired by such Grantor, and wherever the same may be located, and including in such
license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof; provided, however, that any such license and any such license
granted by the Collateral Agent to a third party shall include reasonable and customary terms and conditions necessary to preserve the existence, validity and value of the affected Intellectual Property Collateral, including provisions requiring the
continuing confidential handling of trade secrets, requiring the use of appropriate notices and prohibiting the use of false notices, quality control and inurement provisions with regard to Trademarks, patent designation provisions with regard to
Patents, copyright notices and restrictions on decompilation and reverse engineering of copyrighted software (it being understood and agreed that, without limiting any other rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent under this Agreement, any other
Loan Document or applicable Law, nothing in the foregoing license grant shall be construed as granting the Collateral Agent rights in and to such Intellectual Property Collateral above and beyond (x) the rights to such Intellectual Property
Collateral that each Grantor has reserved for itself and (y) in the case of Intellectual Property Collateral that is licensed to any such Grantor by a third party, the extent to which such Grantor has the right to grant a sublicense to such
Intellectual Property Collateral hereunder). 
  20 


The use of such license by the Collateral Agent may only be exercised, at the option of the
Collateral Agent, during the continuation of an Event of Default; provided that any license, sublicense or other transaction entered into by the Collateral Agent in accordance herewith shall immediately terminate at such time as the
Collateral Agent is no longer lawfully entitled to exercise its rights and remedies under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 4.01 grants, or shall require a Grantor to grant, any license that is prohibited by applicable Law, or is
prohibited by, or constitutes a breach or default under or results in the termination of any existing or future contract, license, agreement, instrument or other document evidencing, giving rise to or theretofore granted, with respect to such
property or otherwise unreasonably prejudices the value thereof to the relevant Grantor. Without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding the existence of any Event of Default, any license rights granted under the Intellectual Property Collateral
hereunder are and shall be subject to all other license rights, existing or future, that are or will be granted by any Grantor to a third party. In the event the license set forth in this Section 4.01 is exercised with regard to any
Trademarks, then the following shall apply: (i) all goodwill arising from any licensed or sublicensed use of any Trademark shall inure to the benefit of the Grantor; (ii) the licensed or sublicensed Trademarks shall only be used in
association with goods or services of a quality and nature consistent with the quality and reputation with which such Trademarks were associated when used by Grantor prior to the exercise of the license rights set forth herein; and (iii) at the
Grantors request and expense, licensees and sublicensees shall provide reasonable cooperation in any effort by the Grantor to maintain the registration or otherwise secure the ongoing validity and effectiveness of such licensed Trademarks,
including, without limitation the actions and conduct described in Section 4.02 below.  Section 4.02.
Protection of Collateral Agents Security.  (a) Except to the extent permitted by
Section 4.02(f) below, or to the extent that failure to act, either individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to registration or pending application of each item of
its Intellectual Property Collateral for which such Grantor has standing to do so, each Grantor agrees to take, at its expense, all reasonable steps, including, without limitation, in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Copyright
Office and any other governmental authority located in the United States, to (i) maintain the validity and enforceability of any registered Intellectual Property Collateral and maintain such Intellectual Property Collateral in full force and
effect, and (ii) pursue the registration and maintenance of each Patent, Trademark, or Copyright registration or application, now or hereafter included in such Intellectual Property Collateral of such Grantor, including, withou

ions of this Agreement shall automatically apply
thereto, and (ii) any such After-Acquired Intellectual Property and, in the case of Trademarks, the goodwill symbolized thereby, shall automatically become part of the Intellectual Property Collateral subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement with respect thereto.  (e) [Reserved.] 
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement shall prevent any Grantor from abandoning or discontinuing the use or maintenance of any of its Intellectual Property Collateral or placing in the public domain, or from failing to take action to enforce license agreements or pursue
actions against infringers, if such Grantor determines in its reasonable business judgment that such abandonment, discontinuance, or failure to take action is desirable in the conduct of its business and Grantor shall not be required to take any
action hereunder (including notice to the Collateral Agent of any such Intellectual Property Collateral or such action). 
Section 4.03. After-Acquired Property. Except to the extent permitted by Section 4.02(f), promptly following delivery of
the annual update described in Section 3.03(c), each Grantor shall sign and deliver to the Collateral Agent an appropriate Security Agreement Supplement and related grant of security interest with respect all of its applicable Owned
Intellectual Property as of the last day of such period, to the extent that such Intellectual Property Collateral is not covered by any previous Security Agreement Supplement and related grant of security interests so signed and delivered by it. In
each case, it will promptly cooperate as reasonably necessary to enable the Collateral Agent to make any necessary or reasonably desirable recordations with the United States Copyright Office or the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as
appropriate. 
  22 


ARTICLE V  Remedies  Section 5.01. Remedies Upon Default. Upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, it is agreed that the Collateral Agent shall have the right to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party with respect to the Secured Obligations, as applicable, under the
UCC or other applicable Law, and also may (i) require each Grantor to, and each Grantor agrees that it will at its expense and upon request of the Collateral Agent, promptly assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by the Collateral
Agent and make it available to the Collateral Agent at a place and time to be designated by the Collateral Agent that is reasonably convenient to both parties; (ii) occupy any premises owned or, to the extent lawful and permitted, leased by any
of the Grantors where the Collateral or any part thereof is assembled or located for a reasonable period in order to effectuate its rights and remedies hereunder or under law, without obligation to such Grantor in respect of such occupation;
provided that the Collateral Agent shall provide the applicable Grantor with notice thereof prior to or promptly after such occupancy; (iii) exercise any and all rights and remedies of any of the Grantors under or in connection with the
Collateral, or otherwise in respect of the Collateral; provided that the Collateral Agent shall provide the applicable Grantor with notice thereof prior to or promptly after such exercise; (iv) withdraw any and all cash or other
Collateral from the Cash Collateral Account and to apply such cash and other Collateral to the payment of any and all Secured Obligations in the manner provided in Section 5.02 of this Agreement; (v) subject to the mandatory requirements
of applicable Laws and the notice requirements described below, sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral securing the Secured Obligations at a public or private sale or at any brokers board or on any securities exchange,
for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate; and (vi) with respect to any Intellectual Property Collateral, on demand, cause the Security Interest to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance
of any of or all such Intellectual Property Collateral (provided that no such demand may be made unless an Event of Default has occurred and has continued for thirty (30) days) by the applicable Grantors to the Collateral Agent, or license or
sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis, any such Intellectual Property Collateral throughout the world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the Collateral Agent shall
determine; provided, however, that such terms shall be subject to the provisions of Section 4.01 of this Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall be authorized at any sale of securities (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict
the prospective bidders or purchasers of such securities to Persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the Collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon
consummation of any such sale the Collateral Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold. Each such purchaser at any sale of Collateral shall hold the property sold
absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal which such Grantor now has or may at any time in the future
have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. 
  23 


The Collateral Agent shall give the applicable Grantors ten (10) days prior
written notice (which each Grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Collateral Agents intention to make any sale of Collateral. Such
notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a brokers board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on
which the Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix
and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Collateral Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion)
determine. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given. The Collateral Agent may, without
notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the
same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Collateral Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers
thereof, but the Collateral Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice.
At any public (or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, private) sale made pursuant to this Agreement, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or
appraisal on the part of any Grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by applicable Law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim
then due and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any
Grantor therefor. For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the Collateral Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor
shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Collateral Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the
Secured Obligations paid in full (in which case the applicable Grantors shall be entitled to the proceeds of any such sale pursuant to Section 5.02 hereof). As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the
Collateral Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a
proceeding by a court appointed receiver. Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.01 shall be deemed to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the New York UCC or its equivalent in
other jurisdictions.  Section 5.02. Application of Proceeds. The Collateral Agent shall apply the proceeds of any
collection or sale of Collateral, including any Collateral consisting of cash, in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.04 of the Credit Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any
such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any sale of Collateral by the Collateral Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the Collateral Agent
or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over
to the Collateral Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof. It is understood and agreed that the Grantors shall remain jointly and severally liable to the extent of any deficiency between the amount of the
proceeds of the Collateral and the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations. 
  24 


ARTICLE VI  [Reserved.]  ARTICLE VII 
Miscellaneous  Section 7.01. Notices. All communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in Section 10.02 of the Credit
Agreement. All communications and notices hereunder to any Grantor (other than the Borrower) shall be given to it in care of the Borrower as provided in Section 10.02 of the Credit Agreement. 
Section 7.02. Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay by the Collateral Agent, any L/C Issuer or any Lender in
exercising any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, remedy, power or privilege, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right, remedy, power or privilege, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges of the Collateral
Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any
departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 7.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Collateral Agent, any Lender or any
L/C Issuer may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on any Loan Party in any case shall entitle any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. 
(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or
agreements in writing entered into by the Collateral Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 10.01 of the
Credit Agreement.  Section 7.03. Collateral Agents Fees and Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The parties
hereto agree that the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to reimbursement of its expenses incurred hereunder as provided in Section 10.04 of the Credit Agreement. 
  25 


(b) Without limitation of its indemnification obligations under the other
Loan Documents, each Grantor jointly and severally agrees to indemnify the Collateral Agent and the other Indemnitees (as defined in Section 10.05 of the Credit Agreement) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including Attorney Costs but limited, in the case of legal fees and expenses, to the reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket fees, disbursements and other charges of one counsel to all Indemnitees taken as a whole and, if reasonably necessary, one firm of local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction, and solely in the case of an actual or potential conflict
of interest, one additional counsel in each relevant jurisdiction to each group of similarly situated affected Indemnitees) of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Indemnitee in
any way relating to or arising out of or in connection with the execution, delivery, performance, administration or e

t of a court of competent jurisdiction). No Grantor or Indemnitee shall have any liability for any special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages relating to this Agreement or arising
out of its activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether before or after the Closing Date) (other than, in the case of a Grantor, in respect of any such damages incurred or paid by an Indemnitee to a third party). 
(c) Any such amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional Secured Obligations secured hereby and by the other
Collateral Documents. The provisions of this Section 7.03 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and the repayment of any of the Secured Obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured
Party. All amounts due under this Section 7.03 shall be payable within ten Business Days of written demand therefor. 
  26 


Section 7.04. Successors and Assigns. Whenever in this Agreement any of the
parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the permitted successors and assigns of such party (including any successor or assignee of Holdings, which successor or assignee shall execute and deliver a joinder to this
Agreement in form reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent upon the reasonable request of the Collateral Agent) and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of any Grantor or the Collateral Agent that are contained in this
Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective permitted successors and assigns.  Section 7.05.
Survival of Agreement. Without limitation of any provision of the Credit Agreement or Section 7.03 hereof, all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Grantors in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or
other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by each Agent and the Lenders and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and
the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any Agent or Lender or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Collateral Agent, any L/C Issuer or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge
of any Default or Event of Default at the time any credit is extended under any Loan Document, and shall continue in full force and effect until this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 7.13 hereof, or with respect to any individual
Grantor until such Grantor is otherwise released from its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof. 
Section 7.06. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Several Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery by telecopier, .pdf or other electronic imaging means of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement shall
be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective as to any Grantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Grantor shall have been delivered to the Collateral Agent
and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Collateral Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Grantor and the Collateral Agent and their respective permitted successors and assigns. The Collateral Agent may also
require that any such documents and signatures delivered by telecopier, .pdf or other electronic imaging means be confirmed by a manually signed original thereof; provided that the failure to request or delivery the same shall not limit the
effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by telecopier, .pdf or other electronic imaging means. This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Grantor and may be amended, restated, modified, supplemented,
waived or released with respect to any Grantor without the approval of any other Grantor and without affecting the obligations of any other Grantor hereunder. 
  27 


Section 7.07. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired thereby. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Section 7.08. Right of Set-Off. 
In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law, but subject to Section 10.19 of the Credit Agreement, upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender and its Affiliates is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower or any other Grantor, any such notice being waived by the
Borrower and each Grantor to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other Indebtedness at any time owing by, such
Lender and/or such Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of the respective Grantors against any and all obligations owing to such Lender and/or such Affiliates hereunder, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not such Lender
or Affiliate shall have made demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or Indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify
the Borrower and the Collateral Agent after any such set off and application made by such Lender; provided, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of each Lender under

Law, all rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder, the Security Interest, the grant of a security interest in the Pledged Collateral and all obligations of each Grantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack

Section 2.04 of the Guaranty, any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Grantor in respect of the Secured Obligations or this Agreement. 
Section 7.13. Termination or Release. (a) This Agreement, the Security Interest and all other security interests granted
hereby shall terminate with respect to all Secured Obligations upon termination of the Aggregate Commitments, payment in full of all outstanding Secured Obligations (other than (x) obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements not yet due and
payable, (y) Cash Management Obligations not yet due and payable and (z) contingent indemnification obligations not yet accrued and payable) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit (unless the Outstanding Amount of the
L/C Obligations related thereto have been Cash Collateralized, backstopped by a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer or deemed reissued under another agreement reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer).
 (b) The Security Interest in any Collateral shall be automatically released in the circumstances set forth in

(e) In connection with any termination or release pursuant to
paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) the Collateral Agent shall promptly execute and deliver to any Grantor, at such Grantors expense, all documents (including relevant certificates, securities and other instruments) that such Grantor
shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or release and shall perform such other actions reasonably requested by such Grantor to effect such release, including delivery of certificates, securities and instruments. Any execution and
delivery of documents pursuant to this Section 7.13 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Collateral Agent.  (f) At any time that the respective Grantor desires that the Collateral Agent take any of the actions described in the immediately preceding paragraph (e), it shall, upon request of the Collateral
Agent, deliver to the Collateral Agent an officers certificate certifying that the release of the respective Collateral is permitted pursuant to paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d). The Collateral Agent shall have no liability whatsoever
to any Secured Party as the result of any release of Collateral by it as permitted (or which the Collateral Agent in good faith believes to be permitted) by this Section 7.13. 
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each Cash Management Bank and each Hedge Bank by
the acceptance of the benefits under this Agreement hereby acknowledge and agree that (i) the obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary under any Secured Hedge Agreement and the Cash Management Obligations shall be secured pursuant to this
Agreement only to the extent that, and for so long as, the other Secured Obligations are so secured and (ii) any release of Collateral effected in the manner permitted by this Agreement shall not require the consent of any Hedge Bank or Cash
Management Bank.  Section 7.14. Additional Restricted Subsidiaries. Pursuant to Section 6.11 of the Credit
Agreement, certain Restricted Subsidiaries of the Loan Parties that were not in existence or not Restricted Subsidiaries on the date of the Credit Agreement are required to enter in this Agreement as Grantors upon becoming Restricted Subsidiaries.
In addition, certain Restricted Subsidiaries of the Loan Parties that are not required under the Credit Agreement to enter in this Agreement as Grantors may elect to do so at their option. Upon execution and delivery by the Collateral Agent and a
Restricted Subsidiary of a Security Agreement Supplement, such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Grantor hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Grantor herein. The execution and delivery of any such instrument shall
not require the consent of any other Grantor hereunder. The rights and obligations of each Grantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Grantor as a party to this Agreement. 
Section 7.15. Collateral Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. Each Grantor hereby appoints the Collateral Agent the true and
lawful attorney-in-fact of such Grantor for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof
at any time after and during the continuance of an Event of 
  31 



Default, which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall have the right, upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default and (unless a Bankruptcy Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in which case no such notice shall be required) upon and after delivery of notice by the Collateral Agent to the Borrower of its intent
to exercise such rights, subject in each case to Section 5.01 of this Agreement, with full power of substitution either in the Collateral Agents name or in the name of such Grantor (a) to receive, endorse, assign and/or deliver any
and all notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money orders or other evidences of payment relating to the Collateral or any part thereof; (b) to demand, collect, receive payment of, give receipt for and give discharges and releases of all or any
of the Collateral; (c) to sign the name of any Grantor on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the Collateral; (d) to send verifications of Accounts to any Account Debtor; (e) to commence and prosecute any and all suits,
actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect or otherwise realize on all or any of the Collateral or to enforce any rights in respect of any Collateral; (f) to settle, compromise, compound, adjust
or defend any actions, suits or proceedings relating to all or any of the Collateral; (g) to notify, or to require any Grantor to notify, Account Debtors to make payment directly to the Collateral Agent or the Cash Collateral Account and
adjust, settle or compromise the amount of payment of any Account; and (h) to use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with all or any of the Collateral, and to do all other acts and things
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner of the Collateral for all purposes; provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring
or obligating the Collateral Agent to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the Collateral Agent, or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to the
Collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby. The Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts actually received as a result of the
exercise of the powers granted to them herein, and neither they nor their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct or that of any of their Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents or attorneys-in-fact. 
Section 7.16. General Authority of the Collateral Agent. By acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement and any other
Collateral Documents, each Secured Party (whether or not a signatory hereto) shall be deemed irrevocably (a) to consent to the appointment of the Collateral Agent as its agent hereunder and under such other Collateral Documents, (b) to
confirm that the Collateral Agent shall have the authority to act as the exclusive agent of such Secured Party for the enforcement of any provisions of this Agreement and such other Collateral Documents against any Grantor, the exercise of remedies
hereunder or thereunder and the giving or withholding of any consent or approval hereunder or thereunder relating to any Collateral or any Grantors obligations with respect thereto, (c) to agree that it shall not take any action to
enforce any provisions of this Agreement or any other Collateral Document against any Grantor, to exercise any remedy hereunder or thereunder or to give any consents or approvals hereunder or thereunder and (d) to agree to be bound by the terms
of this Agreement and any other Collateral Documents. 
  32 


Section 7.17. Collateral Agents Duties. To the extent permitted by law,
the Collateral Agents sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the New York UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as
the Collateral Agent deals with similar property for its own account. None of the Collateral Agent, any other Secured Party or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize
upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the
Collateral or any part thereof. The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties hereunder are solely to protect the Collateral Agents and the other Secured Parties interests in the Collateral and shall not
impose any duty upon the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to exercise any such powers. The Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such
powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct or that of their directors,
officers, employees or agents.  Section 7.18. Mortgages. In the event that any of the Collateral hereunder is also
subject to a valid and enforceable Lien under the terms of a Mortgage and the terms thereof are inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, then with respect to such Collateral, the terms of such Mortgage shall control in the case of Fixtures and
real estate leases, letting and licenses of, and contracts and agreements relating to the lease of, real property, and the terms of this Agreement shall control in the case of all other Collateral. 
Section 7.19. Recourse; Limited Obligations. This Agreement is made with full recourse to each Grantor and pursuant to and
upon all the warranties, representations, covenants and agreements on the part of such Grantor contained herein, in the Loan Documents and the Secured Hedge Agreements and otherwise in writing in connection herewith or therewith. It is the desire
and intent of each Grantor and the Secured Parties that this Agreement shall be enforced against each Grantor to the fullest extent permissible under the applicable Laws applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, and in furtherance of the foregoing, it is noted that the obligations of each Grantor that is a Subsidiary Guarantor have been limited as expressly provided in the Subsidiary Guaranty and are limited
hereunder as and to the same extent provided therein.

Borrower), BRIGHT HORIZONS CAPITAL CORP. (Holdings), the Subsidiaries of the Borrower identified therein and GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA, as Collateral Agent. 
A. Reference is made to (i) the Credit Agreement dated as of January 30, 2013 (as amended, restated, extended, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement), among the Borrower, Holdings, each Lender from time to time party thereto, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer and the
other agents and parties party thereto, (ii) the Guaranty (as defined in the Credit Agreement), (iii) each Secured Hedge Agreement (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (vi) the Cash Management Obligations (as defined in the Credit
agreement).  B. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms
in the Credit Agreement and the Security Agreement, as applicable.  C. The Grantors have entered into the Security Agreement in
order to induce (x) the Lenders to make Loans and the L/C Issuers to issue Letters of Credit, (y) the Hedge Banks to enter into and/or maintain Secured Hedge Agreements and (z) the Cash Management Banks to provide Cash Management
Services. Section 7.14 of the Security Agreement provides that additional Restricted Subsidiaries of the Borrower may become Grantors under the Security Agreement by execution and delivery of an instrument substantially in the form of this
Supplement. The undersigned Restricted Subsidiary (the New Subsidiary) is executing this Supplement in accordance with the Credit Agreement to become a Grantor under the Security Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to
make additional Loans and the L/C Issuers to issue additional Letters of Credit and as consideration for Loans previously made and Letters of Credit previously issued.  Accordingly, the Collateral Agent and the New Subsidiary agree as follows:  Section 1. In accordance with Section 7.14 of the Security Agreement, the New Subsidiary by its signature below becomes a Grantor under the Security Agreement with the same force and
effect as if originally named therein as a Grantor and the New Subsidiary hereby (a) agrees to all the terms and provisions of the Security Agreement applicable to it as a Grantor thereunder and (b) represents and warrants that the
representations and warranties made by it as a Grantor thereunder are true and correct in all material respects (except that any representation and warranty that is qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall
be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the date hereof; provided that, to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, they shall be true and correct in all material respects (except
that any representation and warranty that is qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct in all respects) as of such earlier date. In furtherance of the foregoing, the New Subsidiary, as
security for the payment and performance in full of the Secured Obligations does hereby create and grant to the Collateral Agent, its successors and assigns, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, their successors and assigns, a security interest
in and lien on all of the New Subsidiarys right, title and interest in and to the Collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement) of the New Subsidiary. Each reference to a Grantor in the Security Agreement shall be deemed to
include the New Subsidiary as if originally named therein as a Grantor. The Security Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference. 


Exhibit I to  the Security Agreement  Page 2 
  Section 2. The New Subsidiary
represents and warrants to the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties that (i) it has the power and authority to enter into this Supplement and (ii) this Supplement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by it and
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, general principles of equity and an implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing.  Section 3. This Supplement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery by telecopier, .pdf or other electronic imaging means of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Supplement shall be effective
as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Supplement. This Supplement shall become effective as to any New Subsidiary when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such New Subsidiary shall have been delivered to the Collateral Agent
and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Collateral Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such New Subsidiary and the Collateral Agent and their respective permitted successors and assigns. The Collateral Agent may
also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by telecopier, .pdf or other electronic imaging means be confirmed by a manually signed original thereof; provided that the failure to request or delivery the same shall not limit the
effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by telecopier, .pdf or other electronic imaging means. 
Section 4. The New Subsidiary hereby represents and warrants that a Perfection Certificate as to the New
Subsidiary has been duly executed and delivered to the Collateral Agent and the information set forth therein, including the legal name of the New Subsidiary, its jurisdiction of formation and the location of its chief executive office, is correct
in all material respects as of the date hereof.  Section 5. Except as expressly supplemented
hereby, the Security Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.  Section 6. THIS
SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
Section 7. If any provision of this Supplement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the legality,
validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Supplement shall not be affected or impaired thereby. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction.  Section 8. All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as
provided in Section 7.01 of the Security Agreement.  Section 9. The New Subsidiary agrees to
reimburse the Collateral Agent, on the same terms and to the same extent as provided for in section 7.03 of the Security Agreement, for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with this Supplement, including all Attorney Costs of counsel
for the Collateral Agent.

 [Letter of Credit Application] 


[Annex A]  [Describe Letter of Credit to be amended.] 


EXHIBIT I  January 30, 2013  To the Agent and each Lender party to 
the Credit Agreement referred to below  Ladies
and Gentlemen:  We have acted as counsel to the Loan Parties (as defined below) in connection with the Credit Agreement, dated as of the date
hereof (the Credit Agreement), among Bright Horizons Family Solutions LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Company), Bright Horizons Capital Corp., a Delaware corporation (Holdings),
the Lenders from time to time party thereto, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent (in such capacities, the Agent), and as Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and the other agents named therein.
Capitalized terms that are used and not defined in this opinion letter have the meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement.  This opinion
letter is furnished to you pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(v) of the Credit Agreement. The Subsidiaries of the Company listed in Parts A and B of Schedule 1 hereto are referred to herein respectively as the Delaware LLC
Guarantors and the California Corporate Guarantor. The Subsidiary of the Company listed on Schedule 2 hereto is referred to herein as the Other Guarantor. Holdings, the Delaware LLC Guarantors and the
California Corporate Guarantor are referred to herein collectively as the Covered Guarantors. The Company, the Covered Guarantors and the Other Guarantor are referred to herein collectively as the Loan Parties.
 In connection with this opinion letter, we have examined the following documents (unless otherwise noted, each dated as of the date hereof):
 (a) the Credit Agreement; 
(b) the Notes (if any) being delivered on the date hereof; 
(c) the Guaranty;  (d) the Security Agreement;  (e) the Copyright Security Agreement
(as defined in the Security Agreement);  (f) the Trademark Security Agreement (as defined in the Security
Agreement); and  (g) the Intercompany Note.  The agreements referred to in clauses (a) through (g) above are referred to herein collectively as the Credit Documents. The agreements referred to in clauses (d) through
(f) above are referred to herein collectively as the Collateral Documents. 








The Agent, et al.
  
January 30, 2013   We have examined such certificates, documents and records and have made such investigation of fact and such examination of law as we have deemed appropriate in order to enable us to render the opinions
set forth herein. In conducting such investigation of fact, we have relied, without independent verification, upon certificates of officers of the Loan Parties and one or more of their Subsidiaries, public officials and other appropriate Persons.
 In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed that the Other Guarantor (a) is validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, (b) has the power to execute and deliver each of the Credit Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder and (c) has duly authorized, executed and delivered each of the Credit
Documents to which it is a party.  The opinions expressed herein are limited to matters governed by the laws of the State of New York, the
Delaware General Corporation Law, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, the California Corporations Code, and the federal laws of the United States of America (collectively, the Covered Laws), and in the case of paragraph 10
below, Article 9 of the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code (the Delaware UCC), and in the case of paragraph 11 below, Division 9 of the California Uniform Commercial Code (the California UCC). Our opinion set
forth in paragraph 12 below is limited to the effect of Article 8 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code (the New York UCC).  Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth below, we are of the opinion that: 
1. Holdings (a) is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and (b) has the
corporate power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each of the Credit Documents to which it is a party. Each of the Company and the Delaware LLC Guarantors (a) is a limited liability company validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and (b) has the power under its limited liability company agreement and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each of the Credit
Documents to which it is a party. The California Corporate Guarantor (a) is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California and (b) has the corporate power to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under each of the Credit Documents to which it is a party.  2. Each of the Company and the Covered Guarantors has
duly authorized, executed and delivered each of the Credit Documents to which it is a party.  3. With the exception of the
Intercompany Note, each of the Credit Documents constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each of the Loan Parties party thereto and is enforceable against each such Loan Party in accordance with its terms. 
4. The execution and delivery by each of the Company and the Covered Guarantors of the Credit Documents to which such Person is a party
and the performance by such Person of 








The Agent, et al.
  
January 30, 2013   
its obligations thereunder will not violate or require the repurchase of securities under the charter, by-laws or the limited liability company agreement, as applicable, of such Person. The
execution and delivery by each Loan Party of the Credit Documents to which such Person is party and the performance by such Person of its obligations thereunder will not violate any Covered Laws. 
5. Except as may be required in order to perfect the Liens contemplated by the Collateral Documents, under the Covered Laws, no consent,
approval, license or exemption by, or order or authorization of, or filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority is required to be obtained or made by any of the Loan Parties in connection with the execution and delivery of the
Credit Documents to which such Person is party or the performance by such Person of its obligations thereunder.  6. We are not
representing any of the Loan Parties in any pending litigation in which it is a named defendant that challenges the validity or enforceability of, or seeks to enjoin the performance of, the Credit Documents. 
7. None of the Loan Parties is required to be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended.  8. Assuming that the proceeds of the Term Loans are applied in the manner contemplated by, and subject to the
limitations contained in, the Credit Agreement, neither the making of the Term Loans under the Credit Agreement on the date hereof, nor the application of the proceeds thereof, will violate Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.  9. The Security Agreement creates a valid security interest as security for the Secured Obligations
(as defined in the Security Agreement) in favor of the Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties in the Collateral described therein to the extent that a security interest in such Collateral can be created under Article 9 of the New York UCC.
 10. Upon the proper filing of the financing statements attached as Schedule 3 hereto in the office of the Secretary of State
of Delaware (the Delaware Filing Office), the security interests in the Collateral granted under the Security Agreement by each of the Loan Parties organized in the State of Delaware will be perfected to the extent a security
interest in such Collateral can be perfected under Article 9 of the Delaware UCC by the filing of a financing statement in the Delaware Filing Office.  11. Upon the proper filing of the financing statement attached as Schedule 4 hereto in the office of the Secretary of State of California (the California Filing Office), the security
interests in the Collateral granted under the Security Agreement by each of the Loan Parties organized in the State of California will be perfected to the extent a security interest in such Collateral can be perfected under Division 9 of the
California UCC by the filing of a financing statement in the California Filing Office. 








The Agent, et al.
  
January 30, 2013  
12. Assuming the delivery to the Agent in the State of New York of the certificates representing the Pledged Equity listed on Schedule 5
hereto indorsed to the Agent or in blank pursuant to the Security Agreement, and assuming that neither the Agent nor the Lenders have notice of an adverse claim (as defined in Section 8-105 of the New York UCC) with respect to such
Pledged Equity at the time such Pledged Equity is delivered to the Agent, the respective security interests in such Pledged Equity created in favor of the Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties under the Security Agreement constitute perfected
security interests in such Pledged Equity, free of any adverse claim (within the meaning of Section 8-303 of the New York UCC).  Our opinions set forth above are subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and
(ii) general principles of equity.  We express no opinion with respect to the applicability of Section 548 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code or any comparable provision of state law or the enforceability of the provisions contained in Section 2.03(a) of the Guaranty which purport to limit the obligations of any Guarantor thereunder or the effect of the unenforceability of such
provisions on the enforceability of the Guaranty.  Our opinions are also subject to the qualification that the enforceability of provisions in
the Credit Documents providing for indemnification or contribution, broadly worded waivers, waivers of rights to damages or defenses, waivers of unknown or future claims, and waivers of statutory, regulatory or constitutional rights may be limited
on statutory or public policy grounds. In addition, we express no opinion as to the enforceability of (i) rights of setoff, (ii) rights to receive prepayment premiums or the unaccrued portion of original issue discount upon acceleration,
in each case to the extent determined to be unreasonable or to constitute a penalty or unmatured interest, or (iii) any provision requiring that any action be brought only in the courts of a particular jurisdiction. In connection with the
provisions of the Credit Documents whereby the parties submit to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, we note the limitations of 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1332 on subject matter
jurisdiction of the federal courts. In connection with the provisions of the Credit Documents concerning personal jurisdiction and venue, we note that under NYCPLR § 510 a New York State court has discretion to transfer the place of trial, and
under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) a United States District Court has discretion to transfer an action to another district or division where it might have been brought.  In addition, certain provisions contained in the Credit Documents may be further limited or rendered unenforceable by applicable law, but in our opinion the inclusion of such provisions in the Credit
Documents does not render the Credit Documents invalid as a whole or substantially interfere with the practical realization of the principal benefits intended to be provided thereby. 








The Agent, et al.
  
January 30, 2013   We express no opinion as to (i) the existence of, or the title of any Person who has granted a security interest in any Collateral to, any item of Collateral or (ii) except to the extent set
forth in paragraphs 10 through 12 above, the perfection of, or except to the extent set forth in paragraph 12 above, the priority of, any security interest in any Collateral. We express no opinion with respect to (a) security interests in any
commercial tort claims or (b) the extent to which the grant (or purported grant) of a security interest in any asset subject to a legal or contractual restriction on the creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in
such asset is effective or violates any agreement to which any Loan Party is a party, except to the extent such restriction is rendered ineffective by Section 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the New York UCC. 
We call your attention to the fact that your security interest in certain Collateral described in the Security Agreement may not be able to be perfected
by the filing of financing statements and that under certain circumstances, the filings referred to in paragraphs 10 and 11 may become ineffective as a result of changes occurring after the date hereof and will terminate after five years after the
original filing date unless appropriate continuation statements are duly filed. In addition, Section 552 of the Bankruptcy Code limits the extent to which property acquired by a debtor after the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code
may be subject to a lien resulting from any security agreement entered into by the debtor before the commencement of the case.  This opinion
letter is furnished only to the addressees and is solely for their benefit and the benefit of their assignees who become Lenders under the Credit Agreement; provided, that (i) no assignee shall have any greater rights with respect to
this opinion letter than the original addressees hereof, (ii) no reissuance of this opinion letter shall be deemed to have occurred subsequent to the date hereof by reason of any such assignment, (iii) no such assignment shall be deemed to
extend any statute of limitations period applicable on the date hereof and (iv) all rights hereunder with respect to any particular claim or related claims may be asserted only in a single proceeding with respect to such claim or related claims
by and through the Agent or the Required Lenders. This opinion may not be relied upon for any other purpose or by any other Person without our prior written consent. 
 




Very truly yours,

distribution of any kind or character (other than payments and distributions with regard to Restructured Debt Securities) shall be made by or on behalf of the Affected Payor or any other Person on its behalf, and no payment or distribution of any

shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness (or their representatives), ratably according to the respective aggregate amounts remaining unpaid thereon, to the extent necessary for all Senior Indebtedness
of the relevant Affected Payor to be Paid in Full.  For purposes of
this Note, Paid in Full means that the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be paid in full in cash in respect of all amounts constituting Senior Indebtedness (other than Obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements, Cash
Management Obligations or contingent indemnification obligations, in any such case, not then due and payable) and no Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding (unless the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations related thereto has been Cash
Collateralized, back-stopped by a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer or deemed reissued under another agreement reasonably acceptable to the applicable L/C Issuer). 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, no present or future holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be prejudiced in its right to enforce the subordination
of this Note by any act or failure to act on the part of any Affected Payor or by any act or failure to act on the part of such holder or any trustee or agent for such holder. Each Affected Payee and each Affected Payor hereby agrees that the
subordination of this Note is for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties, the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties are obligees under this Note to the same extent as if their names were written herein as such and
the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent may, on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties, proceed to enforce the subordination provisions herein.  Subject to all Senior Indebtedness being Paid in Full, each Affected Payee shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of assets of the
respective Affected Payor applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until all amounts owing on the Note shall be paid in full, and for the purpose of such subrogation no payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness by or on behalf
of an Affected Payor or by or on behalf of the holder of the Note which otherwise would have been made to the holder of the Note shall, as between such Affected Payor, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the holder of
the Note, be deemed to be payment by such Affected Payor to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness.  The holders of the
Senior Indebtedness may, without in any way affecting the obligati

al amount of any intercompany loans between them.  Each Payee is hereby authorized (but not required) to record all loans and advances made by it to any Payor (all of which shall be evidenced by this Note), and all repayments or prepayments thereof, in
its books and records, such books and records constituting prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information contained therein. 
Each Payor hereby waives presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind in connection with this Note. All payments under this Note shall be made
without offset, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.  This Note shall be binding upon each Payor and its successors and permitted assigns,
and the terms and provisions of this Note shall inure to the benefit of each Payee and its successors and permitted assigns, including subsequent holders hereof.  From time to time after the date hereof, and as may be reflected on the Schedule, any successor to any Payee or Payor hereunder and additional Subsidiaries of Holdings may become parties hereto (as Payor
and/or Payee, as the case may be) by executing a counterpart signature page to this Note (each successor and additional Subsidiary, an Additional Party). Upon delivery of such counterpart signature page to the Payees,
notice of which is hereby waived by the other Payors and Payees, each Additional Party shall be a Payor and/or a Payee, as the case may be, and shall be as fully a party hereto as if such Additional Party were an original signatory hereof. Each
Payor expressly agrees that its obligations arising hereunder shall not be affected or diminished by the addition or release of any other Payor or Payee hereunder. This Note shall be fully effective as to any Payor or Payee that is or becomes a
party hereto regardless of whether any other Person becomes or fails to become or ceases to be a Payor or Payee hereunder.  Indebtedness
governed by this Note shall be maintained in registered form within the meaning of Section 163(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No transfer of this Note shall be effective until entered in a register (the
Register).  THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

Section 1.03), if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First-Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made in
respect of any Shared Collateral in any Bankruptcy Case of the Borrower or any other Grantor or any First-Lien Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than this Agreement) with respect to any Shared
Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First-Lien Secured Party on account of such enforcement of rights or remedies or received by the Controlling
Collateral Agent or any First-Lien Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement with respect to such Shared Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution (subject, in the case of any such distribution, to the sentence immediately
following) to which the First-Lien Obligations are entitled under any intercreditor agreement (other than this Agreement) (all proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any Collateral and all proceeds of any such distribution being
collectively referred to as Proceeds), shall be applied (i) FIRST, to the payment of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent and Authorized Representative (each in its capacity as such) pursuant to the terms of any Secured

to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Shared Collateral or Proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First-Lien Obligations with respect to which such Impairment exists. 
(b) Notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens securing any Series of
First-Lien Obligations granted on the Shared Collateral and notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial Code of any jurisdiction, or any other applicable law or the Secured Credit Documents or any defect or deficiencies in the Liens
securing the First-Lien Obligations of any Series or any other circumstance whatsoever (but, in each case, subject to Section 1.03), each First-Lien Secured Party hereby agrees that the Liens securing each Series of First-Lien Obligations on
any Shared Collateral shall be of equal priority. 


(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other First-Lien Security Documents to
the contrary, Collateral consisting of cash and cash equivalents pledged to secure Credit Agreement Obligations consisting of reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit or otherwise held by the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent
pursuant to Sections 2.03(a)(ii), 2.03(b)(iii), 2.03(g), 2.03(l), 2.04(a), 2.06(b)(vi), 2.06(c), 2.18, 3.07(x)(g) or 3.07(y) or Article VIII of the Credit Agreement (or any equivalent successor provision) shall be applied as specified in
the Credit Agreement and will not constitute Shared Collateral.  SECTION 2.02 Actions with Respect to Shared Collateral;
Prohibition on Contesting Liens.  (a) Only the Controlling Collateral Agent shall act or refrain from acting with respect
to any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral). At any time when the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent, no Additional First-Lien Secured
Party shall or shall instruct any Collateral Agent to, and neither the Additional Collateral Agent nor any other Collateral Agent that is not the Controlling Collateral Agent shall, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with
respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security
interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under any Additional First-Lien
Security Document, applicable law or otherwise, it being agreed that only the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, acting in accordance with the Credit Agreement Collateral Documents, shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such
remedies with respect to Shared Collateral at such time.  (b) With respect to any Shared Collateral at any time when the
Additional Collateral Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent, (i) the Controlling Collateral Agent shall act only on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, (ii) the Controlling Collateral Agent shall not follow
any instructions with respect to such Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral) from any Non-Controlling Authorized Representative (or any other First-Lien Secured Party other
than the Applicable Authorized Representative) and (iii) no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other First-Lien Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) shall or shall instruct the Controlling Collateral
Agent to, commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or
power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with
respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under any First-Lien Security Document, applicable law or otherwise, it being agreed that only the Controlling Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative and in
accordance with the applicable Additional First-Lien Security Documents, shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such remedies with respect to Shared Collateral. 


(c) Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens securing each Series of First-Lien
Obligations, the Controlling Collateral Agent may deal with the Shared Collateral as if such Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party will
contest, protest or object (or support the challenge of any other Person) to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Parties or any other
exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Parties of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral, or to cause the Controlling Collateral Agent to do so. The
foregoing shall not be construed to limit the rights and priorities of any First-Lien Secured Party, any Collateral Agent or any Authorized Representative with respect to any Collateral not constituting Shared Collateral. 
(d) Each of the First-Lien Secured Parties (and each Authorized Representative) agrees that it will not (and hereby waives any right to)
question or contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the
First-Lien Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of this Agreement; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent or impair the rights of any Collateral Agent or any Authorized
Representative to enforce this Agreement.  (e) Each of the Authorized Representatives agrees that it will not accept any Lien
on any Collateral for the benefit of any Series of First-Lien Obligations (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of any Additional First-Lien Document, to the extent permitted by the applicable Secured Credit Documents) other
than pursuant to the First-Lien Security Documents to which it is a party and pursuant to Sections 2.03(a)(ii), 2.03(b)(iii), 2.03(g), 2.03(l), 2.04(a), 2.06(b)(vi), 2.06(c), 2.18, 3.07(x)(g) or 3.07(y) or Article VIII (or other similar
provisions) of the Credit Agreement, and by executing this Agreement (or a Joinder Agreement), each Authorized Representative and the Series of First-Lien Secured Parties for which it is acting hereunder agree to be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement and the other First-Lien Security Documents applicable to it.  SECTION 2.03 No Interference; Payment Over.
 (a) Each First-Lien Secured Party agrees that (i) it will not challenge or question in any proceeding the validity or
enforceability of any First-Lien Obligations of any Series or any First-Lien Security Document or the validity, attachment, perfection or priority of any Lien under any First-Lien Security Document or the validity or enforceability of the
priorities, rights or duties established by, or other provisions of, this Agreement; (ii) it will not take or cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or could be, to interfere, hinder or delay, in any manner, whether by
judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shared Collateral by the Controlling Collateral Agent, (iii) except as provided in Section 



2.02, it shall have no right to (A) direct the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First-Lien Secured Party to exercise, and shall not exercise, any right, remedy or power with respect
to any Shared Collateral (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement) or (B) consent to the exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First-Lien Secured Party of any right, remedy or power with respect to any Shared
Collateral, (iv) it will not institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First-Lien Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by
way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral, and none of the Controlling Collateral Agent, any Applicable Authorized Representative or any other First-Lien Secured Party shall be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by the Controlling Collateral Agent, such Applicable Authorized Representative or other First-Lien Secured Party with respect to any Shared Collateral in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (v) it will
not seek, and hereby waives any right, to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral and (vi) it will not attempt, directly or indirectly, whether by judicial
proceedings or otherwise, to challenge the enforceability of any provision of this Agreement; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent or impair the rights of any of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other
First-Lien Secured Party to enforce this Agreement.  (b) Each First-Lien Secured Party hereby agrees that if it shall obtain
possession of any Shared Collateral or shall realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Shared Collateral, pursuant to any First-Lien Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the Discharge of each of the First-Lien Obligations, then it shall hold such Shared Collateral,
proceeds or payment in trust for the other First-Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the Controlling Collateral Agent in the same form as received, with any necessary
endorsements or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.01 hereof.  SECTION 2.04 Automatic Release of Liens.  (a) If, at any time the
Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in
favor of each other Collateral Agent for the benefit of each Series of First-Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously be released and discharged as and when, but only to the extent, such
Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and discharged; provided that any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be applied pursuant to Section 2.01. 
(b) Each Collateral Agent and Authorized Representative agrees to execute and deliver all such authorizations and other instruments as
shall reasonably be requested by the Controlling Collateral Agent to evidence and confirm any release of Shared Collateral provided for in this Section. 


SECTION 2.05 Certain Agreements with Respect to Bankruptcy or Insolvency Proceedings.
 (a) This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding. The parties hereto acknowledge that the provisions of this Agreement are intended to be enforceable as contemplated by Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.  (b) If the Borrower and/or any other Grantor shall become subject to a case (a Bankruptcy Case) under the Bankruptcy Code and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of
financing (DIP Financing) to be provided by one or more lenders (the DIP Lenders) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law or the use of cash
collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law, each First-Lien Secured Party (other than any Controlling Secured Party or the Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured
Party) agrees that it will raise no objection to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (DIP Financing Liens) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the
Controlling Collateral Agent (in the case of the Additional Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash
collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect
to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First-Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP
Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First-Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such
Shared Collateral as set forth herein), in each case so long as (A) the First-Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising
after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other First-Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First-Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the
commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, (B) the First-Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any First-Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP
Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-à-vis the First-Lien Secured Parties as set forth in this Agreement, (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First-Lien
Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to Section 2.01, and (D) if any First-Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash
collateral, the proceed

, that the First-Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First-Lien Secured Party receiving adequate
protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First-Lien Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral.  SECTION 2.06 Reinstatement. In the event that any of the First-Lien Obligations shall be paid in full and such payment or any part thereof shall subsequently, for whatever reason (including an
order or judgment for disgorgement of a preference under the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar law, or the settlement of any claim in respect thereof), be required to be returned or repaid, the terms and conditions of this Article II shall be
fully applicable thereto until all such First-Lien Obligations shall again have been paid in full in cash. This Section 2.06 shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 
SECTION 2.07 Insurance. As between the First-Lien Secured Parties, the Controlling Collateral Agent shall have the right to adjust
or settle any insurance policy or claim covering or constituting Shared Collateral in the event of any loss thereunder and to approve any award granted in any condemnation or similar proceeding affecting the Shared Collateral. 
SECTION 2.08 Refinancings, etc. The First-Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the then
existing Secured Credit Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, Refinanced (in whole or in part) or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, in each case, without notice
to, or the consent (except to the extent a consent is otherwise required to permit the Refinancing transaction under any Secured Credit Document) of any First-Lien Secured Party of any other Series, all without affecting the priorities provided for
herein or the other provisions hereof; provided that the Authorized Representative of the holders of any such Refinancing indebtedness shall have executed a Joinder Agreement on behalf of the holders of such Refinancing indebtedness.
 SECTION 2.09 Control Collateral Agent as Gratuitous Bailee for Perfection. 
(a) The Control Collateral shall be delivered, or control thereof transferred, to the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and the Credit
Agreement Collateral Agent agrees to hold (and, pending delivery or transfer of control of the Control Collateral to the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, each other Collateral Agent agrees to hold) any Shared Collateral constituting Control
Collateral that is part of the Collateral in its possession or control (or in the possession or control of its agents or bailees) as gratuitous bailee for the benefit of each other First-Lien Secured Party and any assignee solely for the purpose of
perfecting the security interest granted in such Control Collateral, if any, pursuant to the applicable First-Lien Security Documents, in 



each case, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.09; provided that at any time the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent is not the Controlling Collateral Agent, the
Credit Agreement Collateral Agent shall, at the request of the Additional Collateral Agent, promptly deliver or transfer control of all Control Collateral to the Additional Collateral Agent together with any necessary endorsements (or otherwise
allow the Additional Collateral Agent to obtain possession or control of such Control Collateral). The Borrower shall take such further action as is required to effectuate the transfer contemplated hereby and shall indemnify each Collateral Agent
for loss or damage suffered by such Collateral Agent as a result of such transfer except for loss or damage suffered by such Collateral Agent as a result of the willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad faith or material breach of this Agreement by
such Collateral Agent or any affiliate, director, officer, employee, counsel, agent or attorney-in-fact of such Collateral Agent (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment). 
(b) Pending delivery or transfer of control of the Control Collateral to the Additional Collateral Agent as provided in
Section 2.09(a), the Controlling Collateral Agent agrees to hold or maintain control of any Shared Collateral constituting Control Collateral, from time to time in its possession, as gratuitous bailee for the benefit of each other First-Lien
Secured Party and any assignee, solely for the purpose of perfecting the security interest granted in such Control Collateral, if any, pursuant to the applicable First-Lien Security Documents, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Section 2.09.  (c) The duties or responsibilities of each Collateral Agent under this Section 2.09 shall be
limited solely to holding or maintaining control of any Shared Collateral constituting Control Collateral as gratuitous bailee for the benefit of each other First-Lien Secured Party for purposes of perfecting the Lien held by such First-Lien Secured
Parties thereon.  SECTION 2.10 Amendments to Security Documents. 
(a) Without the prior written consent of the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, each Additional First-Lien Secured Party agrees that no
Additional First-Lien Security Document may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified or entered into to the extent such amendment, supplement or modification, or the terms of any new Additional First-Lien Security Document would be prohibited
by, or would require any Grantor to act or refrain from acting in a manner that would violate, any of the terms of this Agreement or any Secured Credit Document.  (b) Without the prior written consent of the Additional Collateral Agent, the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent agrees that no Credit Agreement Collateral Document may be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified or entered into to the extent such amendment, supplement or modification, or the terms of any new Credit Agreement Collateral Document would be prohibited by, or would require any Grantor to act or refrain from acting in a manner
that would violate, any of the terms of this Agreement or any Secured Credit Document. 


(c) In making determinations required by this Section 2.10, each Collateral Agent may
conclusively rely on a certificate of an authorized officer of the Borrower stating that such amendment is permitted by Section 2.10(a) or (b), as the case may be.  ARTICLE III  Existence and Amounts of Liens and Obligations 
SECTION 3.01 Determinations with Respect to Amounts of Liens and Obligations. Whenever a Collateral Agent or any Authorized
Representative shall be required, in connection with the exercise of its rights or the performance of its obligations hereunder, to determine the existence or amount of any First-Lien Obligations of any Series, or the Shared Collateral subject to
any Lien securing the First-Lien Obligations of any Series, it may request that such information be furnished to it in writing by each other Authorized Representative or Collateral Agent and shall be entitled to make such determination or not make
any determination on the basis of the information so furnished; provided, however, that if an Authorized Representative or a Collateral Agent shall fail or refuse reasonably promptly to provide the requested information, the requesting
Collateral Agent or Authorized Representative shall be entitled to make any such determination by such method as it may, in the exercise of its good faith judgment, determine, including by reliance upon a certificate of the Borrower. Each Collateral
Agent and each Authorized Representative may rely conclusively, and shall be fully protected in so relying, on any determination made by it in accordance with the provisions of the preceding sentence (or as otherwise directed by a court of competent
jurisdiction) and shall have no liability to any Grantor, any First-Lien Secured Party or any other person as a result of such determination.  ARTICLE IV  The Controlling Collateral Agent 
SECTION 4.01 Authority. (a) [Reserved].  (b) In furtherance of the foregoing, each Non-Controlling Secured Party acknowledges and agrees that the Controlling Collateral Agent shall be entitled, for the benefit of the First-Lien Secured Parties,
to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of or deal with any Shared Collateral as provided herein and in the First-Lien Security Documents, as applicable, pursuant to which the Controlling Collateral Agent is the collateral agent for such Shared
Collateral, without regard to any rights to which the Non-Controlling Secured Parties would otherwise be entitled as a result of the First-Lien Obligations held by such Non-Controlling Secured Parties. Without limiting the foregoing, each
Non-Controlling Secured Party agrees that none of the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any other First-Lien Secured Party shall have any duty or obligation first to marshal or realize upon any type of Shared
Collateral (or any other Collateral securing any of the First-Lien Obligations), or to sell, dispose of or otherwise liquidate all or any portion of such Shared Collateral (or any other 



Collateral securing any First-Lien Obligations), in any manner that would maximize the return to the Non-Controlling Secured Parties, notwithstanding that the order and timing of any such
realization, sale, disposition or liquidation may affect the amount of proceeds actually received by the Non-Controlling Secured Parties from such realization, sale, disposition or liquidation. Except with respect to any actions expressly prohibited
or required to be taken by this Agreement, each of the First-Lien Secured Parties waives any claim it may now or hereafter have against any Collateral Agent or the Authorized Representative of any other Series of First-Lien Obligations or any other
First-Lien Secured Party of any other Series arising out of (i) any actions which any Collateral Agent, Authorized Representative or the First-Lien Secured Parties take or omit to take (including, actions with respect to the creation,
perfection or continuation of Liens on any Collateral, actions with respect to the foreclosure upon, sale, release or depreciation of, or failure to realize upon, any of the Collateral and actions with respect to the collection of any claim for all
or any part of the First-Lien Obligations from any account debtor, guarantor or any other party) in accordance with the First-Lien Security Documents or any other agreement related thereto or to the collection of the First-Lien Obligations or the
valuation, use, protection or release of any security for the First-Lien Obligations, (ii) any election by any Applicable Authorized Representative or any holders of First-Lien Obligations, in any proceeding instituted under the Bankruptcy
Code, of the application of Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or (iii) subject to Section 2.05, any borrowing by, or grant of a security interest or administrative expense priority under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or
any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law, by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, as debtor-in-possession. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Controlling Collateral Agent shall not accept any Shared Collateral
in full or partial satisfaction of any First-Lien Obligations pursuant to Section 9-620 of the Uniform Commercial Code of any jurisdiction, without the consent of each Authorized Representative representing holders of First-Lien Obligations for
whom such Collateral constitutes Shared Collateral.  SECTION 4.02 Rights as a First-Lien Secured Party. (a) The
Person serving as the Controlling Collateral Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a First-Lien Secured Party under any Series of First-Lien Obligations that it holds as any other First-Lien Secured Party of such
Series and may exercise the same as though it were not the Collateral Agent and the term First-Lien Secured Party or First-Lien Secured Parties or (as applicable) Credit Agreement Secured Party, Credit
Agreement Secured Parties, Additional First-Lien Secured Party, Additional First-Lien Secured Parties, Initial Additional First-Lien Secured Party or Initial Additional First-Lien Secured Parties
shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Controlling Collateral Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Controlling Collateral Agent
hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to any other First-Lien Secured Party. 


SECTION 4.03 Exculpatory Provisions. (a) The Controlling Collateral Agent shall
not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other First-Lien Security Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Controlling Collateral Agent: 
(i) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties of any kind or nature to any Person, regardless of
whether an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;  (ii) shall not have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other First-Lien Security Documents that the Controlling Collateral Agent is required to exercise as directed
in writing by the Applicable Authorized Representative; provided that the Controlling Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Collateral Agent to liability
or that is contrary to any First-Lien Security Document or applicable law;  (iii) shall not, except as
expressly set forth herein and in the other First-Lien Security Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or
obtained by the Person serving as the Controlling Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity; 
(iv) shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the
Applicable Authorized Representative or (ii) in the absence of the willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad faith or material breach of this Agreement by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any affiliate, director, officer, employee, counsel,
agent or attorney-in-fact of the Controlling Collateral Agent (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment) or (iii) in reliance on a certificate of an authorized officer of the Borrower stating that
such action is permitted by the terms of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that the Controlling Collateral Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Event of Default under any Series of First-Lien Obligations unless and until
notice describing such Event Default is given to the Controlling Collateral Agent by the Authorized Representative of such First-Lien Obligations or the Borrower); 
(v) shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other First-Lien Security Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith,
(iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this
Agreement, any other First-Lien Security Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the First-Lien Security Documents, (v) the value or the sufficiency
of any Collateral for any Series of First-Lien 



Obligations, or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in any Secured Credit Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Controlling
Collateral Agent; and  (vi) with respect to the Credit Agreement or any Additional First-Lien Document, may
conclusively assume that the Grantors have complied with all of their obligations thereunder unless advised in writing by the Authorized Representative thereunder to the contrary specifically setting forth the alleged violation. 
(b) Each First-Lien Secured Party acknowledges that, in addition to acting as the initial Controlling Collateral Agent, Goldman Sachs Bank
USA also serves as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent (under, and as defined in, the Credit Agreement), and each First-Lien Secured Party hereby waives any right to make any objection or claim against Goldman Sachs Bank USA (or any successor
Controlling Collateral Agent or any of their respective counsel) based on any alleged conflict of interest or breach of duties arising from the Controlling Collateral Agent also serving as the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. 
SECTION 4.04 Reliance by Controlling Collateral Agent. The Controlling Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall
not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Controlling Collateral Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and
shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Controlling Collateral Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may include, but shall not be limited to, counsel for the Borrower or counsel for the Applicable Authorized Representative),
independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
SECTION 4.05 Delegation of Duties. The Controlling Collateral Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights
and powers hereunder or under any other First-Lien Security Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Controlling Collateral Agent. The Controlling Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its
duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Affiliates. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Affiliates of the Controlling Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent.
 SECTION 4.06 Non Reliance on Controlling Collateral Agent and Other First-Lien Secured Parties. Each First-Lien
Secured Party acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Controlling Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative or any other First-Lien Secured Party or any of their Affiliates and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed 



appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Secured Credit Documents. Each First-Lien Secured Party also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Controlling Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative or any other First-Lien Secured Party or any of their Affiliates and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Secured Credit Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

each Grantor shall have executed and delivered a Joinder Agreement (with such changes as may be reasonably approved by the Controlling Collateral Agent and Additional Senior Class Debt Representative) pursuant to which such Additional Senior Class
Debt Representative becomes an Authorized Representative hereunder, and the Additional Senior Class Debt in respect of which such Additional Senior Class Debt Representative is the Authorized Representative constitutes Additional First-Lien
Obligations and the related Additional Senior Class Debt Parties become subject hereto and bound hereby as Additional First-Lien Secured Parties;  (ii) the Borrower shall have (x) delivered to each Collateral Agent true and complete copies of each of the Additional First-Lien Documents relating to such Additional Senior Class Debt, certified as
being true and correct by an authorized officer of the Borrower and (y) identified in a certificate of an authorized officer the obligations to be designated as Additional First-Lien Obligations and the initial aggregate principal amount or
face amount thereof and certified that such obligations are permitted to be incurred and secured on a pari passu basis with the then existing First-Lien Obligations and by the terms of the then existing Secured Credit Documents; 
(iii) all filings, recordations and/or amendments or supplements to the First-Lien Security Documents necessary or
desirable in the reasonable judgment of the Additional Collateral Agent to confirm and perfect the Liens securing the relevant obligations relating to such Additional Senior Class Debt shall have been made, executed and/or delivered (or, with
respect to any such filings or recordations, acceptable provisions to perform such filings or recordations shall have been taken in the reasonable judgment of the Additional Collateral Agent), and all fees and taxes in connection therewith shall
have been paid (or acceptable provisions to make such payments have been taken in the reasonable judgment of the Additional Collateral Agent); and  (iv) the Additional First-Lien Documents, as applicable, relating to such Additional Senior Class Debt shall provide, in a manner reasonably satisfactory to each Collateral Agent, that each Additional
Senior Class Debt Party with respect to such Additional Senior Class Debt will be subject to and bound by the provisions of this Agreement in its capacity as a holder of such Additional Senior Class Debt. 


Each Authorized Representative acknowledges and agrees that upon execution and delivery of a
Joinder Agreement substantially in the form of Annex II by an Additional Senior Class Debt Representative and each Grantor in accordance with this Section 5.13, the Additional Collateral Agent will continue to act in its capacity as Additional
Collateral Agent in respect of the then existing Authorized Representatives (other than the Administrative Agent) and such additional Authorized Representative.  SECTION 5.14 Agent Capacities. Except as expressly provided herein or in the Credit Agreement Collateral Documents, Goldman Sachs Bank USA is acting in the capacities of Administrative Agent and
Credit Agreement Collateral Agent solely for the Credit Agreement Secured Parties. Except as expressly provided herein or in the Additional First-Lien Security Documents,

as expressly set forth herein, none of the Administrative Agent, the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or the Additional Collateral Agent shall have any duties or obligations in respect of any of the Collateral, all of such duties and obligations,
if any, being subject to and governed by the applicable Secured Credit Documents.  SECTION 5.15 Integration. This
Agreement together with the other Secured Credit Documents and the First-Lien Security Documents represents the agreement of each of the Grantors and the First-Lien Secured Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and there are no promises,
undertakings, representations or warranties by any Grantor, the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, or any other First-Lien Secured Party relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Secured
Credit Documents.  SECTION 5.16 Additional Grantors. The Borrower agrees that, if any Subsidiary shall become a Grantor
after the date hereof, it will promptly cause such Subsidiary to become party hereto by executing and delivering an instrument in the form of Annex III. Any successor or assign of Holdings shall execute and deliver an instrument substantially
in the form of Annex III. Upon such execution and delivery, such Subsidiary or successor or assign of Holdings will become a Grantor hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Grantor herein. The execution and
delivery of such instrument shall not require the consent of any other party hereunder, and will be acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, the Initial Additional Authorized Representative and each additional Authorized Representative. The rights
and obligations of each Grantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Grantor as a party to this Agreement. 


SECTION 5.17 Administrative Agent and Representative. It is understood and agreed
that (a) the Administrative Agent is entering into this Agreement in its capacity as administrative agent and collateral agent under the Credit Agreement and the provisions of Article IX of the Credit Agreement applicable to the Agents (as

purposes of Section 5.01(a), including any 

nd Priority Debt Parties to be applied pursuant to Section 4.01 and (iii) third, if no Second Priority Debt Obligations are outstanding, to the owner of the subject
property, such other Person as may be entitled thereto or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. If any Representative or any Secured Party shall, at any time, receive any proceeds of any such insurance policy or any such award
in contravention of this Agreement, it shall pay such proceeds over to the Designated Senior Representative or Designated Second Priority Representative in accordance with the terms of Section 4.02. 
Section 5.03. Amendments to Second Priority Collateral Documents. 
(a) No Second Priority Collateral Document may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified or entered into to the extent such
amendment, supplement or modification, or the terms of any new Second Priority Collateral Document, would be prohibited by any of the terms of this Agreement or any Senior Debt Document. The Borrower agrees to deliver to the Designated Senior
Representative copies of (i) any amendments, supplements or other modifications to the Second Priority Collateral Documents and (ii) any new Second Priority Collateral Documents promptly after effectiveness thereof. Each Second Priority
Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, agrees that each Second Priority Collateral Document under its Second Priority Debt Facility shall include the following language
(or language to similar effect reasonably approved by the Designated Senior Representative): 
  -18-



Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the liens and security
interests granted to the [Second Priority Representative] pursuant to this Agreement are expressly subject and subordinate to the liens and security interests granted in favor of the Senior Secured Parties (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement
referred to below), including liens and security interests granted to Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent, pursuant to or in connection with the Credit Agreement, dated as of January 30, 2013 among Holdings, the Borrower, the
lenders from time to time party thereto, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent and the other parties thereto, as further amended, restated, extended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time and (ii) the exercise of any
right or remedy by the [Second Priority Representative] hereunder is subject to the limitations and provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement dated as of
[                ], 20[    ] (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Intercreditor
Agreement), among Bright Horizons Capital Corp., Bright Horizons Family Solutions LLC, the other Grantors (as defined therein) from time to time party thereto, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as Administrative Agent, and
[                                         
   ]. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall govern. 
(b) In the event that each applicable Senior Representative and/or the Senior Secured Parties enter into any amendment, waiver or consent
in respect of any of the Senior Collateral Documents for the purpose of adding to or deleting from, or waiving or consenting to any departures from any provisions of, any Senior Collateral Document or changing in any manner the rights of the Senior
Representatives, the Senior Secured Parties, the Borrower or any other Grantor thereunder (including the release of any Liens in Senior Collateral) in a manner that is applicable to all Senior Facilities, then such amendment, waiver or consent shall
apply automatically to any comparable provision of each comparable Second Priority Collateral Document without the consent of any Second Priority Representative or any Second Priority Debt Party and without any action by any Second Priority
Representative, the Borrower or any other Grantor; provided, however, that written notice of such amendment, waiver or consent shall have been given to each Second Priority Representative within 10 Business Days after the effectiveness
of such amendment, waiver or consent.  Section 5.04. Rights as Unsecured Creditors. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Second Priority Representatives and the Second Priority Debt Parties may exercise rights and remedies as unsecured creditors against the Borrower and any other Grantor in accordance with the terms of the Second
Priority Debt Documents and applicable law so long as such rights and remedies do not violate (or are not otherwise prohibited by) any express provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the receipt by any Second Priority
Representative or any Second Priority Debt Party of the required payments of principal, premium, interest, fees and other amounts due under the Second Priority Debt Documents so long as such receipt is not the direct or indirect result of the
exercise by a Second Priority Representative or any Second Priority Debt Party of rights or remedies as a secured creditor in respect of Shared Collateral. In the event any Second Priority Representative or any Second Priority Debt Party becomes a
judgment lien creditor in respect of Shared Collateral as a result of its enforcement of its rights as an unsecured creditor in respect of Second Priority Debt Obligations, such judgment lien sha

ated Senior
Representative or any of its agents or bailees, including the transfer of possession and control, as applicable, of the Pledged or Controlled Collateral, together with any necessary endorsements and notices to depositary banks, securities
intermediaries and commodities intermediaries, and assign its rights under 
  -20-




any landlord waiver or bailees letter or any similar agreement or arrangement granting it rights or access to Shared Collateral, or (B) direct and deliver such Shared Collateral as a
court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct, (ii) notify any applicable insurance carrier that it is no longer entitled to be a loss payee or additional insured under the insurance policies of any Grantor issued by such insurance
carrier and (iii) notify any governmental authority involved in any condemnation or similar proceeding involving any Grantor that the Designated Second Party Representative is entitled to approve any awards granted in such proceeding. The
Borrower shall take such further action as is required to effectuate the transfer contemplated hereby and shall indemnify the Designated Senior Representative for loss or damage suffered by the Designated Senior Representative as a result of such
transfer, except for loss or damage suffered by such Person as a result of the willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad faith or material breach of this Agreement by such Person or any affiliate, director, officer, employee, counsel, agent or
attorney-in-fact of such Person (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment).  (g)
None of the Senior Representatives nor any of the other Senior Secured Parties shall be required to marshal any present or future collateral security for any obligations of the Borrower or any other Grantor to any Senior Representative or any Senior
Secured Party under the Senior Debt Documents or any assurance of payment in respect thereof, or to resort to such collateral security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of their rights in respect of such collateral
security or any assurance of payment in respect thereof shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights, however existing or arising.  Section 5.06. When Discharge of Senior Obligations Deemed To Not Have Occurred. If, at any time concurrently with or after the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, the Borrower or any
Grantor enters into any Refinancing of any Senior Obligations, then such Discharge of Senior Obligations shall automatically be deemed not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement (other than with respect to any actions taken prior to the
date of such designation as a result of the occurrence of such first Discharge of Senior Obligations) and the applicable agreement governing such Senior Obligations shall automatically be treated as a Senior Debt Document for all purposes of this
Agreement, including for purposes of the Lien priorities and rights in respect of Shared Collateral set forth herein and the agent, representative or trustee for the holders of such Senior Obligations shall be the Senior Representative for all
purposes of this Agreement. Upon receipt of notice of such incurrence (including the identity of the new Senior Representative), each Second Priority Representative (including the Designated Second Priority Representative) shall promptly
(a) enter into such documents and agreements (at the expense of the Borrower), including amendments or supplements to this Agreement, as the Borrower or such new Senior Representative shall reasonably request in writing in order to provide the
new Senior Representative the rights of a Senior Representative contemplated hereby, (b) deliver to such Senior Representative, to the extent that it is legally permitted to do so, all Shared Collateral, including all proceeds thereof, held or
controlled by such Second Priority Representative or any of its agents or bailees, including the transfer of possession and control, as applicable, of the Pledged or Controlled Collateral, together with any necessary endorsements and notices to
depositary banks, securities intermediaries and commodities intermediaries, and assign its rights under any landlord waiver or bailees letter or any similar agreement or arrangement granting it rights or access to Shared Collateral,
(c) notify any applicable insurance carrier that it is no longer entitled to be a loss payee or additional insured under the insurance policies of any Grantor issued by such insuranc

 further Enforcement Actions; provided that the Purchase (as defined below) shall have been consummated
on the Business Day specified in the Purchase Notice in accordance with Section 5.07(b).  (b) On the date specified by
the Designated Second Priority Representative in the Purchase Notice (which shall be a Business Day not less than five (5) Business Days, nor more than ten (10) Business Days, after receipt by the Senior Representatives of the Purchase
Notice), the Senior Secured Parties shall, subject to any required approval of any court or other governmental authority then in effect, sell to the Second Priority Debt Parties electing to purchase pursuant to Section 5.07(a) (the
Purchasing Parties), and the Purchasing Parties shall purchase (the Purchase) from the Senior Secured Parties, all of the Senior Obligations; provided that the Senior Obligations purchased shall not
include any rights of Senior Secured Parties with respect to indemnification and other obligations of the Borrower and the Grantors under the Senior Debt Documents that are expressly stated to survive the termination of the Senior Debt Documents
(the Surviving Obligations).  (c) Without limiting the obligations of the Borrower and the Grantors under
the Senior Debt Documents to the Senior Secured Parties with respect to the Surviving Obligations (which shall not be transferred in connection with the Purchase), on the date of the Purchase, the Purchasing Parties shall (i) pay to the Senior
Secured Parties as the purchase price (the Purchase Price) therefor the full amount of all Senior Obligations then outstanding and unpaid (including principal, premium, interest, fees, breakage costs, attorneys fees and
expenses, and, in the case of any obligations in respect of Secured Hedge Agreements owed to a Senior Secured Party, the amount that would be payable by the relevant Loan Party thereunder if it were to terminate such Secured Hedge Agreements on the
date of the Purchase or, if not terminated, an amount determined by the relevant Senior Secured Party to be necessary to collateralize its credit risk arising out of such Secured Hedge Agreement), (ii) furnish cash collateral (the Cash
Collateral) to the Sen

 Secured Party) at the time of the Purchase which could reasonably be expected to result in any loss, cost, damage or expense to any of the Senior Secured Parties; provided that in no event shall any Purchasing
Party be liable to reimburse the Senior Secured Parties in respect of indemnification obligations in excess of proceeds of Collateral received by the Purchasing Parties.  (d) The Purchase Price and Cash Collateral shall be remitted by wire transfer in immediately available funds to such account of the respective Senior Representative as it shall designate to the Purchasing
Parties. Each Senior Representative shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, distribute the amounts received by it in respect of the Purchase Price to the Senior Secured Parties in accordance with the Senior Debt Documents. Interest shall be
calculated to but excluding the day on which the Purchase occurs if the amounts so paid by the Purchasing Parties to the account designated by the Senior Collateral Agent are received in such account prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, and
interest shall be calculated to and including such day if the amounts so paid by the Purchasing Parties to the account designated by the respective Senior Representative are received in such account later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time.
 (e) The Purchase shall be made without representation or warranty of any kind by the Senior Secured Parties as to the Senior
Obligations, the Senior Collateral or otherwise and without recourse to the Senior Secured Parties, except that the Senior Secured Parties shall represent and warrant (i) the amount of the Senior Obligations being purchased, (ii) that the
Senior Secured Parties own the Senior Obligations free and clear of any liens or encumbrances and (iii) that the Senior Secured Parties have the right to assign the Senior Obligations and the assignment is duly authorized. 
ARTICLE VI 
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings.  Section 6.01. Financing Issues. Until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, if the Borrower or any other Grantor shall be subject to any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding and
any Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Party shall desire to consent (or not object) to the sale, use or lease of cash or other collateral or to consent (or not object) to the Borrowers or any other Grantors obtaining financing
under Section 363 or Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law (DIP Financing), then each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority
Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, agrees that it will raise no (a) objection to and will not otherwise contest or oppose (or join with or support any other party opposing, objecting to or contesting) such sale, use or lease of
such cash or other collateral or such DIP Financing and, except to the extent permitted by the proviso in clause (ii) of Section 3.01(a) and Section 6.03, will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection
therewith and, to the extent the Liens securing any Senior Obligations are subordinated or pari passu with such DIP Financing, will subordinate (and will be deemed hereunder to have subordinated) its Liens in the Shared Collateral to
(x) such DIP Financing (and al

er this Agreement and (iii) in the event any Second Priority Representatives, for themselves and on behalf of the Second Priority Debt Parties under their Second Priority Debt Facilities, seek or request
adequate protection and such adequate protection is granted (in each instance, to the extent such grant is otherwise permissible under the terms and conditions of this Agreement) in the form of a superpriority claim, then such Second Priority
Representatives, for themselves and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under their Second Priority Debt Facilities, agree that each Senior Representative shall also be granted adequate protection in the form of a superpriority claim, which
superpriority claim shall be senior to the superpriority claim of the Second Priority Debt Parties.  Section 6.04.
Preference Issues. If any Senior Secured Party is required in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or otherwise to disgorge, turn over or otherwise pay any amount to the estate of the Borrower or any other Grantor (or any trustee,
receiver or similar Person therefor), because the payment of such amount was declared to be fraudulent or preferential in any respect or for any other reason, (any such amount, a Recovery), whether received as proceeds of security,
enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise, then the Senior Obligations shall be reinstated to the extent of such Recovery and deemed to be outstanding as if such payment had not occurred and the Senior Secured Parties shall be entitled to the
benefits of this Agreement until a Discharge of Senior Obligations with respect to all such recovered amounts. If this Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery, this Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such
prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties hereto. Each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under i

y the
number of Senior Secured Debt Parties required under Section 1126(d) of the Bankruptcy Code. 
Section 6.11. Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. [Each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of
each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, shall not object to, oppose, support any objection, or take any other action to impede, the right of any Senior Secured Party to make an election under Section 1111(b)(2)
of the Bankruptcy Code. Each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, waives any claim it may hereafter have against any senior claimholder arising out of
the election by any Senior Secured Party of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.]  ARTICLE VII+
 Reliance; Etc.  Section 7.01. Reliance. All loans and other extensions of credit made or deemed made on and after the date hereof by the Senior Secured Parties to the Borrower or any Grantor shall be deemed
to have been given and made in reliance upon this Agreement. Each Second Priority Representative, on behalf of itself and each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, acknowledges that it and such Second Priority Debt
Parties have, independently and without reliance on any Senior Representative or other Senior Secured Party, and based on documents and information deemed by them appropriate, made their own credit analysis and decision to enter into the Second
Priority Debt Documents to which they are party or by which they are bound, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and they will continue to make their own credit decisions in taking or not taking any action under the
Second Priority Debt Documents or this Agreement.

on behalf of itself and each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Fa

Senior Secured Parties will be entitled to manage and supervise their respective loans and extensions of credit under the Senior Debt Documents in accordance with law and as they may otherwise, in their sole discretion, deem appropriate, and the
Senior Secured Parties may manage their loans and extensions of credit without regard to any rights or interests that the Second Priority Representatives and the Second Priority Debt Parties have in the Shared Collateral or otherwise, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement. Neither any Senior Representative nor any other Senior Secured Party shall have any duty to any Second Priority Representative or Second Priority Debt Party to act or refrain from acting in a manner that allows,
or results in, the occurrence or continuance of an event of default or default under any agreement with the Borrower or any Subsidiary (including the Second Priority Debt Documents), regardless of any knowledge thereof that they may have or be
charged with. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Senior Representatives, the Senior Secured Parties, the Second Priority Representatives and the Second Priority Debt Parties have not otherwise made to each other, nor do they hereby
make to each other, any warranties, express or implied, nor do they assume any liability to each other with respect to (a) the enforceability, validity, value or collectability of any of the Senior Obligations, the Second Priority Debt
Obligations or any guarantee or security which may have been granted to any of them in connection therewith, (b) any Grantors title to or right to transfer any of the Shared Collateral or (c) any other matter except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement.  Section 7.03. Obligations Unconditional. All rights, interests, agreements and
obligations of the Senior Representatives, the Senior Secured Par

Parties hereunder shall remain in full force and effect irrespective of: 
(a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Senior Debt Document or any Second Priority Debt Document;

or Second Priority Debt Obligations, or any amendment or waiver or other modification, including any increase in the amount thereof, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, of the terms of the Credit Agreement or any other Senior Debt Document or
of the terms of any Second Priority Debt Document;  (c) any exchange of any security interest in any Shared
Collateral or any other collateral or any amendment, waiver or other modification, whether in writing or by course of conduct or otherwise, of all or any of the Senior Obligations or Second Priority Debt Obligations or any guarantee thereof;

(d) the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding in respect
of the Borrower or any other Grantor; or  (e) any other circumstances that otherwise might constitute a defense
available to (i) the Borrower or any other Grantor in respect of the Senior Obligations (other than the Discharge of Senior Obligations subject to Sections 5.06 and 6.04) or (ii) any Second Priority Representative or Second Priority Debt
Party in respect of this Agreement.  ARTICLE VIII  Miscellaneous  Section 8.01. Conflicts. Subject to
Section 8.21, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of any Senior Debt Document or any Second Priority Debt Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the relative rights and obligations of the Senior Secured Collateral Agent, the Senior Representatives and the Senior Secured Parties (as amongst themselves) with respect to any Senior Collateral shall be governed by the terms of the
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and in the event of any conflict between the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement, the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall control. 
Section 8.02. Continuing Nature of this Agreement; Severability. Subject to Section 6.04, this Agreement shall continue

or any Second Priority Debt Party, to extend credit and other financial accommodations and lend monies to or for the benefit of the Borrower or any Grantor constituting Senior Obligations in reliance hereon. The terms of this Agreement shall survive
and continue in full force and effect in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall not be affected or impaired thereby. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 
Section 8.03. Amendments; Waivers.  (a) No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power,
or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the par

to are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
Section 8.03(b), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on any party hereto in any case shall entitle such party to any other or further notice
or demand in similar or other circumstances.

(other than pursuant to any Joinder Agreement), except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by each Representative (in each case, acting in accordance with the documents governing the applicable Debt Facility) (and with
respect to any such waiver, amendment or modification which by the terms of this Agreement requires the Borrowers consent or which directly and adversely affects the rights, interests, liabilities or privileges of, or impose additional duties
and obligations on, the Borrower or any other Grantor, with the consent of the Borrower). Any such amendment, supplement or waiver shall be in writing and shall be binding upon the Senior Secured Parties and the Second Priority Debt Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Secured Party, any
Representative may become a party hereto by execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement in accordance with Section 8.09 and upon such execution and delivery, such Representative and the Secured Parties and Senior Obligations or Second
Priority Debt Obligations of the Debt Facility for which such Representative is acting shall be subject to the terms hereof. 
Section 8.04. Information Concerning Financial Condition of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries. The Senior Representatives,

Representatives, the Senior Secured Parties, the Second Priority Representatives and the Second Priority Secured Parties shall have no duty to advise any other party hereunder of information known to it or them regarding such condition or any such
circumstances or otherwise. In the event that any Senior Representative, any Senior Secured Party, any Second Priority Representative or any Second Priority Debt Party, in its sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide

Senior Obligations or any part thereof and to any other indulgence with respect thereto, to any substitution, exchange or release of any security that may at any time secure any part of the Senior Obligations and to the addition or release of any

shall become a Grantor after the date hereof, it will promptly cause such Subsidiary to become party hereto by executing and delivering an instrument in the form of Annex II. Upon such execution and delivery, such Subsidiary will become
a Grantor hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Grantor herein. The execution and delivery of such instrument shall not require the consent of any other party hereunder, and will be acknowledged by the Designated
Second Priority Representative and the Designated Senior Representative. The rights and obligations of each Grantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Grantor as a party to this Agreement.
 Section 8.08. Dealings with Grantors. Upon any application or demand by the Borrower or any Grantor to any
Representative to take or permit any action under any of the provisions of this Agreement or under any Collateral Document (if such action is subject to the provisions hereof), at the request of such Representative, the Borrower or such Grantor, as
appropriate, shall furnish to such Representative a certificate of an authorized officer (an Officers Certificate) stating that all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Agreement or such Collateral Document, as
the case may be, relating to the proposed action have been complied with, except that in the case of any such application or demand as to which the furnishing of such documents is specifically required by any provision of this Agreement or any
Collateral Document relating to such particular application or demand, no additional certificate or opinion need be furnished.
