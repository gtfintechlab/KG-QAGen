Measurement Period, the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall have consummated the Cayan Acquisition or other purchase, acquisition (including through a merger or consolidation) or Investment, or Disposition, in each case, all of (or, in the case of an

original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP (subject to the approval of the Required Lenders); provided that, until so amended, regardless of whether any such request by the Borrower or the Required Lenders is made before or after
such change to GAAP, (i) such ratio or requirement shall continue to be computed in accordance with GAAP prior to such change therein and (ii) the Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders financial statements and

Performance. Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to times of day shall be references to Eastern time (daylight or standard, as applicable). When the payment of any obligation or the performance of any covenant, duty or obligation
is stated to be due or performance required on a day which is not a Business Day, the date of such payment (other than as described in the definition of Interest Period) or performance shall extend to the immediately succeeding Business
Day, and in the case of any payment accruing interest or fees, such interest or fees shall be payable for the period of such extension.

ARTICLE II. 
THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS 
2.01 Term Loan Borrowing. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make a single loan to
the Borrower in Dollars on the Closing Date in an amount not to exceed such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the Term Loan Commitment. The Borrowing shall consist of Term Loans made simultaneously by the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Applicable Percentage of the Term Loan Facility. Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01 and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. Term Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate
Loans, as further provided herein.  2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans. 
(a) Each Borrowing, each conversion of Term Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans
shall be made upon the Borrowers irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by (A) telephone, or (B) delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Committed Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be
confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Committed Loan Notice. Each such Committed Loan Notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than (i) in the case of any Borrowing of, conversion to or
continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans, 11:00 a.m. three Business Days prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation and (ii) in the case of any
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, 1:00 p.m. on the requested date of such Borrowing; provided, however, that if the Borrower wishes to request Eurodollar Rate Loans having an Interest Period other than one, two, three or six months in
duration as provided in the definition of Interest Period, the applicable notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. four Business Days prior to the requested date of such Borrowing,
conversion or continuation, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Lenders of such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is acceptable to all of them. Not later than 11:00 a.m. three Business Days
before the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower (which notice may be by telephone) whether or not the requested Interest Period has been consented to by all the Lenders.
Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal
amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Committed Loan Notice shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Term Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of
Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Term Loans are to be converted and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or if the
Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Term Loans shall be made as, or converted to Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day
of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an
Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.  (b) Following receipt of a Committed
Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Term Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base 
  23 



Rate Loans described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at
the Administrative Agents Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice (or in the case of a Committed Loan Notice for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans on same day notice, prior to 3:00
p.m. on the Business Day specified in such Committed Loan Notice). Upon satisfaction of any conditions expressly applicable to such Borrowing set forth in Article IV of this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so
received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds,
in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower. 
(c) The Borrower may elect to convert a Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing as a
Borrowing of the same Type and, in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Loan, may elect the Interest Period therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in
which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the relevant Lenders holding the Loans constituting such Borrowing, and the Loans constituting each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. Except as otherwise provided
herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the
Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as such Event of Default is continuing (A) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Rate Borrowing and
(B) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Rate Borrowing shall be converted to a Base Rate Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period therefor; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the exercise of the
rights and remedies provided for in Section 8.02 upon the occurrence of an Event of Default. 
(d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest
Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. At any time that any Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in Bank of Americas prime rate
used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.  (e) After giving effect to
all Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans from one Type to the other and all continuations of Term Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in effect with respect to the Term Loan Facility. 
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Lender may exchange, continue or rollover all of the
portion of its Loans in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
and such Lender.  2.03 [Reserved]. 
2.04 [Reserved].  2.05
[Reserved].

2.06 Prepayments. 
(a) The Borrower may, upon delivery of a Notice of Loan Prepayment to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to
time voluntarily prepay the Term Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than (A) in the case of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans,
11:00 a.m. three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment and (B) 11:00 a.m. on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then
outstanding. Each such Notice of Loan Prepayment shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative
Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the
payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein; provided that a Notice of Loan Prepayment may state that such prepayment is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or other
events, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by
all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. The Borrower may in its sole discretion select the Borrowing (and the order of
maturity of principal payments) to be prepaid under this Section 2.06 (absent an express direction from the Borrower, such prepayment shall be applied in the direct order of maturity); and each such
prepayment of the outstanding Loans shall be paid to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages. 
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Cayan Acquisition has not been consummated in all
material respects in accordance with the Cayan Purchase Agreement on or before the date that is two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, the Borrower shall repay to the Lenders the Outstanding Amount of the Term Loans on such date. 
2.07 Termination of Commitments. The Term Loan Commitments shall be reduced to zero immediately after the funding thereof on the
Closing Date, except with respect to a Defaulting Lender, if any (to the extent of any applicable unfunded amount).  2.08
[Reserved].  2.09 Amortization of Term Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders the aggregate principal amount of the
Term Loans outstanding on the following dates in the respective amounts set forth opposite such dates (which amounts shall be reduced as a result of the application of prepayments in accordance with the order of priority set forth in
Section 2.06(a)):

 provided, however, that the Outstanding Amount of the Term Loans as of the Maturity Date shall be paid in full

2.10 Interest. 
(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, 
(i) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a
rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate;  (ii) each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; 
(b) (i) During the continuance of an Event of Default, if any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, any overdue amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Laws.  (ii) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and
payable upon demand.  (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date
applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any
Debtor Relief Law.  2.11 Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and at
the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees hereunder shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 
2.12 Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including when the Base Rate is determined by
reference to the Eurodollar Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a
360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall
accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is
made shall, subject to Section 2.14(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.  2.13 Evidence of Debt. The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records
maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of the Loans made by the
Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the
Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records

  26 



of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such
Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Term Note, which shall evidence such Lenders Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Term Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable),
amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.  2.14 Payments Generally; Administrative Agents
Clawback.  (a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without
condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff (except as otherwise provided in Section 3.01 with respect to Taxes). Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agents Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later
than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such
Lenders Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by
the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. 
(b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in
the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to
the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation,
plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.
If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such
period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any
claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
  27 


(ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative
Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then
each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, such
amount with interest thereon at a rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount. Any such repayment by any Lender shall be without prejudice to any claim such Lender may have against the Borrower
with respect to the amount of such payment and interest thereon.  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with
respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  (c)
Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not
made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the Term Loan set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly return
such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.  (d) Obligations of Lenders
Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund
any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c). 
(e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any
particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
2.15 Sharing of P

an Facility due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of the Term Loan Facility due and payable to all Lenders
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the Lenders at such time or (b) Obligations in respect of Term Loan Facility owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to such Lenders Applicable Percentage in respect of the Term Loan Facility owing (but not due and

payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payment on account of the Obligations in respect of the Term Loan Facility owing (but not due and payable) to
all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of the Lenders at such time then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase
(for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount
of Obligations in respect of the Term Loan Facility then due and payable to the Lenders or owing (but not due and payable ) to the Lenders, as the case may be, provided that: 
(i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf
of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.  2.16 [Reserved]. 
2.17 [Reserved].  2.18
[Reserved].  2.19 Defaulting Lenders. 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then,
the Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to
Section 10.1); provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the vote of any Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or modification expressly requiring the consent of all Lenders
or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender adversely and disproportionately when compared to the other affected Lenders; provided further that, in the event that the Administrative Agent and the Borrower each agree in
writing that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then such Lender shall cease to be a Defaulting Lender.

ARTICLE III. 
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 
3.01 Taxes. 
(a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under
any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent)
requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including
such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the Administrative Agent or a Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.  (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without
limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law or, at the option of the Administrative Agent, timely
reimburse it for the payment of, any such Other Taxes.  (c) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall
indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and any penalties, interest and reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the nature and amount of
such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall, and
does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as
required pursuant to Section 3.01(e) below.  (d) Evidence of
Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority
evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(e) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify, within 10 days after demand therefor,
(i) the Administrative Agent for any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of
the Borrower to do so), (ii) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower for any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.06(d) relating to the
maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower for any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan
Document, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate

  30 



setting forth in reasonable detail the nature and amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender
hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due
to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).  (f) Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that
is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by
applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without
withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding
two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.01(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be
required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
(A) any Lender that is not a Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of
copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) executed originals of
IRS Form W9 (or any successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;  (B)
any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender
becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable; 
(i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party
(x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as
applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W8-BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the
business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; 
  31 


(ii) executed originals of IRS Form
W-8ECI;  (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the
exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a
bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign
corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable;  (iv) to the extent a
Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by an underlying IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form
W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit
E-2 or Exhibit E-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as
applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be
prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if
such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code)
and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has
complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after
the date of this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 3.01, the term applicable law shall include FATCA. 
  32 


Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes
obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
(g) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any
obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender
determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such
refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any
interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower pursuant to this
subsection (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the Administrative Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would
place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such Tax had
never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other
Person.  (h) Each partys obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the
Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations under the Loan Documents. 
3.02 Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted
that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any Borrowing, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the
Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make, fund or charge interest with respect to any such Borrowing or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base
Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the
Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the 
  33 



circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent),
prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without
reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not
lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of
such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine
or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 
3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation
thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or
(ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan (in each case
with respect to clause (a)(i) above, Impacted Loans), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders reasonably determine that for any reason, the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect
to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the
Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of any such determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to
the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar
Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this
section, the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Required Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the
Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders notify the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any
Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge
interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof. 
  34 


3.04 Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans. 
(a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Rate); 
(ii) subject the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any
Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes, Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded
Taxes and Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 
(iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting
this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make
any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender accompanied by a certificate described in the immediately
following clause (d), the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as are reasonably necessary to compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
(b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any
Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements (whether or not having the force of law) has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders
capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Term Loan Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lenders
holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time the
Borrower will pay to such Lender upon the request of such Lender accompanied by a certificate described in the immediately following clause (d) such additional amount or amounts as are reasonably necessary to compensate such
Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.  (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (i) all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or by United States or foreign
regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith or
in implementation thereof, shall in each case be deemed to be a Change in Law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented. 
  35 


(d) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting
forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts reasonably necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the
Borrower shall be prima facie evidence of such amounts. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
(e) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such
Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine- month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof).  (f) Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender,
(i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as Eurocurrency liabilities), additional interest on
the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), and (ii) as long as
such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Term Loan Commitments or the funding of the
Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Term Loan Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such
Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have received at least ten (10) days prior
notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice ten (10) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and
payable ten (10) days from receipt of such notice.  3.05 Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last
day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); 
(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue
or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or  (c) any
assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13; excluding any loss of
anticipated profits but including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall
also pay any customary administrative fees reasonably charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. 
  36 


For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this
Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank
eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded. If requested by the Borrower, any Lender demanding payment under this Section shall deliver to the Borrower a
calculation of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount believed by the Lender to be payable under this Section.  3.06
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. Each Lender
may make any Loan to the Borrower through any Lending Office, provided that the exercise of this option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If any Lender requests
compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending
Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or
reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to
Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby
agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
(b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 3.01, or any Lender gives notice under Section 3.02, and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending
office in accordance with Section 3.06(a), or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, in each case, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with
Section 10.13.  3.07 Successor LIBOR. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or any other Loan Documents (including Section 10.01 hereof), if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or
Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that: 
(a) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for any requested Interest Period because the LIBOR
Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or  (b)
the administrator of the LIBOR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR or the LIBOR Screen Rate shall no longer be made
available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans (such specific date, the Scheduled Unavailability Date), or 
  37 


(c) syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include language similar
to that contained in this Section, are being executed or amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace LIBOR, 
then, reasonably promptly after such determination by the Administrative Agent or receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, as applicable, the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate (including any mathematical or other adjustments to the benchmark (if any) incorporated therein), giving due consideration to any
evolving or then existing convention for similar Dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such alternative benchmarks (any such proposed rate, a LIBOR Successor Rate), together with any proposed LIBOR Successor
Rate Conforming Changes (as defined below) and any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower
unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders do not accept such amendment. 
If no LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under clause (a) above exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date
has occurred (as applicable), the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, (to the extent of the
affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) the Eurodollar Rate component shall no longer be utilized in determining the Base Rate. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of,
conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans
(subject to the foregoing clause (y)) in the amount specified therein.  Notwithstanding anything else herein, any definition of LIBOR
Successor Rate shall provide that in no event shall such LIBOR Successor Rate be less than zero for purposes of this Agreement.  3.08
Survival. All of the Borrowers obligations under this Article III shall survive repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and resignation of the Administrative Agent. 
ARTICLE IV.  CONDITIONS
PRECEDENT TO TERM LOAN  4.01 Conditions of Term Loan. The effectiveness of this Agreement and the obligation of each Lender to
make its Term Loans on the Closing Date is subject to satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with Section 10.1) of the following conditions precedent. 
(a) The Administrative Agents receipt of the following, each of which shall be originals, telecopies or PDF

ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT  9.01
Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such
actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for
the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other
Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used
as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.  9.02
Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and
the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such
Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other
Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 
9.03 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein
and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: 
(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is
continuing; 
  57 


(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any
discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may
expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt, any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a
forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and  (c)
shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated
to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall
not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith
shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender. 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any
other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to
the Administrative Agent.  9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and
shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it
to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and
shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such
condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for
the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

9.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties
and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of
the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the
extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such
sub-agents.  9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent. 
(a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of
any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) so long as no payment or bankruptcy Event of Default exists, to appoint a successor, which shall
be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days
after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but
shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) so long as no payment or bankruptcy Event of Default exists, meeting the
qualifications set forth above; provided that in no event shall any such successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender; provided, further, that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that
no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. 
(b) If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the
definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) so long as no payment or bankruptcy Event of Default exists, appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier
day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Removal Effective Date), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. 
(c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or
removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent,
all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as
provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or
retired or removed) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 3.01(h) and other than any rights indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent as
of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective 
  59 



Date, as applicable, and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already
discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.
After the retiring or removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect
for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them (i) while the
retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent and (ii) after such resignation or removal for as long as any of them continues to act in any capacity hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, including (in
respect of any actions taken in connection with transferring the agency to any successor Administrative Agent).  9.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.  9.08 No Other Duties,
Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, neither the bookrunner nor Arranger listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in
its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.  9.09 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of
Claim. In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as
herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise 
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and
all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.11 and 10.04) allowed in
such judicial proceeding; and  (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such
claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative
Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.11 and 10.04. 
  60 


Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or
consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of
any Lender in any such proceeding.  9.10 ERISA Matters.

KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE
BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) have any liability to the Borrower,
any Lender or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agents transmission of Borrower Materials or
notices through the Platform, any other electronic platform or electronic messaging service, or through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any
other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages). 
(d) Change of Address, Etc. Each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may change its address, telecopier or
telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. Each other Lender may change its address, telecopier or telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent. In addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record (i) an effective address, contact name, telephone number, telecopier number
and electronic mail address to which notices and other communications may be sent and (ii) accurate wire instructions for such Lender. Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender

(e) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and
act upon any notices (including telephonic notices and Committed Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or
followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Related Parties
of each of them from all losses, costs,

negligence or willful misconduct. All telephonic notices to and other telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording. 
10.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person
in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan Document, are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights,
remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document,
the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Borrower or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be
instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 8.02 for the benefit of all the Lenders; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
prohibit (a) the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (b) any Lender from
exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 10.08 (subject to the terms of Section 2.15), or (c) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or
appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to the Borrower under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents , then (i) the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 and (ii) in addition
to the matters set forth in clauses (b) and (c) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 2.15, any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies
available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders.  10.04 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. 
(a) Costs and Expenses. The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable and invoiced out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, its Affiliates and the Arranger (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Arranger), in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) (it being understood and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall use a single transaction counsel in connection with the principal negotiation and documentation of the foregoing) and
(ii) all reasonable and invoiced out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender (including the fees, charges and disbursements
of any counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender which shall be limited to one primary counsel to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders taken as a whole and, if reasonably necessary, one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for

Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and
hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, which such fees, charges and disbursements of counsel shall
be limited to the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, charges and disbursements of one counsel to all Indemnitees taken as a whole and, if reasonably
necessary, one local counsel for all Indemnitees taken as a whole in each relevant jurisdiction and, solely in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest, one additional counsel (and if reasonably necessary, one local counsel in each
relevant jurisdiction) to each group of similarly situated affected Indemnitees) incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Borrower or its Affiliates arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
of (i) the Cayan Acquisition, the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or
thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the administration of this

any settlement costs and expenses related thereto), whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, IN ALL CASES, WHETHER OR NOT
CAUSED BY OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OUT OF THE COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNITEE; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, (y) result
from a claim brought by the Borrower against an Indemnitee for material breach of such Indemnitees obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such
claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or (z) arose out of, or in connection with, any proceeding that does not involve an act or omission by the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower and that is brought by an Indemnitee
against any other Indemnitee (except to the extent relating to such Indemnitee acting in an agency or other representative capacity hereunder). For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 10.04(b) shall
not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims or damages arising from any non-Tax claim. 
(c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount
required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each
Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the
applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, 
  67 



claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in
its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under
this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.14(d). 
(d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of the parties hereto
shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any other party hereto (and any Indemnitee), on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Cayan Acquisition, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof;
provided that nothing contained in this clause (d) shall limit the Borrowers indemnity and expense reimbursement obligations expressly provided for in this Agreement or any other Loan Document. No Indemnitee referred to in
subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through telecommunications,
electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten Business Days after demand
therefor.  (f) Survival. The agreements in this Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent,
the replacement of any Lender (by assignment or otherwise) and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations. 
10.05 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then
(a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and
(b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand
to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the
Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.  10.06 Successors and Assigns. 
(a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent
and 
  68 



each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection
(b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the
restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any
Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related
Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
(b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(i) Minimum Amounts. 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Loans at the time owing to it
or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
(B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the principal outstanding balance of the
Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the
Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), 8.01(f) or 8.01(g)
has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments
from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met. 
(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans assigned;  (iii) Required
Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition: 
(A) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an
Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), 8.01(f) or 8.01(g) has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an
Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless the Borrower shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten Business Days after having received notice
thereof; and 
  69 


(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of any Term Loan to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; and 
(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the
case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. 
(v) No Assignment to Borrower. No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Borrower or any of the Borrowers
Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B). 
(vi) No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural Person (or a holding company,
investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person).  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released
from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that
except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.
Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Term Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated
for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section. 
(c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower (and such agency
being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent
manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice
to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
  70 


(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or
notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person, a
Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 10.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation. 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this
Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender,
provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.15 as though it were a Lender. 
Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a
non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the
Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including
the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loan or other
obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender
shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its
capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (e) Limitations
upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive
with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation, unless the sale of
the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 3.01 unless such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.01(e) as though it were a Lender. 
  71 


(f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Term Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;
provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
10.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (each a Lender
Party) agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates respective partners, directors, officers,
employees, agents, advisors, legal counsel, independent auditors, professionals and other representatives (collectively, Representatives) (it being understood that Representatives will be informed of the confidential nature of
such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential and (ii) a party making such Information available to its Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors and employees agrees to be responsible for any breach of
this paragraph that results from the actions or omissions of such Affiliates, officers, directors and employees), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory
authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any legal process, subpoena, judicial or administrative proceeding or similar compulsory process, provided
each Lender Party agrees that it will notify the Borrower as soon as practical in the event of any such disclosure by such Lender Party (other than at the request of a regulatory authority), unless such notification shall be prohibited by applicable
Law or legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in,
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the
Borrower, (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or (i) to ratings agencies. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data
collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Agents and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Loans. 
For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any
person on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential
basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. 
  72 


Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledges that (a) the Information may
include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material
non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state
securities Laws.  10.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of
their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever
currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower
may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender and their respective Affiliates under this Section
are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and
application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  10.09
Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of
non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the
excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender
exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects
thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. 
10.10 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to
the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as
provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof
that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.  10.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made
hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will
be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of any Default at the time of any Borrowing, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied. 
  73 


10.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor
in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a
provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.12, if and to
the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in
effect only to the extent not so limited.  10.13 Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 3.01, or any Lender gives a notice under Section 3.02, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender has failed to consent to a
proposed amendment, waiver or consent which pursuant to the terms of Section 10.01 or any other provision of any Loan Document requires the consent of all Lenders or all affected Lenders or all directly
affected Lenders and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have granted their consent, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and
delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement
and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that: 
(a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in
Section 10.06(b);  (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount
equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under
Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
(c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments
thereafter;  (d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and 
(e) in the case of an assignment as a result of a failure of such Lender to approve an amendment, waiver or consent as set
forth above, the assignee shall have consented to such proposed amendment, waiver or consent.  A Lender shall not be
required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
  74 


10.14 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc. 
(a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK.  (b) SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS, FOR
ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY, TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN COUNTY AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND ANY APPELLATE COURT FROM ANY

RESPECT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH NEW YORK STATE COURT OR, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN SUCH FED

LEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY
OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT 
  75 



NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. 
10.16 No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in
connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent
and the Arranger, are arms-length commercial transactions between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Arranger, on the other hand, (B) the Borrower

with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent and the Arranger and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a
broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arranger has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or its
Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Borrower hereby agrees not to assert any claims against the Administrative Agent and the Arranger with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any
aspect of any transactions contemplated hereby.  10.17 USA PATRIOT Act Notice. Each Lender that is subject to the Patriot Act (as
hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56
(signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the Patriot Act), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other
information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. The Borrower shall, promptly following a request by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all
documentation and other information that the Administrative Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
Patriot Act.  10.18 Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents. The words execute,

Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to
the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records 
  76 



Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; provided that notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary the Administrative Agent is
under no obligation to agree to accept electronic signatures in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it. 
10.19 Termination. This Agreement shall terminate at such time as (a) none of the Lenders is obligated any longer under this
Agreement to make any Loans and (b) all other Obligations (other than contingent indemnification or contingent reimbursement obligations as to which no claim has been asserted which by their express terms are to survive termination of this
Agreement) have been paid and satisfied in full.  10.20 Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In
