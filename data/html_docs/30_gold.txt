Texas time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing, (b) in the case of a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, four Business Days before the date of the proposed
Borrowing or (c) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, one Business Day before the date of the proposed Borrowing; provided that any such notice of a Borrowing to finance the reimbursement of an
LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(e) may be given not later than 10:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed
promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the
following information in compliance with Section 2.02:  (i) the aggregate amount of the requested
Borrowing;  (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day; 
(iii) the Class of such Borrowing; 
(iv) if such Borrowing is a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Alternative Currency in which such Borrowing
will be made; 
  24 


(v) if such Borrowing is a U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Borrowing,
whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;  (vi) in the case of a Eurodollar
Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period; and 
(vii) the location and number of the Borrowers account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with
the requirements of Section 2.06.  If no election as to the Type of U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Borrowing is specified, then
the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration. Promptly
following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lenders Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.
 SECTION 2.04 Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, provided that no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to the Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in
(i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $25,000,000 or (ii) the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeding the total Revolving Loan Commitments; provided that following the occurrence and
continuance of any Default or Event of Default, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans. Each Swingline Loan shall be denominated in U.S. Dollars and shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $50,000 and not less than $100,000. 
(b) To request a Swingline Loan, a Financial Officer of the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) at the telephone number specified in Section 10.01 for borrowing requests, not later than 1:30 p.m., Houston, Texas time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall make
each Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of the Borrower with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in
Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the Issuing Lender) by 2:30 p.m., Houston, Texas time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan. Each Swingline Borrowing shall be due and payable as set forth in Section 2.09(a).
Borrower and Administrative Agent may from time to time establish one or more sweep accounts or similar automatic transfer arrangements to facilitate the funding and repayment of Swingline Loans. 
  25 


(c) The Swingline Lender may, at any time, by written notice given to the Administrative
Agent not later than 1:30 p.m., Houston, Texas time, on any Business Day require the Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day, in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of
Swingline Loans in which Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Lender, specifying in such notice such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or
Loans. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan
or Loans. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the
occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender shall comply with
its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis
mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any
participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline
Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any
such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear;
provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of
participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.  SECTION 2.05 Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit for its own account, in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period. Such Letters of Credit may be denominated in U.S. Dollars or in an Alternative Currency. In the event of
any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Lender
relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. 
  26 


(b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions. To request
the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), a Financial Officer of the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so
have been approved by the Issuing Lender) to the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or
identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with
paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit and whether such Letter of Credit is to be issued in U.S. Dollars or an Alternative Currency, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as
shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Lender, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Lenders standard form in connection with any request
for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving
effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the total LC Exposure shall not exceed $50,000,000, (ii) the total Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed the total Revolving Loan Commitments, (iii) the total
Multicurrency Credit Exposure shall not exceed $50,000,000 and (iv) no Lenders Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed such Lenders Revolving Loan Commitment.  (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit
(or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof (including Letters of Credit with automatic extension features, absent notice of termination), one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to
the Revolving Credit Termination Date; provided, however, that any Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to
in clause (ii) above).  (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of
Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Lender or the Lenders, the Issuing Lender hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Lender, a participation in such
Letter of Credit equal to such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Lender and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph
(e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of
Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or reduction
or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. 
  27 


(e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Lender shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of
a Letter of Credit, it shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. The Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon,
Houston, Texas time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower
prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, Houston, Texas time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice. In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency,
the Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Lender in U.S. Dollars, in an amount equal to the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of such LC Disbursement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000 and no Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that any such payment be financed with a U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Loan
that is an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan of the same amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to make
such payment when due (herein, the Unreimbursed Amount), the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lenders
Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in
Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Lender
the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Lender or, to
the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Lender as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse
the Issuing Lender for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Loans, Swingline Loans or Multicurrency Revolving Credit Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the
Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.  (f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrowers obligation
to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be
forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Lender, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or
delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence
arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Lender; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Lender from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential
damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Lenders failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other
documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Lender (as finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented
which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation,
regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. 
  28 


(g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Lender shall, promptly following its receipt
thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment
and whether the Issuing Lender has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Lender and the
Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.  (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Lender shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to
but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at (i) with respect to any Unreimbursed Amount denominated in U.S. Dollars, the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans and (ii) with respect to any
Unreimbursed Amount denominated in an Alternative Currency, the higher of the rate per annum then applicable to Multicurrency Revolving Credit Loans and the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that, if the Borrower
fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Lender, except that
interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Lender shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. 
(i) Replacement of the Issuing Lender. The Issuing Lender may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Lender and the successor Issuing Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Lender. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the
Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Lender shall have all the
rights and obligations of the Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Issuing Lender shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any
previous Issuing Lender, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Lenders, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Lender hereunder, the replaced Issuing Lender shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have
all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. 
  29 


(j) Cash Collateralization. If any Excess LC Exposure shall exist pursuant to
Section 2.10(c), Borrower shall Cash Collateralize 102% of such Excess LC Exposure. In addition, if any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent
or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding Cash Collateralization pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall Cash
Collateralize 102% of the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such Cash Collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due
and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Section 7.01. So long as such Excess LC Exposure or Event of
Default shall be continuing, such Cash Collateral shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion
and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account during such time. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative
Agent and at the Borrowers risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account during the continuance of such Excess LC Exposure or
Event of Default shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Lender for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement
obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy
other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of Cash Collateral hereunder as a result of the existence of Excess LC Exposure or the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the
extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after such LC Exposure no longer exists or all Events of Default have been cured or waived, as applicable. When such Excess LC Exposure or Event of
Default, as applicable, no longer exists, all funds in such account shall be remitted to the Borrower, free and clear of any rights therein in favor of the Lenders.  (k) Existing Letters of Credit. The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledge that, (i) Bank of America, N.A. has issued, for the account of one or more Obligors, the
letters of credit listed on Schedule 2.05 as having been issued by Bank of America, N.A. (the BOA Existing Letters of Credit) and (ii) Wells Fargo has issued, for the account of one or more Obligors, the letters of
credit listed on Schedule 2.05 (the Wells Fargo Existing Letters of Credit). The aggregate undrawn amount of the BOA Existing Letters of Credit and the Wells Fargo Existing Letters of Credit are part of the aggregate LC
Exposure so that the amount available under each Lenders Revolving Loan Commitment shall be reduced by such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such undrawn amount. If the Borrower desires to extend the existing expiry date of any BOA
Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall submit a notice described in Section 2.05(b) to Bank of America, N.A. as the Issuing Lender of the BOA Existing Letters of Credit, and if the Borrower desires to extend the existing expiry date of any
Wells Fargo Existing Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall submit a notice described in Section 2.05(b) to Wells Fargo, as the Issuing Lender of the Wells Fargo Existing Letters of Credit. 
SECTION 2.06 Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date
thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by (i) 12:00 noon, Houston, Texas time for all Loans denominated in Dollars and (ii) 2:00 p.m. London time for all Multicurrency Revolving Credit Loans, each to the account of the
Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the
Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in Houston, Texas and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that
ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Lender. 
  30 


(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the
proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to
the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance
with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such
Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing.  SECTION 2.07 Interest Elections. (a) Each Borrowing initially
shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request; provided all Multicurrency Revolving Credit Borrowings must
be Eurodollar Borrowings. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert any such Borrowing that is a U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Borrowing to a different Type or to continue any Borrowing and, in the case of any Borrowing that is a Eurodollar
Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among
the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued. 
  31 


(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective
date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the
Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.  (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the
following information in compliance with Section 2.02:  (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest
Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses
(iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);  (ii) the effective date of
the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;  (iii) if such
Borrowing is a U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Borrowing, whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and  (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
term Interest Period.  If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest
Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.  (d) Promptly
following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing. 
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing that is a
U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a
continuation of such Borrowing with an Interest Period of one months duration. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required
Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Borrowing may be converted to or, upon the expiration of its then in effect Interest Period, continued as
a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Borrowing that is a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. 
  32 


SECTION 2.08 Termination and Reduction of Commitments. 
(a) Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Loan Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Credit Termination Date. 
(b) The Borrower may at any time and from time to time terminate or from time to time reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments;
provided that (A) each reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (B) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Loan
Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Revolving Loan Commitments. 
(c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments under
paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state
that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not
satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be made ratably among the Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Loan Commitments.
 SECTION 2.09 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay
(i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Revolving Credit Termination Date, and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal
amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of (A) demand by the Swingline Lender, (B) the last day of each March, June, September and December and (C) the Revolving Credit Termination Date; provided that on each date that a
Revolving Borrowing is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding. 
  33 


(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts
evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. 
(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class
and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lenders share thereof.  (d) The entries made
in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and
deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) in the form of Exhibit E hereto. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note
and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a
registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).  SECTION 2.10 Prepayment of Loans. (a) Voluntary
Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section. 
(b) Notice of Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a
Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, three Business Days before the date
of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 1:30
p.m., Houston, Texas time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of
prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in
accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be
in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12.

  34 


(c) Over-Advances and Excess Exposure. If for any reason (i) the total Revolving
Credit Exposures exceeds the total Revolving Loan Commitments or (ii) the total Multicurrency Credit Exposures exceeds $50,000,000, then in each case the Borrower shall promptly, and in any event within two Business Days, make a prepayment of
the Loans to the Administrative Agent for the accounts of the Lenders in an amount equal to such excess, and if, after giving effect to such prepayment of the Loans, any excess still remains (such remaining excess is herein the Excess LC
Exposure), Borrower shall Cash Collateralize, in accordance with Section 2.05(j) any outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount equal to 102% of such Excess LC Exposure. Prepayments required by this paragraph shall be
accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower may elect to provide Cash Collateral to the Administrative
Agent in lieu of repaying the Loans pursuant to this paragraph in order to avoid breakage costs. Such Cash Collateral will be equal to 100% of the repayment required by this paragraph, and will otherwise be subject to the provisions of
Section 2.05(j). Such Cash Collateral will be applied by the Administrative Agent at the end of the relevant Interest Period to the repayment of the Loans.  (d) Asset Sales If at the end of any fiscal quarter the aggregate Excess Proceeds for the current fiscal year exceeds $15,000,000, Borrower shall within thirty (30) days following the end of
such fiscal quarter repay the Loans in a principal amount equal to the positive difference (if any) between (i) the amount by which such Excess Proceeds exceeds $15,000,000 and (ii) the sum of all principal repayments made on the Loans
during the immediately preceding four fiscal quarters.  SECTION 2.11 Fees. (a) The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Margin on the daily amount of the unused Revolving Loan Commitment of such Revolving Credit Lender calculated as if no
Swingline Loans were outstanding (and for avoidance of doubt, the amount of outstanding Letters of Credit will be considered used portions) during the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date on which such
Revolving Loan Commitment terminates; provided that, if such Revolving Credit Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Revolving Loan Commitment terminates, then such commitment fee shall continue to accrue on the
daily amount of such Revolving Credit Lenders Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its Revolving Loan Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which it ceases to have any Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued
commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Revolving Loan Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof;
provided that any commitment fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Loan Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the
actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Any fees owing to a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to Section 2.20(a)(iii). 
  35 


(b) The Borrower shall pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which (A) with respect to Letters of Credit denominated in U.S. Dollars shall accrue at the same Applicable Margin used to determine the interest rate
applicable to Eurodollar U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Loans and (B) with respect to Letters of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency shall accrue at the same Applicable Margin used to determine the interest rate applicable to
Eurodollar Multicurrency Revolving Credit Loans, each on the average daily amount of such Revolving Credit Lenders LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including
the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Revolving Credit Lenders Commitment terminates and the date on which it ceases to have any LC Exposure and (ii) to the Issuing Lender a fronting fee of
0.125% per annum of the face amount of each Letter of Credit issued hereunder, which shall be payable upon the issuance of such Letter of Credit and thereafter as set forth in the next sentence, as well as the Issuing Lenders standard
fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall
be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date, and fronting fees accrued on each outstanding Letter of Credit through each anniversary of the Closing Date shall be
payable on the third Business Day following such anniversary date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving Loan Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving
Loan Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Lender pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All participation and fronting fees payable with respect to a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency
shall be paid in U.S. Dollars in an amount equal to the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such participation and fronting fees. Any fees owing to a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to
Section 2.20(a)(iii).  (c) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in
the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter, or otherwise separately agreed upon, between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.  (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing Lender, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution,
in the case of commitment fees and participation fees, to the Revolving Credit Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.  SECTION 2.12 Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. 
(b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for
such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin.  (c) Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the
Applicable Margin. 
  36 


(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or
other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, or any other Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Loan shall bear interest, after as well as before
judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) with respect to any amount required hereunder to be denominated in U.S. Dollars, 2% per annum plus the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans and (ii) with respect to any amount required
hereunder to be denominated in an Alternative Currency, 2% per annum plus the higher of the rate per annum then applicable to Multicurrency Revolving Credit Loans and the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans. 
(e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the cas

amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any
conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. 
(f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the
Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and interest computed on Multicurrency Revolving Credit Loans denominated in
British Pound Sterling shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The
applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
SECTION 2.13 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
 (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or  (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;  then the Administrative Agent shall
give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer
exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing for such affected Interest Period shall be ineffective, and (ii) if any Borrowing
Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing for such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of
Borrowings shall be permitted. 
  37 


SECTION 2.14 Increased Costs, Illegality. (a) If any Change in Law shall:
 (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of,
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Lender; or 
(ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this
Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;  and the result of any of the foregoing
shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Lender of participating in, issuing or
maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then upon request of such Lender or Issuing Lender, accompanied
by any related certification required hereunder, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, for such
additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law
affecting such Persons capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders holding
company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing
Lender or such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders or
the Issuing Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, upon request of such Lender or Issuing Lender, accompanied by any related certification required hereunder, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or
the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
(c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing
Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing
Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof. 
  38 


(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Lender to demand compensation
pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Lender
pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions and of such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.  (e) If any Lender determines,
acting reasonably and in good faith, that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any central bank or Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose
interest is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBO Rate, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to
purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or
continue Eurodollar Loans in the affected currency or currencies or to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining ABR Loans the interest rate on
which is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to
the LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the
Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay such Eurodollar Loans or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in U.S. Dollars, convert all Eurodollar Loans of such Lender to ABR Loans or
(y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining ABR Loans (the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate), the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such
Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such
Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued
interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 
  39 


SECTION 2.15 Break Funding Payments and Compensation for Losses. In the event of
(a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or as a result of Section 2.10(c) or 2.10(d)),
(b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered
pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.10(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, or (e) any payment by the Borrower made in a different currency from the currency in which such payment is required to be made under this Agreement, then, in
any such event, the Borrower shall, upon request of an affected Lender, compensate such Lender for the loss, cost and expense resulting from such event. In the case of breakage costs with respect to a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to
any Lender may be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate
that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been
the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in
the relevant currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to
the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof. 
SECTION 2.16 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free
and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased
as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law.
 (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
Law.  (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Lender, within 10 Business Days
after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation
of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.16) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, except as a result of the finding by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable order that said sums were imposed as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Administrative Agent or Issuing
Lender, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or
the Issuing Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. No Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Lender shall be entitled to receive any
payment with respect to Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes that are incurred or accrued more than 180 days prior to the date such Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Lender gives notice and demand thereof to the Borrower. 
  40 


(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the
Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of any receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return reporting such payment
or other evidence of such payment as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.  (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled
to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the Law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or under any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable Law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such
payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Each
Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as may be reasonably necessary
(including the designation of a new Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of the applicable laws of any such jurisdiction that the Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender
shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter
upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable: 
(i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax
treaty to which the United States is a party,  (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8ECI,  (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest
under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of the
Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN, or 
  41 


any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United
States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. 
(f) If a payment made to a Recipient under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if
such Recipient were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Recipient shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and
such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Recipient has
complied with such Recipients obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. 
(g) Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such
Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt
from United States federal backup withholding tax.  (h) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its reasonable
discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall pay over
such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the
Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information
relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
  42 


(i) Each Lender and Issuing Lender shall use its best efforts (consistent with its internal
policies and legal and regulatory restrictions) to select a jurisdiction for its applicable lending office or change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office, as the case may be, so as to avoid the imposition of any Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes or to eliminate or reduce the payment of any additional sums under this Section 2.16; provided that no such selection or change of the jurisdiction for its applicable lending office shall be made if, in the reasonable
judgment of such Lender or Issuing Lender, such selection or change would be materially disadvantageous to such Lender and Issuing Lender.  SECTION 2.17 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. 
(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative
Currency, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made in U.S. Dollars. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative
Currency shall be made in such Alternative Currency; provided that if for any reason the Borrower is prohibited by applicable Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall make such payment in
U.S. Dollars in an amount equal to the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the amount due in such Alternative Currency as of the date of payment.  (b) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under
Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, Houston, Texas time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may,
in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 1000
Louisiana Street, Houston, Texas, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 10.03 shall
be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment
hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such
extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars except as otherwise provided in Section 2.05.  (c) If at
any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards
payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC
Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties. 
  43 


(d) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise,
obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the
Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered,
such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to
and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation
in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the
foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.  (e)
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make
such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount
due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender or Issuing Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.  (f) If any Lender
shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or 2.05(e), 2.06(b) or 2.17(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary
provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. 
SECTION 2.18 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender or Issuing Lender requests compensation under
Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, Issuing Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender
or Issuing Lender (as the case may be) shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans or issuing its Letters of Credit hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of
its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender or Issuing Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case
may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender or Issuing Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or Issuing Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by any Lender or Issuing Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
  44 


(b) If any Lender or Issuing Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or
if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or Issuing Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender or Issuing Lender is a
Defaulting Lender or if any other circumstance exists hereunder which gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender or Issuing Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender or Issuing
Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender or Issuing Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent
of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of
all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a
reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such
assignment and delegation cease to apply and the Borrower has not already arranged for one or more replacement Lenders. 
SECTION 2.19 Increase of Commitments. (a) If no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Borrower may at any time and from time to time request an increase of the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments by notice to the Administrative Agent in writing of the amount of such proposed increase (such notice, a Commitment Increase
Notice); provided, however, that (i) each such increase shall be at least $25,000,000, (ii) the cumulative increase in Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall not exceed $100,000,000 (so that the
maximum amount of the revised Revolving Loan Commitments shall not be greater than $250,000,000) and (iii) the Revolving Loan Commitment of any Lender may not be increased without such Lenders consent. The Administrative Agent shall
communicate such Commitment Increase Notice to the Lenders as directed by the Borrower. Any Lender that accepts an offer to it by the Borrower to increase its Revolving Loan Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall, in each case,
execute a Commitment Increase Agreement with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, whereupon such Lender shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement with respect to the full amount of its Revolving Loan Commitment as so
increased, and the definition of Revolving Loan Commitment in Section 1.01 hereof shall be deemed to be amended to reflect such increase. No Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to increase its Revolving Loan Commitment.

  45 


(b) The Borrower may, in its sole discretion, but with the consent of the Administrative
Agent as to any Person that is not at such time a Lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), offer to one or more additional banks or financial institutions the opportunity to participate in all or a portion of the
increased Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) below, as applicable, by notifying the Administrative Agent.  (c) Any additional bank or financial institution that the Borrower selects to offer participation in the increased Revolving Loan Commitments shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a New
Lender Agreement setting forth its Revolving Loan Commitment, and upon the effectiveness of such New Lender Agreement such bank or financial institution (a New Lender) shall become a Lender for all purposes and to the same extent
as if originally a party hereto and shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement, and the signature pages hereof shall be deemed to be amended to add the name of such New Lender and the definition of Revolving Loan Commitment in
Section 1.01 hereof shall be deemed amended to increase the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments of the Lenders by the Revolving Loan Commitment of such New Lender, provided that the Revolving Loan Commitment of any New Lender
shall be an amount not less than $5,000,000. Each New Lender Agreement shall be irrevocable and shall be effective upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent at the same time as that of all other New Lenders. 
(d) Any Lender that accepts an offer to it by the Borrower to increase its Revolving Loan Commitment pursuant to this
Section 2.19 shall, in each case, execute a Commitment Increase Agreement with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, whereupon such Lender shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement with respect to the full
amount of its Revolving Loan Commitment as so increased, and the definition of Revolving Loan Commitment in Section 1.01 hereof shall be deemed to be amended to reflect such increase. 
(e) The effectiveness of any New Lender Agreement or Commitment Increase Agreement shall be contingent upon receipt by the Administrative
Agent of such corporate resolutions of the Borrower and legal opinions of counsel to the Borrower as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request with respect thereto, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent. Once a New Lender Agreement or Commitment Increase Agreement becomes effective, the Administrative Agent shall reflect the increases in the Commitments effected by such agreements by appropriate entries in the Register.
 (f) If any bank or financial institution becomes a New Lender pursuant to Section 2.19(c) or any Lenders
Revolving Loan Commitment is increased pursuant to Section 2.19(d), additional Revolving Loans made on or after the effectiveness thereof (the Re-Allocation Date) shall be made pro rata based on their respective
Revolving Loan Commitments in effect on or after such Re-Allocation Date (except to the extent that any such pro rata borrowings would result in any Lender making an aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans in excess of its Revolving Loan
Commitment, in which case such excess amount will be allocated to, and made by, such New Lender and/or Lenders with such increased Revolving Loan Commitments to the extent of, and pro rata based on, their respective Revolving Loan Commitments), and
continuations of Loans outstanding on such Re-Allocation Date shall be effected by repayment of such Loans on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto or, in the case of ABR Loans, on the date of such increase, and the making of new
Loans of the same Type pro rata based on the respective Revolving Loan Commitments in effect on and after such Re-Allocation Date. 
  46 


(g) If on any Re-Allocation Date there is an unpaid principal amount of Eurodollar Loans,
such Eurodollar Loans shall remain outstanding with the respective holders thereof until the expiration of their respective Interest Periods (unless the Borrower elects to prepay any thereof in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Agreement), and interest on and repayments of such Eurodollar Loans will be paid thereon to the respective Lenders holding such Eurodollar Loans pro rata based on the respective principal amounts thereof outstanding. 
SECTION 2.20 Defaulting Lenders.  (a) Defaulting Lender Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer
a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:  (i) Such Defaulting Lenders right to
approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.  (ii) Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to
Article VII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first,
to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender
hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.20(b); fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or
Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash
Collateralize the Issuing Lenders future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.20(b); sixth, to the
payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a
result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a
court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or LC Disbursements in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and
(y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LC Disbursements
owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LC Disbursements owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of
Credit and Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments without giving effect to Section 2.20(a)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are
applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
  47 


(iii) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commitment fee
as described in Section 2.11(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any Commitment Fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting
Lender). Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive a participation fee with respect to its participation in Letters of Credit as described in Section 2.11(b) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only
to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.20(b). With respect to any such fee not required to be paid to a Defaulting
Lender pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lenders participation in Letters of
Credit that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to the Issuing Lender the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to the Issuing
Lenders Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.  (iv) All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders participation in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective
Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the
Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the
aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Loan Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a
Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation. 
  48 


(v) If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can
only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Lenders Fronting Exposure and
(y) second, Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.20(b).  (b) Cash Collateralization.  (i) At any time that there
shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) the Borrower shall (at the Borrowers option) either
(A) Cash Collateralize 100% of the Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender and Section 2.20(a)(iv)) or
(B) prepay Loans in an amount sufficient to reduce Fronting Exposure to zero.  (ii) The Borrower, and to
the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lender, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as
security for the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of Letters of Credit, to be applied pursuant to paragraph (iii) below. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that such Cash Collateral is
subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than 100% of the Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure with respect
to the Defaulting Lender, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any
Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).  (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.20 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of Letters of Credit
(including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.

  49 


(iv) Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce
any Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.20 following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of
Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to Section 2.20(a) the Person
providing Cash Collateral and the Issuing Lender may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.  (c) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Lender agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the
Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender
will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in
Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Revolving Loan Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.20(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;
provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent
otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.
 (d) New Swingline Loans/Letters of Credit. So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swingline Lender
shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swingline Loan and (ii) the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any
Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.  SECTION 2.21
Additional Alternative Currencies. Borrower may from time to time request that Multicurrency Revolving Credit Loans be made, or Letters of Credit be issued, in a currency other than those specifically listed in the definition of
Alternative Currency; provided that such requested currency is a lawful currency that is readily available and freely transferable and convertible into U.S. Dollars. In the case of any such request with respect to the making of
Multicurrency Revolving Credit Loans, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and in the case of any such request with respect to the issuance of Letters of Credit, such request shall be subject to
the approval of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders.

such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The Lender serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall
have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the
Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other
number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion
of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any debtor relief law
or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any debtor relief law, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose,
and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided
in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to
the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this
Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein,
(iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to
confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. 
  72 


The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability
for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any
statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. 
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower, if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), to appoint a successor . If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent
gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, appoint a successor Administrative Agent with the consent of the Borrower, if no Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), which shall be a bank with an office in Houston, Texas, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees
payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agents resignation hereunder, the
provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this
Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.  The Lenders identified on the facing page
of this Agreement as Co-Lead Arrangers, Syndication Agents, Documentation Agents or any similar titles, if any, shall not have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all
Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, the Lenders so identified as Co- Lead Arrangers, Syndication Agents or Documentation Agents (or having any similar title) shall not have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any
Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on the Lender so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder. 
ARTICLE IX 
Subsidiary Guarantee  SECTION 9.01 The Guarantee. Each Guarantor hereby jointly, severally and unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the full and punctual payment (whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or
otherwise) of the principal of and interest (including any interest fees, and other amounts that would accrue but for the filing of a petition under Title 11 of the United States Code) on each Loan, whether outstanding now or in the future, and
the full and punctual payment of all other Obligations payable by the Borrower or any other Guarantor under the Loan Documents. Upon failure by the Borrower or any other Guarantor to pay punctually any such amount, each Guarantor shall forthwith on
demand pay the amount not so paid at the place and in the manner specified in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. This Guarantee is a guaranty of payment and not of collection. The Lenders shall not be required to exhaust any right or remedy
or take any action against the Borrower or any other Person or any collateral. The Guarantor agrees that, as between the Guarantor and the Lenders, the Obligations may be declared to be due and payable for the purposes of this Guarantee
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition which may prevent, delay or vitiate any declaration as regards the Borrower and that in the event of a declaration or attempted declaration, the Obligations shall immediately become due and
payable by each Guarantor for the purposes of this Guaranty.  SECTION 9.02 Guaranty Unconditional. The obligations of
each Guarantor hereunder shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by:  (a) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Guarantor under the Loan Documents, by operation of law or otherwise;

  74 


(b) any restatement, modification, amendment or waiver of or supplement to the Loan
Documents (including any increase in the Commitments);  (c) any release, impairment, non-perfection or invalidity of any direct
or indirect security for any obligation of the Borrower or any other Guarantor under the Loan Documents;  (d) any change in the
corporate or other organizational existence, structure or ownership of the Borrower or any other Guarantor, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Borrower, any other Guarantor or their respective
assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Guarantor contained in the Loan Documents;  (e) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which the Guarantor may have at any time against the Borrower, any other Guarantor, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person,
whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions;  (f) any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against
the Borrower or any other Guarantor for any reason of the Loan Documents, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by the Borrower or any other Guarantor of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any
other amount payable by the Borrower or any other Guarantor under the Loan Documents; or  (g) any other act or omission to act
or delay of any kind by the Borrower, any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the
Guarantors or the Borrowers obligations hereunder or defense of a surety (except for indefeasible payment in full). 
SECTION 9.03 Discharge Only upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement In Certain Circumstances. Each Guarantors obligations
hereunder shall remain in full force and effect until (i) the Commitments shall have terminated and the principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable by the Obligors under the Loan Documents shall have been indefeasibly
paid in full or (ii) it has been released pursuant to Section 9.08, whichever event is the earlier to occur. If at any time any payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount payable by the Obligors under
the Loan Documents is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Obligor or otherwise, each Guarantors obligations (other than those of a Guarantor that was released pursuant to
Section 9.08) hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had been due but not made at such time. The Guarantors (other than any Guarantor that was released pursuant to
Section 9.08) jointly and severally agree to indemnify each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration,
including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, other than any costs or
expenses resulting from the bad faith or willful misconduct of such Lender. 
  75 


SECTION 9.04 Waiver by Each Guarantor. Each Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance
hereof, diligence, presentment, demand, protest, notice of acceleration or the intent to accelerate and any other notice not provided for in this Article, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against the
Borrower or any other Guarantor or any other Person. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor hereby waives the right by statute or otherwise to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to institute suit against
Borrower or any other Guarantor or to exhaust any rights and remedies which any of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders has or may have against the Borrower or any other Guarantor. Each Guarantor further waives any defense arising by reason of
any disability or other defense (other than the defense that the Obligations shall have been performed and paid in the manner provided for in the applicable Loan Documents, to the extent of any such payment) of the Borrower or by reason of the
cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of Borrower in respect thereof. Each Guarantor hereby waives any right to notice of the creation, advancement, increase, existence, extension, renewal, rearrangement and/or modification of the
Obligations.  SECTION 9.05 Subrogation. Each Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Lenders, the Administrative
Agent and the holders of the Loans against the Borrower in respect of any amounts paid by such Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of this Article IX; provided that such Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce or to receive any
payments arising out of or based upon such right of subrogation until the principal of and interest on the Loans and all other sums at any time payable by the Borrower under the Loan Documents shall have been indefeasibly paid in full. If any amount
is paid to the Guarantor on account of subrogation rights under this Guaranty at any time when all the Obligations have not been indefeasibly paid in full, the amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Lenders and shall be promptly paid
to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied to the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured or absolute or contingent, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
SECTION 9.06 Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by any Obligor under the Loan
Documents is stayed upon insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by each Guarantor hereunder forthwith on demand by
the Administrative Agent made at the request of the requisite proportion of the Required Lenders.  SECTION 9.07 Limit of
Liability. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law.  SECTION 9.08 Release upon Sale. Upon any
sale of a Guarantor (whether by disposition of Equity Interests, merger, disposition of all or substantially all of its assets or otherwise) not prohibited by this Agreement, such Guarantor shall automatically and without further action by any
Lender or the Administrative Agent be released from its obligations under each Loan Document, including as a Guarantor hereunder, and the Administrative Agent will, at the expense of Borrower, execute and deliver such documents as are reasonably
necessary to evidence said release. Borrower shall give written notice to the Administrative Agent promptly following any sale giving rise to a release pursuant to this Section 9.08.

SECTION 9.09 Benefit to Guarantor. Each Guarantor acknowledges that the Loans made to
the Borrower will be, in part, re-loaned to, or used for the benefit of, such Guarantor and its Affiliates, that each Guarantor, because of the utilization of the proceeds of the Loans, will benefit directly or indirectly from the Loans and that
such Loans will directly or indirectly benefit its operations and its ability to carry on its business as presently conducted.

provided, however, that any financial statements, other information or notice required to be delivered by the Borrower to a Lender may be furnished or delivered by the Borrower to the address for such Lender as furnished to the
Borrower by the Administrative Agent.  (b) Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or

Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps

not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter
of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. 
  78 


(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, neither this Agreement nor the other Loan Documents
nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of
the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of
interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, provided, that only the consent of parties thereto shall be necessary to amend the Fee Letter, (iii) postpone the
scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any
Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.17(c) or (d) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of
each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section 10.02(b) or the definition of Required Lenders or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify
any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) in the event any collateral is pledged as security for the Obligations, release any significant portion of such
collateral without the written consent of each Lender, provided, that nothing herein shall prohibit the Administrative Agent from releasing any collateral, or require the consent of the other Lenders for such release, in respect of items
sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of to the extent such sale, transfer or disposal is permitted or not prohibited under any of the Loan Documents, (vii) release any Guarantees without the written consent of each Lender (other than in
connection with any transactions permitted by the Loan Documents) or (viii) modify the definition of Interest Period to permit a period of longer than six (6) months without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that
no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the
Swingline Lender, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 10.02, it is agreed that the Lenders having Commitments or outstanding balances within a Class of Loans will be the Lenders affected by changes described in clauses
(ii) and (iii) above with respect to such Class.  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting
Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder or under any other Loan Document, nor shall any such Lenders vote or status as a Lender be required in determining majority, unanimity or other
condition or effect of any vote except that the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender.  SECTION 10.03 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including
the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel and consultants for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, due diligence undertaken by the Administrative Agent with
respect to the financing contemplated by this Agreement, the preparation and administration of this Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall
be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of consultants for the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders and including
fees and expenses of a single counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders (provided, that any Lender may retain separate counsel in the event of an actual conflict of interest and the Borrower shall pay all
reasonable fees, cost and expenses of such additional counsel), in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or
Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit. 
  79 


(b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and each
Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses,
including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement,
the Commitment Letter dated November 9, 2012 (the Commitment Letter), among the Borrower and Wells Fargo, or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective
obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Lender to honor a demand
for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from
any real property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to
any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. 
(c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or
the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lenders Applicable Percentage
(determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case
may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such.  (d) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Borrower and the Guarantors shall not assert, and hereby waive, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or
the use of the proceeds thereof.  (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand
therefor. 
  80 


SECTION 10.04 Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Lender that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not
assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender
may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Lender that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of: 
(A) the Borrower, provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an
Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; and  (B) the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender, provided that no such consent shall be required for an assignment of any Revolving Loan Commitment to an assignee that is
a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment; 
(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: 
(A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender from an assigning Lender that has retained a Commitment of at least
$5,000,000 or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the
Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of
the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 
  81 


(B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, provided that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights
and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans;  (C) the parties to each assignment shall
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500;  (D) no such assignment shall be made to (1) the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (2) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who,
upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute a Person described in this clause (2);  (E) In connection
with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such
additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or sub-participations, or other compensating
actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor
hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, the Swingline Lender and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued
thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting
Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs; and  (F) the assignee, if it shall not
be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. 
  82 


For the purposes of this Section 10.04(b), the term
Approved Fund has the following meaning:  Approved Fund means any Person
(other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in committed revolving credit loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a
Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.  (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall
be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease
to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 10.03), provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment
by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that
does not comply with this Section 10.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. 
(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name
is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Lender and any
Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice, and at any time and from time to time, the Borrower may request and receive from the Administrative Agent a copy of the Register then in effect. 
(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the
assignees completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment
required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless
it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. 
  83 


(c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that the Participant shall be bound by Section 10.12 as if it were a Lender, and that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without
the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(d) as though it were a Lender. 
(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than
the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent. A Participant that
would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the
Borrower, to comply with Sections 2.16(e), (f) and (g) as though it were a Lender.  (iii) Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant
and the principal amounts of (and stated interest on) each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose
all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to
any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The
entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement
notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
  84 


(d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a
security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto and all costs, fees
and expenses related to such pledge, including the release thereof, shall be for the sole account of such Lender without, for the avoidance of doubt, direct or indirect reimbursement therefor from Borrower or any other Obligor. 
SECTION 10.05 Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower and the Guarantors in the
Loan Documents shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Lenders and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any
such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended
hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and
so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 10.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof. 
SECTION 10.06 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and may be delivered in
original or facsimile or electronic form (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other
Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in
Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of
each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of an original manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
 SECTION 10.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. 
  85 


SECTION 10.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final)
at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any Guarantor against the then-matured (whether by reason of acceleration or otherwise) portion of any and
all of the obligations of the Borrower and the Guarantors now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement; provided that in the
event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.20 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, and (y) the
Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.  SECTION
10.09 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) This Agreement and the Loan Documents shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York without regard to any choice-of-law
provisions that would require the application of the law of another jurisdiction.  (b) Each Letter of Credit shall be governed
by the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 600 (2007 version), and any amendment to, or successor of, such publication (the UCP 600) and, to the extent not
inconsistent with the UCP 600, the laws of the State of New York, and in the event that the provisions of the UCP 600 conflict with the laws of the State of New York, then to the extent permitted by Law, the provisions of the UCP 600 shall control;
provided that any Letter of Credit may be governed by such other law, convention or practice, or such exceptions as the Borrower may reasonably request in the related Letter of Credit application, subject to the approval of the Issuing Lender
in its sole discretion.  (c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of the State courts of Texas sitting in Harris County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of Texas, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
such Texas State or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against
the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. 
  86 


(d) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (c) of this Section. Each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. 
(e) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in
Section 10.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.  SECTION 10.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.  SECTION 10.11 Headings. Article and

Parties agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential and will agree to maintain such confidences
as a continuing condition to its receipt of such Information), (b) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process (in each such case, such Person shall notify the Borrower of such occurrence
as soon as reasonably possible following the service of any such process on such Person), (c) to any other party to this Agreement, (d) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (e) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or
Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (f) with the consent
of the Borrower or (g) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Information shall not include, and each Lender (and each employee, representative or other agent of any Lender) may disclose to any and all
Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any
kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are or have been provided to such Lender relating to such tax treatment or tax structure; provided that with respect to any document or similar item that in either case contains information
concerning such tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby as well as other Information, this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar items that relate to such tax treatment or tax structure.
For the purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or any Affiliate of them, or any of their respective businesses, other
than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or
any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information provided that such Person exercises at least a
reasonable standard of care. 
  87 


SECTION 10.13 Interest Rate Limitation. It is the intention of the Administrative
Agent, Issuing Lender, each Lender, the Borrower and each Guarantor to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, if any party hereto contracts for, charges, receives,
reserves, collects or takes any consideration from the Borrower or any other Obligor which constitutes interest in excess of the maximum amount permitted by applicable law or of the Maximum Rate, then any such excess shall be canceled automatically
and, if previously paid, shall at such Lenders option be applied to the outstanding amount of the loans made hereunder by such Lender to the Borrower or be refunded to such Obligor, and in no event shall any Person ever be liable for the
payment of unearned interest on, or in respect or any part of, the Obligations. In calculating all sums paid or agreed to be paid to any party hereto by a Borrower or any other Obligor for the use, forbearance, or detention of money under the Loan
Documents, (x) such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread in equal parts throughout the term of the Loan Documents, (y) the parties shall, to the maximum extent not
prohibited by applicable law, characterize any nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than interest, and (z) the parties shall exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof. To the extent lawful, the consideration
that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but was not payable as a result of the operation of this paragraph shall be cumulated and the consideration payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not
above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender. 
  88 


SECTION 10.14 Judgment Currency. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any
court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in U.S. Dollars into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with
normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase U.S. Dollars with such other currency at its principal foreign exchange trading office at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.
If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in a another currency into U.S. Dollars, the parties agree to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used
shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase such currency with U.S. Dollars at its principal foreign exchange trading office at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the Business Day preceding
that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any sum due from it in any currency (the Primary Currency) to any Lender (including any Issuing Lender) or the Administrative Agent hereunder
shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any other currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other
currency, such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the applicable Primary Currency with such other currency; if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased
is less than such sum due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) against such loss, and if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased exceeds such sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency,
such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) agrees to remit to the Borrower such excess.  SECTION 10.15
USA Patriot Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the Obligors that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001) (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder,, the Patriot Act)), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Obligors, which information includes the name and address of the Obligors and any other information that will allow such
Lender to identify any Obligor in accordance with the Patriot Act.  SECTION 10.16 FINAL AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES.
This is the final agreement of the parties regarding the matters herein expressed, and there are no oral agreements in regard hereto. Any previous agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof is superseded by this
Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.
