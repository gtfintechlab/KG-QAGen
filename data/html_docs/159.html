Rates; LIBOR Notification</u>. The interest rate on an Advance may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that is, or may
in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Regulators have signaled the need to use alternative benchmark
reference rates for some of these interest rate benchmarks and, as a result, such interest rate benchmarks may cease to
comply with applicable laws and regulations, may be permanently discontinued, and/or the basis on which they are calculated
may change. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain
short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market.  In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct
Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate
submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administration, the
 "IBA") for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate.  As a result, it is possible that
commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate
reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on Advances. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector
industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London
interbank offered rate.  Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early
Opt-In Election, Section 3.02 provide a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest.  The Administrative
Agent will promptly notify the Company, pursuant to Section 3.02, of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest
rate on an Advance is based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall
not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the London interbank
offered rate or other rates in the definition of "LIBO Rate" (or any other Reference Rate or definition related
thereto, as applicable) or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including,
without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to Section 3.02(b) or (c),
whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, and
(ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to Section 3.02(d)), including without
limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will
be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBO Rate (or the applicable Reference Rate) or have
the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate (or the applicable Reference Rate) prior to its
discontinuance or unavailability.</p>
