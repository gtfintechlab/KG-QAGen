The Credits
 
SECTION 2.01.  Revolving Credit Commitments.  Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, to make Revolving Loans to the Borrower denominated in Dollars from time to time during the Availability Period in principal amounts as will not result in such Lenders Revolving Loans exceeding such Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment.  Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.
 
SECTION 2.02.  Revolving Loans.  (a)  Each Revolving Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Revolving Loans of the same Type made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments.  The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders are several and other than as expressly provided herein with respect to a Defaulting Lender, no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lenders failure to make Revolving Loans as required hereby.
 
29





 
(b)   Subject to Sections 2.08 and 2.15, each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Revolving Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Loans as the Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.03. Each Lender may at its option make any Revolving Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Revolving Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Revolving Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided, however, that the Revolving Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is (i) an integral multiple of $500,000 and (ii) not less than $1,000,000; provided, further, that the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing that, if made, would result in more than eight Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding hereunder at any time. For purposes of the foregoing, Borrowings having different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Borrowings.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, an ABR Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount which is equal to the entire unused balance of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments.
 
(c)   Each Lender shall make each Revolving Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account in New York City as the Administrative Agent may designate not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time (or on the Closing Date, such earlier time as notified to the Lenders prior to the Closing Date).  The Administrative Agent shall promptly credit the amounts so received to an account designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts so received to the respective Lenders.
 
(d)   Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender, prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.03 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Revolving Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrower
 
30





 
shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
 
SECTION 2.03.  Borrowing Procedure.  In order to request a Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before a proposed Borrowing, and (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the same Business Day of a proposed Borrowing or such other prior notice reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent.  Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable, and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or fax to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request and shall specify the following information: (i) whether the Borrowing then being requested is to be a Eurodollar Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing; (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the number and location of the account to which funds are to be disbursed; (iv) the amount of such Borrowing; (v) if such Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto; and (vi) that as of the date of such Borrowing, the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any contrary specification in any Borrowing Request, each requested Borrowing shall comply with the requirements set forth in Section 2.02.  If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing.  If no Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the applicable Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.03 (and the contents thereof), and of each Lenders portion of the requested Borrowing.
 
SECTION 2.04.  Evidence of Debt; Repayment of Revolving Loans.  (a)  The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid outstanding principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Maturity Date.
 
(b)   Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Revolving Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.
 
(c)   The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Revolving Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and, if applicable, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor and each Lenders share thereof.
 
(d)   The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
 
31





 
obligations of the Borrower to repay the Revolving Loans in accordance with their terms; provided, further, in the event of a conflict between the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) above, the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) above shall govern.
 
(e)   Any Lender may request through the Administrative Agent that Revolving Loans made by it hereunder be evidenced by a promissory note.  In such event, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender and its registered assigns and in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event any Lender shall request and receive such a promissory note, the interests represented by such note shall at all times (including after any assignment of all or part of such interests pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes payable to the payee named therein or its registered assigns.
 
SECTION 2.05.  Fees.  (a)   The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the administrative fees set forth in the Administrative Agent Fee Letter (the Administrative Agent Fees).
 
(b)   All Administrative Agent Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent. Once paid, none of the Administrative Agent Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.
 
(c)   The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.50% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments terminate.  Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the first Business Day following the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof.  All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  For purposes of computing commitment fees, a Revolving Credit Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans.
 
(d)   In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay on the Closing Date upfront fees as set forth in the Fee Letter dated as of January 16, 2013 among the Borrower, Royal Bank and the Joint Lead Arrangers party thereto.
 
(e)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to Section 2.23, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any amount to (or for the account of) any Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.05.
 
SECTION 2.06.  Interest on Revolving Loans.  (a)  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.07, the Revolving Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be,
 
32





 
when the Alternate Base Rate is determined by reference to the Prime Rate and over a year of 360 days at all other times and calculated from and including the date of such Borrowing to but excluding the date of repayment thereof) at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.
 
(b)   Subject to the provisions of Section 2.07, the Revolving Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin.
 
(c)   Interest on each Revolving Loan shall be payable on the Interest Payment Dates applicable to such Revolving Loan except as otherwise provided in this Agreement; provided that (i) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Revolving Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (ii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Revolving Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate for each Interest Period or day within an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
SECTION 2.07.  Default Interest.  All past due amounts owing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall bear interest (after as well as before judgment) for all past-due periods, payable on demand, (a) in the case of principal, at the rate otherwise applicable to such Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.06 plus 2.00% per annum and (b) in all other cases, at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, when determined by reference to the Prime Rate and over a year of 360 days at all other times) equal to the rate that would be applicable to an ABR Revolving Loan plus 2.00% per annum.
 
SECTION 2.08.  Alternate Rate of Interest.  In the event, and on each occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing the Administrative Agent shall have determined that Dollar deposits in the principal amounts of the Revolving Loans comprising such Borrowing are not generally available in the London interbank market, or that the rates at which such Dollar deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the majority of Lenders of making or maintaining Eurodollar Revolving Loans during such Interest Period, or that reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, give written or fax notice of such determination to the Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any such determination, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.10 shall be deemed to be a request for an ABR Borrowing.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent under this Section 2.08 shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
33





 
SECTION 2.09.  Termination of Revolving Credit Commitments.  (a)  Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Credit Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
 
(b)   The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Credit Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $1,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans, the aggregate Revolving Loans would exceed the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments.
 
(c)   The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section 2.09 at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.09 shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit E (or such other form as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent) and shall be irrevocable, provided that a notice of termination delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of other Indebtedness or the occurrence of some other identifiable event or condition, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date of termination) if such condition is not satisfied.  Any termination or reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be permanent.  Each reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments.
 
SECTION 2.10.  Conversion and Continuation of Borrowings.  The Borrower shall have the right at any time upon prior irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent (a) not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the same Business Day as the day of conversion, to convert any Eurodollar Borrowing into an ABR Borrowing, (b) not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days prior to conversion or continuation, to convert any ABR Borrowing into a Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue any Eurodollar Borrowing as a Eurodollar Borrowing for an additional Interest Period, and (c) not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days prior to conversion, to convert the Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing to another permissible Interest Period, subject in each case to the following:

(ii) each conversion or continuation shall be made pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the Revolving Loans comprising the converted or continued Borrowing;

34





 
specified in Sections 2.02(a) and 2.02(b) regarding the principal amount and maximum number of Borrowings of the relevant Type;
 
(iv) each conversion shall be effected by each Lender and the Administrative Agent by recording for the account of such Lender the new Revolving Loan of such Lender resulting from such conversion and reducing the Revolving Loan (or portion thereof) of such Lender being converted by an equivalent principal amount; accrued interest on any Eurodollar Revolving Loan (or portion thereof) being converted shall be paid by the Borrower at the time of conversion;
 
(v) if any Eurodollar Borrowing is converted at a time other than the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall pay, upon demand, any amounts due to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.16;
 
(vi) any portion of a Borrowing maturing or required to be repaid in less than one month may not be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing;
 
(vii) any portion of a Eurodollar Borrowing that cannot be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing by reason of the immediately preceding clause shall be automatically converted at the end of the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing into an ABR Borrowing;
 
(viii) Reserved; and
 
(ix) upon notice to the Borrower from the Administrative Agent given at the request of the Required Lenders, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, no outstanding Revolving Loan may be converted into, or continued as, a Eurodollar Revolving Loan.
 
Each notice pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be in writing, substantially in the form of Exhibit D (or such other form as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent), and irrevocable and shall refer to this Agreement and specify (i) the identity and amount of the Borrowing that the Borrower requests be converted or continued, (ii) whether such Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing, (iii) if such notice requests a conversion, the date of such conversion (which shall be a Business Day) and (iv) if such Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto. If no Interest Period is specified in any such notice with respect to any conversion to or continuation as a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration. The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.10 and of each Lenders portion of any converted or continued Borrowing. If the Borrower shall not have given notice in accordance with this Section 2.10 to continue any Borrowing into a subsequent Interest Period (and shall not otherwise have given notice in accordance with this Section 2.10 to convert such Borrowing), such Borrowing shall, at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto (unless repaid pursuant to the terms hereof), automatically be converted into an ABR Borrowing.
 
SECTION 2.11.  Mandatory Prepayment of Borrowings.  In the event and on each occasion that the aggregate Revolving Loans exceed the aggregate Revolving Credit
 
35





 
Commitments, the Borrower shall prepay Borrowings in an aggregate amount necessary to eliminate such excess together with any fees required pursuant to Section 2.16.  Each notice pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be in writing, substantially in the form of Exhibit E, or such other form as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent.
 
SECTION 2.12.  Voluntary Prepayment.  Subject to Section 2.16, the Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in part, upon at least three Business Days prior written or fax notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written or fax notice) in the case of Eurodollar Revolving Loans, or written or fax notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written or fax notice) on the same Business Day of the date of prepayment in the case of ABR Revolving Loans, to the Administrative Agent before 11:00 a.m., New York City time; provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount that is not less than $5,000,000.  Each notice pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be in writing, substantially in the form of Exhibit E, or such other form as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent.
 
SECTION 2.13.  Reserved.
 
SECTION 2.14.  Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances.  (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Change in Law shall:
 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement which is reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate);
 
(ii) subject any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any Eurodollar Revolving Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes indemnified pursuant to Section 2.20 and the imposition of any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender); or
 
(iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Revolving Loans made by such Lender;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Eurodollar Revolving Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Revolving Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b)   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a
 
36





 
consequence of this Agreement, the Revolving Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c)   A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
(d)   Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than three months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the three-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).  The protection of this Section shall be available to each Lender regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the Change in Law that shall have occurred or been imposed.
 
SECTION 2.15.  Change in Legality.  (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Revolving Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Revolving Loan, then, by written notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent:
 
(i) such Lender may declare that Eurodollar Revolving Loans will not thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness) be made by such Lender hereunder (or be continued for additional Interest Periods) and ABR Revolving Loans will not thereafter (for such duration) be converted into Eurodollar Revolving Loans, whereupon any request for a Eurodollar Borrowing (or to convert an ABR Borrowing to a Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue a Eurodollar Borrowing for an additional Interest Period) shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR Revolving Loan (or a request to continue an ABR Revolving Loan as such for an additional Interest Period or to convert a Eurodollar Revolving Loan into an ABR Revolving Loan, as the case may be), unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and
 
(ii) such Lender may require that all outstanding Eurodollar Revolving Loans made by it be converted to ABR Revolving Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Revolving Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Revolving Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.
 
37





 
In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Revolving Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted Eurodollar Revolving Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the ABR Revolving Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Revolving Loans.
 
(b)   For purposes of this Section 2.15, a notice to the Borrower by any Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Revolving Loan made by such Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period then applicable to such Eurodollar Revolving Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Borrower.
 
SECTION 2.16.  Breakage.  The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss or expense (but not loss of profits) that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) any event, other than a default by such Lender in the performance of its obligations hereunder, which results in (i) such Lender receiving or being deemed to receive any amount on account of the principal of any Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Interest Period in effect therefor, (ii) the conversion of any Eurodollar Revolving Loan to an ABR Revolving Loan, or the conversion of the Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Revolving Loan, in each case other than on the last day of the Interest Period in effect therefor, or (iii) any Eurodollar Revolving Loan to be made by such Lender (including any Eurodollar Revolving Loan to be made pursuant to a conversion or continuation under Section 2.10) not being made after notice of such Revolving Loan shall have been given by the Borrower hereunder (any of the events referred to in this clause (a) being called a Breakage Event) or (b) any default in the making of any prepayment required to be made hereunder after notice of such prepayment has been delivered by the Borrower. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts which such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
SECTION 2.17.  Pro Rata Treatment.  Except as required under Section 2.15 and 2.23, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Revolving Loans, each reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments and each conversion of any Borrowing to or continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments (or, if such Revolving Credit Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Revolving Loans).  Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lenders portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lenders percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole Dollar amount.
 
SECTION 2.18.  Sharing of Setoffs.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and such
 
38





 
other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and other amounts owing them; provided that, (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement, or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Revolving Loans to any assignee or participant, other than Intermediate Holdings or any subsidiary thereof.  Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
 
SECTION 2.19.  Payments.  (a)  The Borrower shall make each payment (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing, any Administrative Agent Fees or other amounts) hereunder and under any other Loan Document not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date when due in immediately available Dollars, without setoff, defense or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. Each such payment shall be made to the Administrative Agent to its account in New York, New York as the Administrative Agent may designate.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender any payments received by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender.
 
(b)   Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Administrative Agent Fees or other amounts) hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or Administrative Agent Fees, if applicable.
 
(c)   If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal and interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties.
 
SECTION 2.20.  Taxes.  (a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes; provided that, if any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) shall be required to be deducted or withheld from such payments, then (i) the sum payable by the Borrower or any other Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions or withholdings (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the
 
39





 
Administrative Agent, each Lender or other recipient of such payment, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) the Borrower or such Loan Party shall make such deductions or withholdings and (iii) the Borrower or such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
(b)   Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
(c)   The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or by the Administrative Agent on behalf of itself or a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(d)   As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower or any other Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(e)   Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law and reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Foreign Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter promptly upon the expiration, obsolescence or invalidity of any previously delivered form or information or upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but in
 
40





 
each case only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(i) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States of America is a party and such W-8BEN shall establish (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty,

(iii) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8EXP,
 
(iv) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-IMY, together with any required attachments,
 
(v) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 871(h) or section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit J-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10-percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate), and (y) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN,
 
(vi) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit J-2 or Exhibit J-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit J-4 on behalf of each such direct or indirect partner, or
 
(vii) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation or information necessary to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
 
(f)   Any Lender that is not a Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter promptly upon the expiration, obsolescence or invalidity of any previously delivered form or information or upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, update such form or information or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so) duly completed
 
41





 
copies of IRS Form W-9 or other forms or information establishing an exemption from U.S. backup withholding.
 
(g)   If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document hereunder may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax under FATCA, such Lender shall deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent to comply with its withholding obligations, to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this Section 2.20(g), the term FATCA shall include any amendments to FATCA after the date hereof.
 
(h)   If a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.20, it shall pay to the relevant Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by a Loan Party under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the relevant Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the relevant Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Lender in the event the such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
 
SECTION 2.21.  Assignment of Revolving Loans Under Certain Circumstances; Duty to Mitigate.  (a)  If any Lender delivers a certificate requesting compensation pursuant to Section 2.14 or any Lender delivers a notice described in Section 2.15, the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority on account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.20, and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.21(b), or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:
 
(i) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 9.04;
 
42





 
(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Revolving Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Sections 2.14 and 2.16) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
 
(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting in such Lenders claim for compensation under Section 2.14, notice under Section 2.15 or the amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.20, as the case may be, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation, consequences or payments thereafter;
 
(iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law; and
 
(v) in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.
 
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
 
(b)   If any Lender shall request compensation under Section 2.14, any Lender delivers a notice described in Section 2.15 or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority on account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.20, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Revolving Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would reduce its claims for compensation under Section 2.14 or enable it to withdraw its notice pursuant to Section 2.15 or would reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.20, as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
SECTION 2.22.  Reserved.
 
SECTION 2.23.  Defaulting Lenders.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
 
(a)   Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 9.08.
 
(b)   Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or
 
43





 
mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VII or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.06), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Revolving Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, in the case of a Lender, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Revolving Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Revolving Loans and such Lender is a Defaulting Lender under clause (a) of the definition thereof, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the relevant Revolving Loans of the relevant non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied pursuant to this Section 2.23(b).  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 
(c)   Such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive or accrue any commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.05(c) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
 
(d)   If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Revolving Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders, whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.

Each Loan Party acknowledges that it may be obligated to notify relevant Governmental Authorities regarding the results of any observation, test or investigation disclosed to such Loan Party, and that such reporting

In addition, from time to time, the Borrower will, at its cost and expense, promptly secure the Obligations by pledging or creating, or causing to be pledged or created, perfected security interests with respect to such of the Loan Parties assets and properties as the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders shall reasonably request (it being understood that it is the intent of the parties that the Obligations shall be secured by substantially all the assets of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors (including real and other properties purchased or otherwise acquired subsequent to the Closing Date, but subject to the exclusions in the last sentence of this Section 5.12)). Such security interests and Liens will be created under the Security Documents and other security agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust and other instruments and documents reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Trustee, and the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Lenders all such customary instruments and documents (including legal opinions, title insurance policies, surveys, flood certificates, and Lien searches) as the Collateral Trustee shall reasonably request in connection with the execution of any Security Documents (and consistent with the requirements with respect to such Security Documents) to evidence compliance with this Section; it being understood that instruments and documents of the type delivered in connection with the initial Mortgaged Properties shall also be delivered in connection with Mortgaged Properties designated pursuant to this Section. The Borrower agrees to provide such evidence as the Collateral Trustee shall reasonably request as to the perfection and priority status of each such security interest and Lien.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.12 shall not apply to (and the applicable Loan Parties shall not be required to grant security interests in or provide Liens on or provide any of the related documents set forth herein with respect to) (x) any owned real property (inclusive of any Project thereon) the value (determined in good faith by the Borrower) of which is equal to or less than $25,000,000 and any other real property interest that is not owned or (y) any Excluded Assets, and the Loan Parties shall not be required to take any action with respect to any thereof.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.12, no Mortgage encumbering real property located in state of New York shall be required to secure any Hedging Obligations or any revolving credit facilities including the Loans hereunder.

ARTICLE VIII
 
The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee; Etc.
 
Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee (for purposes of this Article VIII, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee are referred to collectively as the Agents) to act on its behalf as the Agents hereunder and under the Loan Documents and authorizes the Agents to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together
 
82





 
with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent or Collateral Trustee, as applicable, is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agents are hereby expressly authorized to (i) execute any and all documents (including releases) with respect to the Collateral and the rights of the Secured Parties with respect thereto, as contemplated by and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Security Documents and (ii) negotiate, enforce or the settle any claim, action or proceeding affecting the Lenders in their capacity as such, at the direction of the Required Lenders, which negotiation, enforcement or settlement will be binding upon each Lender.
 
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Trustee hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as an Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with Intermediate Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
Neither Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) neither Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) neither Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that such Agent is instructed in writing to exercise by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that neither Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, neither Agent shall have any duty to disclose, nor shall it be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Intermediate Holdings, the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Trustee or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. Neither Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Article VII or Section 9.08) or in the absence
 
83





 
of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final non-appealable judgment. Neither Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by Intermediate Holdings, the Borrower or a Lender.  Neither Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein and therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent.
 
Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  Each Agent may also rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Revolving Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the reasonable satisfaction of a Lender, each Agent may presume that such condition is reasonably satisfactory to such Lender unless such Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Revolving Loan.  Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
Each Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it.  Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities as Agent.  Neither Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that such Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
 
Each Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Trustee, as the case may be, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in New York, New York.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation
 
84





 
(or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above.  Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.  If the Person serving as Agent is a Defaulting Lender, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Agent and, in consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Trustee, as the case may be.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Removal Effective Date), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.  With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (a) the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by such Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Agent is appointed) and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through such Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above.  Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as an Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent, and the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring or removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Agent was acting as Agent.
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any provision of any other Loan Document, each of the Joint Lead Arrangers listed on the cover page hereof shall not have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Trustee or a Lender hereunder; it being understood and agreed that each of the Joint Lead Arrangers shall be entitled to all indemnification and reimbursement rights in favor of the Agents provided herein and in the other Loan Documents.  Without limitation of the foregoing, the Joint Lead Arrangers
 
85





 
in their respective capacities as such shall not, by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, have any fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender, Loan Party or any other Person.
 
In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, each Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Revolving Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether such Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Revolving Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Agents (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Agents and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and Agents under Section 9.05) allowed in such judicial proceeding and (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same and, in either case, any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to such Agent and, in the event that such Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to such Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due such Agent under Section 9.05.
 
The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to instruct Collateral Trustee, in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, (a) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Collateral Trustee under any Loan Document (i) upon payment in full of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations), (ii) that is sold or otherwise disposed of or to be sold or otherwise disposed of as part of or in connection with any sale or other disposition permitted under the Loan Documents, or (iii) subject to Section 9.08, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, (b) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Collateral Trustee under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Sections 6.02(a), (h), (r), (s) and (t), and (c) to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents.  Upon request by the Collateral Trustee at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Collateral Trustees authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement pursuant to this Article VIII.  The Collateral Trustee shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Collateral Trustees Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Collateral Trustee be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.
 
86





 
To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  If any payment has been made to any Lender by the Administrative Agent without the applicable withholding Tax being withheld from such payment and the Administrative Agent has paid over the applicable withholding Tax to the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority, or the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective or for any other reason, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred.

88





 
Administrative Agent or any Lender by means of electronic communications pursuant to this Section, including through the Platform.
 
The Borrower hereby acknowledges that (a) the Administrative Agent will make available to the Lenders materials and/or information provided by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder (collectively, the Borrower Materials) by posting the Borrower Materials on the Platform and (b) certain of the Lenders may be public-side Lenders (i.e., Lenders that do not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities) (each, a Public Lender). The Borrower hereby agrees that (w) all Borrower Materials that are to be made available to Public Lenders shall be clearly and conspicuously marked PUBLIC which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word PUBLIC shall appear prominently on the first page thereof; (x) by marking Borrower Materials PUBLIC, the Borrower shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to treat such Borrower Materials as not containing any material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States federal and state securities laws (provided, however, that to the extent such Borrower Materials constitute Information, they shall be treated as set forth in Section 9.16); (y) all Borrower Materials marked PUBLIC are permitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform designated as Public Investor; and (z) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials that are not marked PUBLIC as being suitable only for posting on a portion of the Platform not marked as Public Investor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following Borrower Materials shall be marked PUBLIC, unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent promptly that any such document contains material non-public information:  (1) the Loan Documents and (2) notification of changes in the terms of the Credit Facilities.
 
Each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the Private Side Information or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lenders compliance procedures and applicable law, including United States Federal and state securities laws, to make reference to Communications that are not made available through the Public Side Information portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws.
 
Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to give any notice or other communication pursuant to any Loan Document in any other manner specified in such Loan Document.
 
SECTION 9.02.  Survival of Agreement.  All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower or Intermediate Holdings herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Lenders and shall survive the making by the Lenders of the Revolving Loans, regardless of any investigation made by the Lenders or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Revolving Loan or any Administrative Agent Fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid. The provisions of Sections 2.12, 2.14, 2.18, 9.05 and 9.16 shall remain operative and in
 
89





 
full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Revolving Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Trustee or any Lender; provided that, with respect to any Lender or any Participant, Section 9.16 shall remain operative and in full force and effect for a period one year following the repayment in full of such Persons Revolving Loans.
 
SECTION 9.03.  Binding Effect.  Except as provided in Article IV, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.
 
SECTION 9.04.  Successors and Assigns.  (a)  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Agent and each Lender and any such attempted transfer or assignment shall be null and void, and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of paragraph (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Joint Lead Arrangers and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
(b)   Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
 
(i) (A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders principal outstanding balance of the Revolving Loans or contemporaneous assignments to Permitted Affiliate Assignees that equal at least the amount specified in paragraph (b)(i)(B) of this Section in the aggregate or in the case of an assignment to a Permitted Affiliate Assignee, no minimum amount need be assigned and (B) in any case not described in paragraph (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the principal outstanding balance of the Revolving Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of Revolving Loans, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably
 
90





 
withheld or delayed); provided that the consent of the Borrower pursuant to this clause (i)(B) shall be deemed to be given if the Borrower does not consent to or reject such assignment within 10 days of receipt of notice thereof.
 
(ii) Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Revolving Loans assigned.
 
(iii) No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by paragraph (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition, the consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (in each case, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) shall be required for assignments in respect of any Revolving Loans to a Person who is not a Permitted Affiliate Assignee.
 
(iv) The parties to each assignment shall (A) execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent or (B) if previously agreed with the Administrative Agent, manually execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, in each case, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive or reduce such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment.  The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire and all applicable tax forms.
 
(v) No such assignment shall be made to any Disqualified Lender; provided that no Agent shall have any liability or responsibility to monitor, police or control any assignments to Disqualified Lenders.
 
(vi) No such assignment shall be made to (A) a natural Person, or (B) the Borrower or any of its Affiliates.
 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.16, 2.20 and 9.05 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (f) of this Section.

(c)   By executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption, the assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows:  (i) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and that the outstanding balances of its Revolving Loans without giving effect to assignments thereof which have not become effective, are as set forth in such Assignment and Assumption, (ii) except as set forth in (i) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement, or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto, or the financial condition of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the performance or observance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any of its obligations under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto, (iii) such assignee represents and warrants that it is an Eligible Assignee legally authorized to enter into such Assignment and Assumption, (iv) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial statements referred to in Section 3.05(a) or delivered pursuant to Section 5.04 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Assumption, (v) such assignee will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Trustee, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement, (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee, respectively, by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.
 
(d)   The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the principal amounts of and stated interest on the Revolving Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(e)   Upon its receipt of, and consent to, a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, an Administrative Questionnaire completed in respect of the assignee (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) above,
 
92





 
if applicable, and the written consent of the Administrative Agent to such assignment and any applicable tax forms or other documentation, the Administrative Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment and Assumption and (ii) promptly record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph (e).
 
(f)   Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of the Revolving Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Borrower, the Agents and Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 9.05(c) with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s).  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver decreasing any fees payable to such Participant or the amount of principal of or the rate at which interest is payable on the Revolving Loans in which such Participant has an interest, extending any scheduled principal payment date or date fixed for the payment of interest on the Revolving Loans in which such Participant has an interest or releasing all or substantially all of the value of the Guarantees provided by the Subsidiary Guarantors (other than in connection with the sale of the respective Subsidiary Guarantors in a transaction permitted by Section 6.05) or releasing all or substantially all of the Collateral.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall, subject to the last sentence of this clause (f), be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.16 and 2.20 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.21 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.06 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Sections 2.18 and 9.17 as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Revolving Loans or other rights or obligations under the Loan Documents (each such register, a Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of any Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Revolving Loans or other rights or obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Revolving Loan or other right or obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations.  The entries in a Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall
 
93





 
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.14, 2.16 and 2.20 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.20 to the extent such Participant fails to comply with Section 2.20(e) and (f) as though it were a Lender.
 
(g)   Any Lender or participant may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.04, disclose to the respective permitted assignee or participant or proposed permitted assignee or participant any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure of information designated by the Borrower as confidential, each such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall execute an agreement whereby such assignee or participant shall agree (subject to customary exceptions) to preserve the confidentiality of such confidential information on terms no less restrictive than those applicable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.16.
 
(h)   Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(i)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a Granting Lender) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an SPV), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Revolving Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any Revolving Loan and (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Revolving Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Revolving Loan pursuant to the terms hereof.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender).  In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under Debtor Relief Law.  In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.04, any SPV may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Revolving Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and Administrative
 
94





 
Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPV to support the funding or maintenance of Revolving Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Revolving Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPV.
 
SECTION 9.05.  Expenses; Indemnity.  (a)  The Borrower and Intermediate Holdings shall pay, jointly and severally, (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers and their Affiliates (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Agents and of a single local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction) in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) and (ii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents and any Lender (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers or any Lender) in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights (A) in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or (B) in connection with the Revolving Loans made hereunder, including all such reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Revolving Loans.
 
(b)   The Borrower and Intermediate Holdings shall indemnify, jointly and severally, each Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Joint Lead Arranger, each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one firm of counsel for any Indemnitee and, if necessary, one firm of local counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction), and shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee from all fees and time charges and disbursements, incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any Person (including the Borrower or any other Loan Party) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) any Revolving Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or Release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (except to the extent such Release occurs solely following foreclosure upon such property and is not caused by or does not otherwise arise out of any action or inaction by any Loan Party), or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower or any other Loan Party, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable
 
95





 
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) are owed with respect to disputes between and among Indemnitees (other than disputes against any Indemnitee in its capacity, or in fulfilling its role as, an administrative agent or arranger (or against any other Indemnitee acting in its capacity as affiliate, officer, director or employee for such administrative agent or arranger acting in such capacity or role), or any similar role under the Credit Facilities).
 
If for any reason the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to an Indemnitee or insufficient to hold it harmless, then the Borrower and Intermediate Holdings will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnitee as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative economic interests of (i) the Borrower and Intermediate Holdings and their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, shareholders, partners, members or other equity holders on the one hand and (ii) the Indemnitee on the other hand in the matters contemplated by the Transactions as well as the relative fault of (x) the Borrower and Intermediate Holdings and their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, shareholders, partners, members or other equity holders on the one hand and (y) the Indemnitee with respect to such loss, claim, damage or liability and any other relevant equitable considerations.  The indemnity and contribution obligations of the Borrower and Intermediate Holdings under this paragraph will be in addition to any liability which the Borrower and Intermediate Holdings may otherwise have and will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors and assigns of the Borrower and Intermediate Holdings, the Indemnitees, any such Subsidiaries and any such Affiliates.
 
(c)   To the extent that Intermediate Holdings and the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to any Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), any Joint Lead Arranger or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent (or any such sub-agent) such Joint Lead Arranger or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought based on each Lenders share of the Revolving Loans at such time) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid amount in respect of a claim asserted by such Lender); provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against such Agent (or any such sub-agent) such Joint Lead Arranger in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for such Agent (or any such sub-agent) such Joint Lead Arranger in connection with such capacity.  For purposes hereof, a Lenders pro rata share shall be determined based upon its share of the outstanding Revolving Credit Commitments at the time.
 
(d)   To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no party hereto shall assert, and each party hereto hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee or Loan Party, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Revolving Loan, or the use of the proceeds thereof; provided that such waiver shall not include or affect in any way the obligations of the Borrower and Intermediate Holdings to indemnify the Indemnitees as set forth in this Section
 
96





 
9.05.  No Indemnitee referred to in paragraph (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
 
(e)   Each partys obligations under this Section shall survive the termination of the Loan Documents and payment of the obligations hereunder.  All amounts due under this Section shall be payable within 10 Business Days after demand therefor.
 
SECTION 9.06.  Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, each Person of which such Lender is a subsidiary, each Person which is a subsidiary of such Lender and such Person and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Lender Party) are, in each case, hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held, and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing, by such Lender Party, to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or Intermediate Holdings against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower or Intermediate Holdings now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender Party, irrespective of whether or not such Lender Party shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower or Intermediate Holdings may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender Party different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness.  The rights of each Lender Party under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender Party may have.  Each Lender Party agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.
 
SECTION 9.07.  Applicable Law.  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND ANY CLAIMS, CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE) BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (EXCEPT, AS TO ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH THEREIN) AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
 
SECTION 9.08.  Waivers; Amendment.  (a)  No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Trustee or any Lender in exercising any power or right hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Trustee and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower or any
 
97





 
other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  No notice or demand on the Borrower or Intermediate Holdings in any case shall entitle the Borrower or Intermediate Holdings to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
 
(b)   Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower, Intermediate Holdings and the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such agreement shall (i) extend or increase the Revolving Credit Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) postpone any date scheduled for any payment of principal or interest, waive or excuse the payment thereof (in part or in whole), or decrease the rate of interest on any Revolving Loan, without the prior written consent of each Lender directly adversely affected thereby, (iii) increase or extend the Revolving Loans or decrease or extend the date for payment of any fees of any Lender without the prior written consent of such Lender, (iv) amend or modify the pro rata requirements of Section 2.17, the provisions of Section 9.04(a) or the provisions of this Section or release all or substantially all of the value of the Guarantees provided by the Subsidiary Guarantor (other than in connection with the sale of such Subsidiary Guarantor in a transaction permitted by Section 6.05) or releasing all or substantially all of the Collateral, without the prior written consent of each Lender, (v) modify the protections afforded to an SPV pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.04(i) without the written consent of such SPV, (vi) amend or modify the definition of the terms Required Lenders or Supermajority Lenders without the prior written consent of each Lender (it being understood that with the consent of the Required Lenders, additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the determination of the Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Revolving Credit Commitments on the date hereof); provided, further, however, that no such agreement shall (w) amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee or hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee, (x) waive, amend or modify the provisions of Sections 6.01, 6.02, 6.06, 6.07, 6.09(a)(ii), (y) amend or modify the provisions of paragraph (n) of Article VII or the definitions of Change of Control, Equity Interests, Parent, Pledge Agreement or Intercreditor Agreement or (z) amend or modify the first priority ranking (subject to Liens permitted by Section 6.02) of the Liens on, and security interest in, the Collateral, in the case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), without the prior written consent of the Supermajority Lenders.
 
(c)   The Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend any Loan Document to correct administrative errors or omissions, or to effect administrative changes that are not adverse to any Lender.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, such amendment shall become effective without any further consent of any other party to such Loan Document.
 
SECTION 9.09.  Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Revolving Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Revolving Loan under
 
98





 
applicable law (collectively the Charges), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Revolving Loan or participation in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Revolving Loan or participation hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Revolving Loan or participation but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section 9.09 shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Revolving Loans or participations or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.
 
SECTION 9.10.  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  Any other previous agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof is superseded by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Nothing in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto and thereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereunder and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Trustee and the Lenders) any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.
 
SECTION 9.11.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11.
 
SECTION 9.12.  Severabili

self and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the County and City of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the Transactions, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, litigation or proceeding may be heard only and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such Federal court.  Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.  Nothing in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against the Borrower or any other Loan Party or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
 
(b)   The Borrower and each other Loan Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section.  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
 
100





 
(c)   Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01.  Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable law.
 
SECTION 9.16.  Confidentiality.  Each of the Agents and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners); (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any other party hereto; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as (or no less restrictive than) those of this Section, to (i) any permitted assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective permitted assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder; (g) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers with respect to the Credit Facilities; (h) with the consent of the Borrower; or (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section, or (y) becomes available to any Agent, any Lender, or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower.  For the purposes of this Section, Information shall mean all information received from Intermediate Holdings, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries relating to Intermediate Holdings, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; provided that, in the case of information received from Intermediate Holdings, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
 
SECTION 9.17.  Lender Action.  Each Lender agrees that it shall not take or institute any actions or proceedings, judicial or otherwise, for any right or remedy pursuant to any of the Loan Documents against any Loan Party or any other obligor under any of the Loan Documents (including rights on account of any bankers lien or similar claim or other rights of self-help (other than any such right afforded by Section 9.06 hereof)), or institute any actions or proceedings, or otherwise commence any remedial procedures, with respect to any Collateral or any other property of any such Loan Party in connection with any of the Loan Documents, unless expressly provided for herein (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 9.06 hereof) or
 
101





 
in any other Loan Document, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.  The provisions of this Section 9.17 are for the sole benefit of the Lenders and shall not afford any right to, or constitute a defense available to, any Loan Party.
 
SECTION 9.18.  USA PATRIOT Act Notice.  Each Lender and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies Intermediate Holdings and the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower and the other Loan Parties, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower and the other Loan Parties in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act.

LITIGATION
 
1.             GenOn Energy, Inc.  v. State Water Resources Control Board, No. 34-2010-80000701 (Cal. Super. Ct. Sacramento County).  Dynegy Moss Landing, LLC and Dynegy Morro Bay, LLC joined other electric generators in this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, challenging the State Water Resources Control Boards adoption of the Water Quality Control Policy on the Use of Coastal and Estuarine Waters for Power Plant Cooling (the OTC Policy).  The OTC Policy would require impingement mortality and entrainment reduction standards to be achieved by December 31, 2015 at Morro Bay and December 31, 2017 at Moss Landing.  Settlement negotiations are ongoing.  The court hearing on the petition is scheduled for June 21, 2013.
 
2.             In May 2012, Southern California Edison (SCE) notified Dynegy Morro Bay, LLC  and Dynegy Moss Landing, LLC that it was terminating certain energy and capacity contracts with those entities.  The validity of the purported terminations and subsequent actions by SCE are being disputed by Dynegy.

biological resources of the Bay are also necessary.  The South Bay Power Plant was retired at the end of 2010.  No further action was taken with respect to this Finding during the term of the permit.  If, in the future, Dynegy South Bay, LLC is held responsible for remediation/ restoration/rehabilitation of the Bay or the discharge channel, responsibility would likely be shared with the South Bay Power Plants prior owners/operators, as well as other sources that have contributed to any damage/detrimental impacts.

SCHEDULE 6.10(a)
 
PERMITTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
 
Capital Expenditures made in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2013, commencing from the Closing Date, in an amount not to exceed approximately $117 million.
 





 
SCHEDULE 6.10(d)
 
ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
AND PROPOSED LEGISLATION
 
1.     Greenhouse Gases (GHG)
 
A.    Federal
 
a.       Federal Legislation.  Since 2003 several bills have been introduced in Congress that, if passed, would compel reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) and/or GHG emissions from power plants.  Future enactment of federal legislation requiring CO2 and/or GHG emission reductions from power plants remains possible.
 
b.     Federal Regulation.
 
(i) Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD).  On June 3, 2010 (75  Fed. Reg. 31514), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule to phase in new 

   Cooling Water Intake Structures.  On April 20, 2011 (76 Fed. Reg. 22174), the EPA issued a proposed rule under Clean Water Act section 316(b) for cooling water intake structures at existing facilities.  The proposed rule would establish impingement mortality and entrainment standards and related requirements.  Under a settlement agreement, as amended, the EPA will finalize the rule by June 27, 2013.
 
8.             NSPS for Stationary Gas Turbines and Stationary Combustion Turbines.   On August 29, 2012 (77 Fed. Reg. 52554), the EPA issued proposed revisions to the standards of performance for new, modified and reconstructed stationary gas turbines and combustion turbines, 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subparts GG and KKKK.
 
9.             The EPA has proposed Guidance Regarding Identification of Waters Protected by the Clean Water Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 24479 (May 2, 2011).  While adoption of the guidance would not itself impose any new material environmental burdens on Dynegy Gas Investments Holdings, LLCs or its subsidiaries facilities, it may result in our facilities becoming subject to Corps of Engineers and/or state regulatory requirements.
 
10.          Industrial Boiler Hazardous Air Pollutant Emission Standards.  In March 2011, the EPA issued emission standards to control hazardous air pollutants from new and existing industrial, commercial and institutional boilers, 40 C.F.R. Part 63, Subparts JJJJJJ (area sources) and DDDDD (major sources).  On December 20, 2012, the EPA finalized revisions to these boiler hazardous air pollutant standards.  Existing boilers at major sources generally have until early 2016 to comply.  Existing boilers at area sources generally have until March 2014 to comply.
 
11.          California NPDES General Permit for Discharge of Storm Water Associated with Industrial Activities.  On July 18, 2012, the Water Board released for public comment the 2012 Draft NPDES General Permit for Discharge of Storm Water Associated with Industrial Activities, which would revise the 1997 version of this general permit.  The Water Board expects to adopt the revised general permit in 2013.
 
12.          Without limitation, any federal, state, local or regional legislation or regulation related to or arising out of any one of items 1-11 above that becomes any Environmental Law.

FORM OF AFFILIATE SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT
of
DYNEGY POWER, LLC
 
AFFILIATE SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT, dated as of [                ], 20[    ] (this Agreement), among the subordinated lenders listed on Schedule 1 hereto (each a Subordinated Lender and collectively, the Subordinated Lenders), DYNEGY POWER, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Borrower), and each Subsidiary listed on Schedule 2 hereto (together with the Borrower, each a Subordinated Borrower and collectively, the Subordinated Borrowers) and ROYAL BANK OF CANADA, in its capacity as Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement for the benefit of the Lenders (each as defined below).
 
Reference is made to the Credit Agreement dated as of January 16, 2013 (as may be amended, restated, replaced, refinanced, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement; capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement), among the Borrower, DYNEGY GAS INVESTMENTS HOLDINGS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders) and ROYAL BANK OF CANADA, as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, including any successor thereto, the Administrative Agent), and the other banks, other financial institutions and entities party thereto from time to time.
 
All references to articles, sections, exhibits and schedules shall be deemed references to articles and sections of, and exhibits and schedules to, this Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise require.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender or Secured Party shall be deemed to be an Affiliate of any Credit Party or of any Subsidiary of any Credit Party solely by reason of the provisions of the Loan Documents.
 
The ability under the Credit Agreement of any Subordinated Borrower to incur Indebtedness to any Subordinated Lender is conditioned upon the execution and delivery by such Subordinated Lender and each Subordinated Borrower of an agreement in the form hereof pursuant to which such Subordinated Lender agrees to subordinate its rights with respect to the Subordinated Obligations (as defined below) to the rights of the Senior Lenders (as defined below) under the Credit Agreement, all on the terms set forth herein.
 
Accordingly, each Subordinated Lender, each Subordinated Borrower and the Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself and each other Secured Party (each, as defined in the Credit Agreement and together with each of their respective successors or assigns, collectively, the Senior Lenders), hereby agrees as follows:
 
SECTION 1.                            Subordination.  (a)  Each Subordinated Lender hereby agrees that all its right, title and interest in and to the Subordinated Obligations shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the rights of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and each other Senior Lender in respect of the Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement, the Senior Obligations).  For purposes hereof, Subordinated Obligations means all
 
G-1





 
obligations of each Subordinated Borrower to each Subordinated Lender in respect of loans, advances, extensions of credit or other Indebtedness, including in respect of principal, premium (if any), interest (including interest accruing after the maturity of the Revolving Loans and interest accruing after the filing of any petition in bankruptcy, or the commencement of any insolvency, reorganization or like proceeding, whether or not a claim for post-filing or post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding), fees, charges, expenses, indemnities, reimbursement obligations and other amounts payable in respect thereof.
 
(b)                                 Each Subordinated Borrower and each Subordinated Lender agrees (in each case solely with respect to the Subordinated Obligations in respect of which it is the obligor or obligee, as the case may be, and solely with respect to each Subordinated Borrower or Subordinated Lender that is its counterparty on such Subordinated Obligations) that no payment (whether directly, by purchase, redemption, exercise of any right of setoff or otherwise) in respect of the Subordinated Obligations, whether as principal, interest or otherwise, and whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made by or on behalf of any Subordinated Borrower to any Subordinated Lender not a Loan Party or received, accepted or demanded, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of any Subordinated Lender not a Loan Party at any time upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default.
 
(c)                                  Upon any distribution of the assets of any Subordinated Borrower or upon any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization of any Subordinated Borrower, whether in bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement or receivership proceedings or otherwise, or upon any assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of the assets and liabilities of any Subordinated Borrower, or otherwise (in each case except as permitted by the Credit Agreement):
 
(i)                                     the Senior Lenders shall first be entitled to receive unconditional, final and irrevocable payment in full in cash of the Senior Obligations (whenever arising) before any Subordinated Lender shall be entitled to receive any payment on account of the Subordinated Obligations of such Subordinated Borrower, whether of principal, interest, fees or otherwise; and
 
(ii)                                  any payment by, or on behalf of, or distribution of the assets of, such Subordinated Borrower of any kind or character on account of the Subordinated Obligations, whether in cash, securities, property or otherwise, to which any Subordinated Lender would be entitled except for the provisions of this Section 1 shall be paid or delivered by the Person making such payment or distribution (whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver, custodian, liquidating trustee or any other Person) directly to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Senior Lenders, payable in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, until the unconditional, final and irrevocable payment in full of all Senior Obligations.
 
(d)                                 Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Subordinated Lender (if not a Loan Party) agrees not to ask, demand, sue for or take or receive from any Subordinated Borrower, in cash, securities, property or otherwise, or by setoff, purchase, redemption (including, without limitation, from or by way of collateral) or otherwise, payment of all or any part of the Subordinated Obligations and agrees, upon the occurrence and
 
G-2





 
during the continuance of an Event of Default, that in connection with any proceeding involving any Subordinated Borrower under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, receivership or similar law (i) the Administrative Agent is irrevocably authorized and empowered (in its own name or in the name of such Subordinated Lender or otherwise), but shall have no obligation, to demand, sue for, collect and receive every payment or distribution referred to in the preceding sentence and give acquittance therefor and to file claims and proofs of claim and take such other action (including, without limitation, voting the applicable Subordinated Obligations and enforcing any security interest or other Lien securing payment of such Subordinated Obligations) as the Administrative Agent may deem reasonably necessary or advisable for the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights, remedies, benefits or interests of the Senior Lenders and (ii) such Subordinated Lender shall duly and promptly take such action as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to (A) collect amounts in respect of the applicable Subordinated Obligations for the account of the Senior Lenders and to file appropriate claims or proofs of claim in respect of such Subordinated Obligations, (B) execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent such irrevocable powers of attorney, assignments or other instruments as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in order to enable the Administrative Agent to enforce any and all claims with respect to, and any security interests and other Liens securing payment of, the applicable Subordinated Obligations and (C) collect and receive any and all payments or distributions which may be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to the applicable Subordinated Obligations.  A copy of this Agreement may be filed with any court as evidence of each Senior Lenders right, power and authority hereunder.
 
(e)                                  In the event that any payment by, or on behalf of, or distribution of the assets of, any Subordinated Borrower of any kind or character, whether in cash, securities, property or otherwise, and whether directly, by purchase, redemption, exercise of any right of setoff or otherwise, shall be received by or on behalf of any Subordinated Lender or any Affiliate thereof at a time when such payment is prohibited by this Agreement, such payment or distribution shall be held by such Subordinated Lender or Affiliate in trust (segregated from other property of such Subordinated Lender or Affiliate) for the benefit of, and shall forthwith be paid over to, the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Senior Lenders, payable in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, until the unconditional, final and irrevocable payment in full of all Senior Obligations.
 
(f)                                   Subject to the prior unconditional, final and irrevocable payment in full of all Senior Obligations, each applicable Subordinated Lender shall be subrogated to the rights of the Senior Lenders to receive payments or distributions in cash, securities, property or otherwise of each applicable Subordinated Borrower applicable to the Senior Obligations, and, as between and among a Subordinated Borrower, its creditors (other than the Senior Lenders) and the applicable Subordinated Lenders, no such payment or distribution made to the Senior Lenders by virtue of this Agreement that otherwise would have been made to any applicable Subordinated Lender shall be deemed to be a payment by the applicable Subordinated Borrower on account of the Subordinated Obligations, it being understood that the provisions of this Section 1(f) are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Subordinated Lenders and the Senior Lenders.
 
(g)                                  Without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, no Subordinated Borrower shall give, or permit to be given, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries
 
G-3





 
not to give or permit to be given, and no Subordinated Lender shall receive, accept or demand, (i) any security of any nature whatsoever for any Subordinated Obligations on any cash, securities, property or other assets, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, of any Subordinated Borrower or any subsidiary of any Subordinated Borrower, unless such security shall by its terms be subject to enforcement and collection by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee, as the case may be, in connection with any action in respect of enforcement or collection taken under Section 1(c) above or (ii) any Guarantee, of any nature whatsoever, by any Subordinated Borrower or any subsidiary of any Subordinated Borrower, of any Subordinated Obligations other than any Guarantee subordinated to the Senior Obligations on terms substantially identical to (and no less favorable in any significant respect to the Senior Lenders than) those hereof.  Each Subordinated Lender agrees that all the proceeds of any such security or Guarantee shall be subject to the provisions hereof with respect to payments and other distributions in respect of the Subordinated Obligations.
 
(h)                                 Each Subordinated Lender and each Subordinated Borrower agrees that all Subordinated Obligations, if evidenced by a promissory note, will be evidenced solely by a single promissory note in the form attached as Annex 1 to Exhibit F of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or, after the termination of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, in the form attached hereto as Annex 1 (unless and to the extent otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent), and that such promissory note and any and all instruments now or hereafter creating or evidencing the Subordinated Obligations, whether upon refunding, extension, renewal, refinancing, replacement or otherwise, shall, after the termination of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, contain the following legend:
 
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the principal of nor the interest on, nor any other amounts payable in respect of, the indebtedness created or evidenced by this instrument or record shall become due or be paid or payable, except to the extent permitted under the Affiliate Subordination Agreement, dated as of [                ], 20[    ], among the Subordinated Lenders, the Subordinated Borrowers and Royal Bank of Canada, in its capacity as Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement, which Affiliate Subordination Agreement is incorporated herein with the same effect as if fully set forth herein.
 
(i)                                     Each Subordinated Lender agrees that, except for claims submitted in any proceeding contemplated by Section 1(c), it will not take any action to cause any Subordinated Obligations to become payable prior to their scheduled maturity (which, in the case of any demand notes, shall be the date demand is made thereunder) or exercise any remedies or take any action or proceeding to enforce any Subordinated Obligation if the payment of such Subordinated Obligation is then prohibited by this Agreement, and each Subordinated Lender further agrees not to file, or to join with any other creditors of any Subordinated Borrower in filing, any petition commencing any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement or receivership proceeding or any assignment for the benefit of creditors against or in respect of such Subordinated Borrower or any other marshalling of the assets and liabilities of such Subordinated Borrower (provided that this prohibition shall in no event be construed so as to limit (x) any Subordinated Lenders right to cause any Subordinated Obligations to become payable prior to their scheduled maturity if all the outstanding Revolving Loans under the Credit
 
G-4





 
Agreement have been declared forthwith due and payable and all of the Revolving Credit Commitments terminated prior to their scheduled maturity date) or (y) any Subordinated Borrowers right to prepay any Subordinated Obligation if the respective prepayment is not otherwise prohibited at such time hereunder or under the Credit Agreement.  Each Subordinated Lender further agrees, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, that it will not cause any Subordinated Borrower to file any such petition, commence any such proceeding or make any such assignment referred to above until all Senior Obligations have been unconditionally and irrevocably paid in cash.
 
SECTION 2.                            Waivers and Consents.  (a)  Each Subordinated Lender waives the right to compel that the Collateral or any other assets or property of any Subordinated Borrower or any of its subsidiaries or the assets or property of any guarantor of the Senior Obligations or any other Person be applied in any particular order to discharge the Senior Obligations.  Each Subordinated Lender expressly waives the right to require the Senior Lenders to proceed against any Subordinated Borrower, any of its subsidiaries, the Collateral, any other assets or property of any Subordinated Borrower or any of its subsidiaries or any guarantor of the Senior Obligations or any other Person, or to pursue any other remedy in any Senior Lenders power which such Subordinated Lender cannot pursue and which would lighten such Subordinated Lenders burden, notwithstanding that the failure of any Senior Lender to do so may thereby prejudice such Subordinated Lender.  Each Subordinated Lender agrees that it shall not be discharged, exonerated or have its obligations hereunder to the Senior Lenders reduced by (i) any Senior Lenders delay in proceeding against or enforcing any remedy against any Subordinated Borrower, any of its subsidiaries, the Collateral or any other asset or property of any Subordinated Borrower or any of its subsidiaries or any guarantor of the Senior Obligations or any other Person, (ii) any Senior Lender releasing any Subordinated Borrower, any of its subsidiaries, the Collateral or any other asset or property of any Subordinated Borrower or any of its subsidiaries or any other guarantor of the Senior Obligations or any other Person from all or any part of the Senior Obligations or (iii) the discharge of any Subordinated Borrower, any of its subsidiaries, the Collateral or any other asset or property of any Subordinated Borrower or any of its subsidiaries or any guarantor of the Senior Obligations or any other Person by an operation of law or otherwise, with or without the intervention or omission of a Senior Lender.  Any Senior Lenders vote to accept or reject any plan of reorganization relating to any Subordinated Borrower, any of its subsidiaries, the Collateral or any other asset or property of any Subordinated Borrower or any of its subsidiaries or any guarantor of the Senior Obligations or any other Person, or any Senior Lenders receipt on account of the Senior Obligations, other than the unconditional, final and irrevocable payment in full in cash thereof, of any cash, securities, property or other assets distributed in any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or similar proceeding, shall not discharge, exonerate, or reduce the obligations of any Subordinated Lender hereunder to the Senior Lenders.
 
(b)                                 Each Subordinated Lender waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Senior Lenders, even though that election of remedies, including, without limitation, any non-judicial foreclosure with respect to security for the Senior Obligations, has impaired the value of such Subordinated Lenders rights of subrogation, reimbursement or contribution against any Subordinated Borrower or any other guarantor of the Senior Obligations or any other Person.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Subordinated Lender expressly waives any rights or defenses it may have by reason of protection
 
G-5





 
afforded to any Subordinated Borrower or any other guarantor of the Senior Obligations or any other Person with respect to the Senior Obligations pursuant to any anti-deficiency laws or other laws of similar import which limit or discharge the principal debtors indebtedness upon judicial or non-judicial foreclosure of real property or personal property Collateral for the Senior Obligations.
 
(c)                                  Each Subordinated Lender agrees that, without the necessity of any reservation of rights against it, and without notice to or further assent by it, any demand for payment of any Senior Obligations made by any Senior Lender may be rescinded in whole or in part by such Senior Lender, and any Senior Obligation may be continued, and the Senior Obligations, or the liability of the applicable Subordinated Borrower, any of its subsidiaries or any other guarantor or any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any Collateral or Guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, replaced, extended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered, or released by the Senior Lenders, in each case without notice to or further assent by any Subordinated Lender, which will remain bound under this Agreement and without impairing, abridging, releasing or affecting the subordination and other agreements of the Subordinated Lenders provided for herein.
 
(d)                                 Each Subordinated Lender waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Senior Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Senior Lenders upon this Agreement.  The Senior Obligations, and any of them, shall be deemed conclusively to have been created, contracted or incurred and the consent given to create the obligations of each Subordinated Borrower in respect of the Subordinated Obligations in reliance upon this Agreement, and all dealings between each Subordinated Borrower and the Senior Lenders shall be deemed to have been consummated in reliance upon this Agreement.  Each Subordinated Lender acknowledges and agrees that the Senior Lenders have relied upon the subordination and other agreements provided for herein in consenting to the Subordinated Obligations.  Each Subordinated Lender waives notice of or proof of reliance on this Agreement and protest, demand for payment and notice of default.
 
SECTION 3.                            Transfers.  Each Subordinated Lender shall not sell, assign or otherwise transfer or dispose of, in whole or in part, all or any part of the Subordinated Obligations or any interest therein to any other Person (a Transferee), other than another Subordinated Lender bound by the provisions of this Agreement, or create, incur or suffer to exist any security interest, Lien, charge or other encumbrance whatsoever upon all or any part of the Subordinated Obligations or any interest therein in favor of any Transferee (other than Permitted Liens) unless (a) such action is made expressly subject to this Agreement and (b) the Transferee, expressly acknowledges to the Administrative Agent, by a writing in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, the subordination and other agreements provided for herein and in such writing agrees to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, this Section 3, as if such Person were a Subordinated Lender.
 
SECTION 4.                            Senior Obligations Unconditional.  All rights and interests of the Senior Lenders hereunder, and all agreements and obligations of the Subordinated Lenders and the Subordinated Borrowers hereunder, shall remain in full force and effect irrespective of:
 
G-6





 
(a)                                 any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document;
 
(b)                                 any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Senior Obligations, or any amendment or waiver or other modification, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, of, or consent to departure from, the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document;
 
(c)                                  any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Lien in any Collateral, or any release, amendment, waiver or other modification, whether in writing or by course of conduct or otherwise, of, or consent to departure from, any Guarantee of any of the Senior Obligations; or
 
(d)                                 any other circumstances that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Subordinated Borrower, any of its subsidiaries, any guarantor of the Senior Obligations or any other Person in respect of the Senior Obligations, or of the Subordinated Lender, any Subordinated Borrower, any of its subsidiaries, any guarantor of the Senior Obligations or any other Person in respect of this Agreement (other than payment).
 
SECTION 5.                            Representations and Warranties.  Each Subordinated Lender represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Senior Lenders, that:
 
(a)                                 It has the power and authority to execute and deliver and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and has taken all necessary action to authorize its execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement.
 
(b)                                 This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Subordinated Lender and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Subordinated Lender, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability.
 
(c)                                  The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not violate any provision of any material requirement of law applicable to such Subordinated Lender or of any material contractual obligation of such Subordinated Lender.
 
(d)                                 No consent or authorization of filing with, or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority, is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, except for (i) such as have been obtained and are in full force and effect and (ii) such filings which the failure to obtain could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
SECTION 6.                            Waiver of Claims.  (a)  To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Subordinated Lender (in its capacity as such) waives any claim it might have against any Senior Lender with respect to, or arising out of, any action or failure to act or any error of judgment, negligence, or mistake or oversight whatsoever on the part of any Senior Lender or its directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates with respect to any exercise of rights or remedies under the Loan Documents or any transaction relating to the Collateral, except to the
 
G-7





 
extent (x) determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and non-appealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Senior Lender or (y) made with respect to disputes between and among Senior Lenders (other than disputes against any Senior Lender in its capacity, or fulfilling its role as, an administrative agent or arranger (or against any other Senior Lender acting in its capacity as affiliate, officer, director or employee for such administrative agent or arranger acting in such capacity or role), or any similar role under the Loan Documents).  None of the Senior Lenders nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates shall be liable to any Subordinated Lender (in its capacity as such) for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or any Guarantee or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Subordinated Borrower, any of its subsidiaries, any guarantor of the Senior Obligations, any Subordinated Lender or any other person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Security Documents, including, without limitation, the Guarantee and Security Agreement, or any part thereof.
 
(b)                                 To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Subordinated Lender, for itself and on behalf of its successors and assigns, hereby waives any and all now existing or hereafter arising rights it may have to require the Senior Lenders to marshal assets for the benefit of such Subordinated Lender, or to otherwise direct the timing, order or manner of any sale, collection or other enforcement of the Collateral or enforcement of the Loan Documents.  The Senior Lenders are under no duty or obligation, and each Subordinated Lender hereby waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to compel the Senior Lenders, to pursue any Subordinated Borrower, any of its subsidiaries, any guarantor or other person who may be liable for the Senior Obligations, or to enforce any Lien or security interest in any Collateral.
 
(c)                                  Each Subordinated Lender hereby waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any duty on the part of the Senior Lenders to disclose to it any fact known or hereafter known by the Senior Lenders relating to the operation or financial condition of any Subordinated Borrower, any of its subsidiaries or any guarantor of the Senior Obligations, or their respective businesses.  Each Subordinated Lender enters into this Agreement based solely upon its independent knowledge of the applicable Subordinated Borrowers results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) and business and the Subordinated Lender assumes full responsibility for obtaining any further or future information with respect to the applicable Subordinated Borrower, any of its subsidiaries, any guarantor of the Senior Obligations or their respective results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or business.
 
SECTION 7.                            Further Assurances.  Each Subordinated Lender and each Subordinated Borrower, at their own expense and at any time from time to time, upon the written request of the Administrative Agent shall promptly and duly execute and deliver such further instruments and documents and take such further actions as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of obtaining, preserving or extending the full benefits of this Agreement and of the rights, powers, remedies, benefits and interests of the Senior Lenders herein granted.
 
SECTION 8.                            [Reserved].
 
G-8





 
SECTION 9.                            Provisions Define Relative Rights.  This Agreement is intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Senior Lenders, on the one hand, and the Subordinated Lenders and the Subordinated Borrowers, on the other hand, and no other person shall have any right, remedy, benefit or other interest under this Agreement.
 
SECTION 10.                     Powers Coupled with an Interest.  All powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable until the Senior Obligations are unconditionally, finally and irrevocably paid in full in cash (other than indemnification obligations and other contingent obligations not then due and payable).
 
SECTION 11.                     Notices.  All notices, requests and demands to or upon any party hereto shall be in writing and shall be given in the manner provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement.
 
SECTION 12.                     Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute a single contract.  Delivery of an execut

ronic) transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement.
 
SECTION 13.                     Severability.  In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision hereof in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction).  The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.
 
SECTION 14.                     Integration.  This Agreement represents the agreement of the Subordinated Borrowers, the Subordinated Lenders and the Senior Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and there are no promises or representations by any Subordinated Borrower, any Subordinated Lender or the Senior Lenders relative to the subject matter hereof not reflected herein.
 
SECTION 15.                     Amendments in Writing; No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  (a)  None of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by a written instrument executed by the Administrative Agent, each affected Subordinated Borrower and each affected Subordinated Lender; provided that any provision of this Agreement may be waived by the Senior Lenders in a letter or agreement executed by the Required Lenders, or by the Administrative Agent with the written consent of the Required Lenders, and each affected Subordinated Lender.
 
(b)                                 No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent or any other Senior Lender in exercising any right, power, remedy, benefit or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power, remedy, benefit
 
G-9





 
or privilege, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right, power, remedy, benefit or privilege, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, remedy, benefit or privilege.
 
(c)                                  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and each other Senior Lender herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that any of them would otherwise have.

SECTION 17.                     Successors and Assigns.  (a)  This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the Subordinated Borrowers and each of the Subordinated Lenders and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and each other Senior Lender and their respective successors and assigns.
 
(b)                                 Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (a) above, nothing herein shall be construed to limit or relieve the obligations of any Subordinated Lender pursuant to Section 3, and no Subordinated Lender shall assign its obligations hereunder to any person (except as otherwise specifically permitted under Section 3); any such assignment other than as specifically permitted under Section 3 shall be void.

(c)                                  Each Subordinated Lender hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents in any New York State or Federal court.  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

SECTION 20.       Additional Subordinated Lenders.  Upon execution and delivery by the Administrative Agent and a Subsidiary of an instrument substantially in the form of Annex 2 attached hereto, such Subsidiary shall become a Subordinated Lender and a Subordinated Borrower hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Subordinated Lender and a Subordinated Borrower herein.  The execution and delivery of any such instrument shall not require the consent of any other Subordinated Lender or Subordinated Borrower hereunder.  The rights and obligations of each Subordinated Borrower and each Subordinated Lender herein shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any Subordinated Lender and Subordinated Borrower as a party to this Agreement.
 
SECTION 21.       Termination or Release.  (a)  This Agreement and any Subordinated Obligations created hereby shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of the Obligations, at which time this Agreement shall terminate (other than Section 18 and Section 19 hereof, which Sections shall survive such termination); provided that such termination shall be subject in all respects to the provisions of Section 22 hereof.
 
(b)              A Subordinated Borrower or Subordinated Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder upon both (i) the consummation of any transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement and permitted (if addressed therein or, otherwise, not prohibited) by the other applicable Loan Documents as a result of which such Subordinated Borrower or Subordinated Lender ceases to be a Subsidiary and (ii) in the case of a Subordinated Borrower, forgiveness or repayment of all the Subordinated Obligations of such Subordinated Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; provided that upon an occurrence decribed in clause (i) above with respect to a Subordinated Borrower and prior to the occurrence of the events required by clause (ii) above, only the Subordinated Obligations that existed on the date that such Subordinated Borrower ceased to be a Subsidiary of the Borrower shall be subject to the provisions hereof.
 
G-11





 
SECTION 22.       Reinstatement.  If any Senior Lender is required in any insolvency, dissolution, wind-up, reorganization, assignment for the benefit of creditors, liquidation or voluntary or involuntary case or proceeding, similar proceeding under a Debtor Relief Law or otherwise to turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of any Subordinated Borrower any amount paid in respect of the Senior Obligations (a Recovery), then such Senior Lender shall be entitled to a reinstatement of Senior Obligations with respect to all such recovered amounts.  In such event, if the termination referred to in Section 21 hereof shall have occurred prior to such Recovery, this Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties hereto from such date of reinstatement.

Each Payor and any endorser of this Promissory Note hereby waives presentment, demand, protest and notice of any kind.  No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any rights hereunder on the part of the holder hereof shall operate as a waiver of such rights.
 
This Promissory Note has been pledged by each Payee to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, as security for such Payees obligations, if any, under the Credit Agreement and each other Loan Document to which such Payee is a party.  Each Payor acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties may exercise all the rights of the Payees under this Promissory Note and will not be subject to any abatement, reduction, recoupment, defense, setoff or counterclaim available to such Payor.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in any other agreement or in any such promissory note or other instrument, this Promissory Note (i) replaces and supersedes any and all promissory notes or other instruments which create or evidence any loans or advances made on or before the date hereof by any Group Member to any other Group Member and (ii) without the written consent of the Administrative Agent, shall not be deemed replaced, superseded or in any way modified by any promissory note or other instrument entered into on or after the date hereof which purports to create or evidence any loan or advance by any Group Member to any other Group Member.
 
THIS PROMISSORY NOTE AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS PROMISSORY NOTE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
 
From time to time after the date hereof, additional subsidiaries of the Group Members may become parties hereto by executing a counterpart signature page to this Promissory Note (each additional subsidiary, an Additional Payor).  Upon delivery of such counterpart signature page to the Payees, notice of which is hereby waived by the other Payors, each Additional Payor shall be a Payor and shall be as fully a party hereto as if such Additional Payor were an original signatory hereof.  Each Payor expressly agrees that its obligations arising hereunder sh

Annex 2 to the
Affiliate Subordination Agreement
 
SUPPLEMENT NO. [    ] dated as of [                ], 20[    ] (this Supplement), to the Affiliate Subordination Agreement dated as of [                ], 20[    ] (the Affiliate Subordination Agreement), among the subordinated lenders named therein (the Subordinated Lenders), the subordinated borrowers named therein (the Subordinated Borrowers) and Royal Bank of Canada, as administrative agent (in such capacity, including any successor thereto, the Administrative Agent) for the Senior Lenders.
 
A.                                    Reference is made to the Affiliate Subordination Agreement.
 
B.                                    Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Affiliate Subordination Agreement.
 
C.                                    Each of the Subordinated Lenders and each of the Subordinated Borrowers have entered into the Affiliate Subordination Agreement in order to induce the Senior Lenders to make Revolving Loans and other extensions of credit under the Credit Agreement.  Section 20 of the Affiliate Subordination Agreement provides that subsidiaries of the Borrower may become Subordinated Lenders and Subordinated Borrowers under the Affiliate Subordination Agreement by execution and delivery of an instrument in the form of this Supplement.  The undersigned Subsidiary (the New Subordinated Party) is executing this Supplement to become a Subordinated Lender and a Subordinated Borrower under the Affiliate Subordination Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement as consideration for Revolving Loans previously made or issued under the Credit Agreement.
 
Accordingly, the Administrative Agent and the New Subordinated Party agree as follows:
 
SECTION 1.                            In accordance with Section 20 of the Affiliate Subordination Agreement, the New Subordinated Party by its signature below becomes a Subordinated Lender and a Subordinated Borrower under the Affiliate Subordination Agreement with the same force and effect as if originally named therein as a Subordinated Lender and a Subordinated Borrower and the New Subordinated Party hereby (a) agrees to all the terms and provisions of the Affiliate Subordination Agreement applicable to it as a Subordinated Lender and a Subordinated Borrower thereunder and (b) represents and warrants that the representations and warranties made by it as a Subordinated Lender and a Subordinated Borrower thereunder are true and correct in all material respects, except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representation that is already qualified by materiality, on and as of the date hereof except for representations and warranties which by their terms refer to a specific date, which representations and warranties were true and correct on such specific date.  Each reference to a Subordinated Lender or a Subordinated Borrower in the Affiliate Subordination Agreement shall be deemed to include the New Subordinated Party.  The Affiliate Subordination Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
 
SECTION 2.                            The New Subordinated Party represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the other Senior Lenders that this Supplement has been duly

authorized, executed and delivered by it and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability.
 
SECTION 3.                            This Supplement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  Delivery of an executed signature page to this Supplement by facsimile (or other electronic) transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Supplement.  This Supplement shall become effective when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts of this Supplement that, when taken together, bear the signatures of the New Subordinated Party and the Administrative Agent.
 
SECTION 4.                            Except as expressly supplemented hereby, the Affiliate Subordination Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
 
SECTION 5.                            THIS SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
 
SECTION 6.                            In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained in this Supplement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and in the Affiliate Subordination Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision hereof in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction).  The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.
 
SECTION 7.                            All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in Section 11 of the Affiliate Subordination Agreement.  All communications and notices hereunder to the New Subordinated Party shall be given to it at the address set forth under its signature below, with a copy to the Borrower.
 
SECTION 8.                            The New Subordinated Party shall reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent and each other Senior Lender in the manner provided in Section 9.05 of the Credit Agreement.

The undersigned hereby certifies that he or she is the Financial Officer of Dynegy Power, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Borrower), and certifies on behalf of the Borrower, and not in his or her individual capacity, as follows:
 
I have reviewed the terms of the Credit Agreement dated as of January 16, 2013 (as may be amended, restated, replaced, refinanced, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement; capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement), among the Borrower, DYNEGY GAS INVESTMENTS HOLDINGS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders) and ROYAL BANK OF CANADA, as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, including any successor thereto, the Administrative Agent), and the other banks, other financial institutions and entities party thereto from time to time, and I have made, or have caused to be made under my supervision, a review in reasonable detail of the transactions and condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries during the accounting period covered by the attached financial statements.
 
Section references in this Compliance Certificate (this Compliance Certificate) relate to the Credit Agreement unless stated otherwise.  In the event of any conflict between the calculations set forth in this Compliance Certificate and the manner of calculation required by the Credit Agreement, the terms of the Credit Agreement shall govern and control.
 
The examinations described in the second paragraph above did not disclose the existence of any condition or event which constitutes an Event of Default or Default as of the date of this Compliance Certificate, except as set forth in a separate attachment, if any, to this Compliance Certificate, specifying the nature and extent thereof and the corrective action taken or proposed to be taken with respect thereto by the Borrower.
 
This Compliance Certificate is delivered in accordance with Section 5.04(c) of the Credit Agreement.  This Compliance Certificate is delivered for the fiscal [quarter][year] (the Test Period) ended [          ], 20[    ] (the Test Date).  Computations indicating compliance with respect to the covenants in Section 6.10 and, if required to be tested, 6.17 and 6.18 of the Credit Agreement are set forth at Section 1 of Annex A.  Computations showing the Borrowers reasonable determination of the net mark-to-market position for the Interest Rate/Currency Hedging Agreements and Eligible Commodity Hedging Agreements, in each case secured by Liens permitted pursuant to Section 6.02(k) of the Credit Agreement, then outstanding for each counterparty are set forth at Section 2 of Annex A.
