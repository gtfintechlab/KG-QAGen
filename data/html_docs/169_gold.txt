Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings specified therefor on Schedule 1.1.1.2.    Accounting Terms.  All accounting terms not specifically defined herein shall be construed in accordance with GAAP. If an Accounting Change occurs after December 31, 2012 (or such later date as Borrowers and Required Lenders agree to) that affects the calculation of any financial covenant or the operation of any other provision hereof, then Agent and Borrowers agree that they will negotiate in good faith amendments to the provisions of this Agreement to eliminate the effect of such Accounting Change with the intent of having the respective positions of the Lenders and Borrowers after such Accounting Change conform as nearly as possible to their respective positions as of December 31, 2012 (or such later date as Borrowers and Required Lenders agree to) and, until any such amendments have been agreed upon and agreed to by Borrowers and the Required Lenders, the provisions in this Agreement shall be calculated as if no such Accounting Change had occurred; provided, further, that notwithstanding any Accounting Change after December 31, 2012 that would require lease obligations that would be treated as operating leases as of December 31, 2012 to be classified and accounted for as capital leases or otherwise reflected on Parent and its Subsidiaries' consolidated balance sheet, for the purposes of determining compliance with any covenant contained herein, such obligations shall be treated in the same manner as operating leases are treated as of December 31, 2012.  When used herein, the term "financial statements" shall include the notes and schedules thereto.  Whenever the term "Parent" is used in respect of a financial covenant or a related definition, it shall be understood to mean Parent and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless the context clearly requires otherwise.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (a) all financial statements delivered hereunder shall be prepared, and all financial covenants contained herein shall be calculated, without giving effect to any election under the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159 (or any similar accounting principle) permitting a Person to value its financial liabilities or Indebtedness at the fair value thereof, and (b) the term "unqualified opinion" as used herein to refer to opinions or reports provided by accountants shall mean an opinion or report that is (i) unqualified, and (ii) does not include any explanation, supplemental comment, or other comment concerning the ability of the applicable Person to continue as a going concern or concerning the scope of the audit.1.3.    Code.  Any terms used in this Agreement that are defined in the Code shall be construed and defined as 

ment or in any other Loan Document to any agreement, instrument, or document shall include all alterations, amendments, changes, extensions, modifications, renewals, replacements, substitutions, joinders, and supplements, thereto and thereof, as applicable (subject to any restrictions on such alterations, amendments, changes, extensions, modifications, renewals, replacements, substitutions, joinders, and supplements set forth herein).  The words "asset" and "property" shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect and to refer to any and all tangible and intangible assets and properties.  Any reference herein or in any other Loan Document to the satisfaction, repayment, or payment in full of the Obligations shall mean (a) the payment or repayment in full in immediately available funds of (i) the principal amount of, and interest accrued and unpaid with respect to, all outstanding Loans, together with the payment of any premium applicable to the repayment of the Loans, (ii) all Lender Group Expenses that have accrued and are unpaid regardless of whether demand has been made therefor, (iii) all fees or charges that have accrued hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including the Letter of Credit Fee and the Unused Line Fee) and are unpaid, (b) in the case of contingent reimbursement obligations with respect to Letters of Credit, providing Letter of Credit Collateralization, (c) in the case of obligations with respect to Bank Products (other than Hedge Obligations), providing Bank Product Collateralization, (d) the receipt by Agent of cash collateral in order to secure any other contingent Obligations for which a claim or demand for payment has been made on or prior to such time or in respect of matters or circumstances known to Agent or a Lender at such time that are reasonably expected to result in any loss, cost, damage, or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses), such cash collateral to be in such amount as Agent reasonably determines is appropriate to secure such contingent Obligations, (e) the payment or repayment in full in immediately available funds of all other outstanding Obligations (including the payment of any termination amount then applicable (or which would or could become applicable as a result of the repayment of the other Obligations) under Hedge Agreements provided by Hedge Providers) other than (i) unasserted contingent indemnification Obligations, (ii) any Bank Product Obligations (other than Hedge Obligations) that, at such time, are allowed by the applicable Bank Product Provider to remain outstanding without being required to be repaid or cash collateralized, and (iii) any Hedge Obligations that, at such time, are allowed by the applicable Hedge Provider to remain outstanding without being required to be repaid, and (f) the termination of all of the Commitments of the Lenders.  Any reference herein to any Person shall be construed to include such Person's successors and assigns.  Any requirement of a writing contained herein or in any other Loan Document shall be satisfied by the transmission of a Record.1.5.    Time References.  Unless the context of this Agreement or any other Loan Document clearly requires otherwise, all references to time of day refer to Central standard time or Central daylight saving time, as in effect in Chicago, Illinois on such day.  For purposes of the computation of a period of time from a specified date to a later specified date, the word "from" means "from and including" and the words "to" and "until" each means "to and including"; provided that, with respect to a computation of fees or interest payable to Agent or any Lender, such period shall in any event consist of at least one full day.1.6.    Schedules and Exhibits.  All of the schedules and exhibits attached to this Agreement and the Disclosure Letter shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference.-3-Exhibit 10.12.LOANS AND TERMS OF PAYMENT.2.1.    Revolving Loans.(a)    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and during the term of this Agreement, each Revolving Lender agrees (severally, not jointly or jointly and severally) to make revolving loans ("Revolving Loans") to Borrowers in an amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the lesser of:(i)    such Lender's Revolver Commitment, or(ii)    such Lender's Pro Rata Share of an amount equal to the lesser of:(A)    the amount equal to (1) the Maximum Revolver Amount less (2) the sum of (y) the Letter of Credit Usage at such time, plus (z) the principal amount of Swing Loans outstanding at such time, and(B)    the amount equal to the Borrowing Base as of such date (based upon the most recent Borrowing Base Certificate delivered by Borrowers to Agent) less the sum of (1) the Letter of Credit Usage at such time, plus (2) the principal amount of Swing Loans outstanding at such time.(b)    Amounts borrowed pursuant to this Section 2.1 may be repaid and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, reborrowed at any time during the term of this Agreement.  The outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans, together with interest accrued and unpaid thereon, shall constitute Obligations and shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date or, if earlier, on the date on which they are declared due and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.(c)    Anything to the contrary in this Section 2.1 notwithstanding, Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation), in the exercise of its Permitted Discretion, to establish and increase or decrease Receivable Reserves, Inventory Reserves, Bank Product Reserves, PACA/Growers Reserves and other Reserves against the Borrowing Base or the Maximum Revolver Amount.  The amount of any Receivable Reserve, Inventory Reserve, Bank Product Reserve, PACA/Growers Reserve, or other Reserve established by Agent shall have a reasonable relationship to the event, condition, other circumstance, or fact that is the basis for such reserve and shall not be duplicative of any other reserve established and currently maintained.2.2.    Term Loan.Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date each Lender with a Term Loan Commitment agrees (severally, not jointly or jointly and severally) to make term loans (collectively, the "Term Loan") to Borrowers in an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Term Loan Amount.  The principal of the Term Loan shall be repaid in monthly installments of $125,000 on the first day of each calendar month (commencing April 1, 2013) until repaid in full.  The outstanding unpaid principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest on the Term Loan shall be due and payable on the earlier of (i) the Maturity Date, and (ii) the date of the acceleration of the Term Loan in accordance with the terms hereof.  Any -4-Exhibit 10.1principal amount of the Term Loan that is repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.  All principal of, interest on, and other amounts payable in respect of the Term Loan shall constitute Obligations hereunder.2.3.    Borrowing Procedures and Settlements.(a)    Procedure for Borrowing Revolving Loans.  Each Borrowing shall be made by a written request by an Authorized Person delivered to Agent and received by Agent no later than 12:00 noon (i) on the Business Day that is the requested Funding Date in the case of a request for a Swing Loan, and (ii) on the Business Day that is at least 1 Business Day prior to the requested Funding Date in the case of all other requests, specifying (A) the amount of such Borrowing, and (B) the requested Funding Date (which shall be a Business Day); provided, that Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to accept as timely requests that are received later than 12:00 noon on the applicable Business Day.  At Agent's election, in lieu of delivering the above-described written request, any Authorized Person may give Agent telephonic notice of such request by the required time.  In such circumstances, Borrowers agree that any such telephonic notice will be confirmed in writing within 24 hours of the giving of such telephonic notice, but the failure to provide such written confirmation shall not affect the validity of the request.(b)    Making of Swing Loans.  In the case of a request for a Revolving Loan and so long as the aggregate amount of Swing Loans made since the last Settlement Date, minus all payments or other amounts applied to Swing Loans since the last Settlement Date, plus the amount of the requested Swing Loan does not exceed 10% of the Maximum Stated Revolver Amount, Swing Lender shall make a Revolving Loan (any such Revolving Loan made by Swing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) being referred to as a "Swing Loan" and all such Revolving Loans being referred to as "Swing Loans") available to Borrowers on the Funding Date applicable thereto by transferring immediately available funds in the amount of such requested Borrowing to the Designated Account. Each Swing Loan shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder and shall be subject to all the terms and conditions (including Section 3) applicable to other Revolving Loans, except that all payments (including interest) on any Swing Loan shall be payable to Swing Lender solely for its own account.  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(d)(ii), Swing Lender shall not make and shall not be obligated to make any Swing Loan if Swing Lender has actual knowledge that (i) one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing, or (ii) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Availability on such Funding Date.  Swing Lender shall not otherwise be required to determine whether the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 have been satisfied on the Funding Date applicable thereto prior to making any Swing Loan.  The Swing Loans shall be secured by Agent's Liens, constitute Revolving Loans and Obligations, and bear interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans.(c)    Making of Revolving Loans.(i)    In the event that Swing Lender is not obligated to make a Swing Loan, then after receipt of a request for a Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.3(a), Agent shall notify the Lenders by telecopy, telephone, email, or other electronic form of transmission, of the requested Borrowing; such notification to be sent on the Business Day that is at least 1 Business Day prior to -5-Exhibit 10.1the requested Funding Date.  If Agent has notified the Lenders of a requested Borrowing on the Business Day that is 1 Business Day prior to the Funding Date, then each Lender shall make the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the requested Borrowing available to Agent in immediately available funds, to Agent's Account, not later than 12:00 noon on the Business Day that is the requested Funding Date.  After Agent's receipt of the proceeds of such Revolving Loans from the Lenders, Agent shall make the proceeds thereof available to Borrowers on the applicable Funding Date by transferring immediately available funds equal to such proceeds received by Agent to the Designated Account; provided, that, subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(d)(ii), no Lender shall have an obligation to make any Revolving Loan, if (1) one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing unless such condition has been waived, or (2) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Availability on such Funding Date.(ii)    Unless Agent receives notice from a Lender prior to 9:30 a.m. on the Business Day that is the requested Funding Date relative to a requested Borrowing as to which Agent has notified the Lenders of a requested Borrowing that such Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to Agent for the account of Borrowers the amount of that Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, Agent may assume that each Lender has made or will make such amount available to Agent in immediately available funds on the Funding Date and Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrowers a corresponding amount.  If, on the requested Funding Date, any Lender shall not have remitted the full amount that it is required to make available to Agent in immediately available funds and if Agent has made available to Borrowers such amount on the requested Funding Date, then such Lender shall make the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the requested Borrowing available to Agent in immediately available funds, to Agent's Account, no later than 12:00 noon on the Business Day that is the first Business Day after the requested Funding Date (in which case, the interest accrued on such Lender's portion of such Borrowing for the Funding Date shall be for Agent's separate account).  If any Lender shall not remit the full amount that it is required to make available to Agent in immediately available funds as and when required hereby and if Agent has made available to Borrowers such amount, then that Lender shall be obligated to immediately remit such amount to Agent, together with interest at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day until the date on which such amount is so remitted.  A notice submitted by Agent to any Lender with respect to amounts owing under this Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  If the amount that a Lender is required to remit is made available to Agent, then such payment to Agent shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Loan for all purposes of this Agreement.  If such amount is not made available to Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date, Agent will notify Borrowers of such failure to fund and, upon demand by Agent, Borrowers shall pay such amount to Agent for Agent's account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Loans composing such Borrowing.(d)    Protective Advances and Optional Overadvances.(i)    Any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document notwithstanding, but subject to Section 2.3(d)(iv), at any time (A) after the occurrence -6-Exhibit 10.1and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, or (B) that any of the other applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 are not satisfied, Agent hereby is authorized by Borrowers and the Lenders, from time to time, in Agent's sole discretion, to make Revolving Loans to, or for the benefit of, Borrowers, on behalf of the Revolving Lenders, that Agent, in its Permitted Discretion, deems necessary or appropriate (1) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, or (2) to enhance the likelihood of repayment of the Obligations (other than the Bank Product Obligations) (the Revolving Loans described in this Section 2.3(d)(i) shall be referred to as "Protective Advances").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate amount of all Protective Advances outstanding at any one time shall not exceed 10% of the Maximum Revolver Amount (unless Required Lenders otherwise agree to a higher aggregate amount).(ii)    Any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document notwithstanding, but subject to Section 2.3(d)(iv), the Lenders hereby authorize Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, and either Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, may, but is not obligated to, knowingly and intentionally, continue to make Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans) to Borrowers notwithstanding that an Overadvance exists or would be created thereby, so long as (A) after giving effect to such Revolving Loans, the outstanding Revolver Usage does not exceed the Borrowing Base by more than 10% of the Maximum Revolver Amount (unless Required Lenders otherwise agree to a higher aggregate amount), and (B) after giving effect to such Revolving Loans, the outstanding Revolver Usage (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) does not exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount.  In the event Agent obtains actual knowledge that the Revolver Usage exceeds the amounts permitted by the immediately foregoing provisions, regardless of the amount of, or reason for, such excess, Agent shall notify the Lenders as soon as practicable (and prior to making any (or any additional) intentional Overadvances (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) unless Agent reasonably determines that prior notice would result in imminent harm to the Collateral or its value, in which case Agent may make such Overadvances and provide notice as promptly as practicable thereafter), and the Lenders with Revolver Commitments thereupon shall, together with Agent, jointly determine the terms of arrangements that shall be implemented with Borrowers intended to reduce, within a 30 days, the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans to Borrowers to an amount permitted by the preceding sentence.  In such circumstances, if any Lender with a Revolver Commitment objects to the proposed terms of reduction or repayment of any Overadvance, the terms of reduction or repayment thereof shall be implemented according to the determination of the Required Lenders.  The foregoing provisions are meant for the benefit of the Lenders and Agent and are not meant for the benefit of Borrowers, which shall continue to be bound by the provisions of Section 2.4(e).  Each Lender with a Revolver Commitment shall be obligated to make Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.3(c), or settle Overadvances made by Agent with Agent as provided in Section 2.3(e)(or Section 2.3(g), as applicable), for the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any unintentional Overadvances by Agent reported to such Lender, any intentional Overadvances made as permitted under this Section 2.3(d)(ii), and any Overadvances resulting from the charging to the Loan Account of interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses.(iii)    Each Protective Advance and each Overadvance (each, an "Extraordinary Advance") shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder.  No Extraordinary -7-Exhibit 10.1Advance shall be eligible to be a LIBOR Rate Loan.  Prior to Settlement with respect to any Extraordinary Advances, all payments on the Extraordinary Advances, including interest thereon, shall be payable to Agent solely for its own account.  The Extraordinary Advances shall be repayable on demand, secured by Agent's Liens, constitute Obligations hereunder, and bear interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans.  The provisions of this Section 2.3(d) are for the exclusive benefit of Agent, Swing Lender, and the Lenders and are not intended to benefit Borrowers (or any other Loan Party) in any way.(iv)    Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, no Extraordinary Advance may be made by Agent if such Extraordinary Advance would cause the aggregate principal amount of Extraordinary Advances outstanding to exceed an amount equal to 10% of the Maximum Revolver Amount (unless Required Lenders otherwise agree to a higher amount).(e)    Settlement.  It is agreed that each Lender's funded portion of the Revolving Loans is intended by the Lenders to equal, at all times, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Revolving Loans.  Such agreement notwithstanding, Agent, Swing Lender, and the other Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be for the benefit of Borrowers) that in order to facilitate the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, settlement among the Lenders as to the Revolving Loans (including the Swing Loans, and the Extraordinary Advances) shall take place on a periodic basis in accordance with the following provisions:(i)    Agent shall request settlement ("Settlement") with the Lenders on a weekly basis, or on a more frequent basis if so determined by Agent in its sole discretion (1) on behalf of Swing Lender, with respect to the outstanding Swing Loans, (2) for itself, with respect to the outstanding Extraordinary Advances, and (3) with respect to Loan Parties' payments or other amounts received, as to each by notifying the Lenders by telecopy, telephone, or other similar form of transmission, of such requested Settlement, no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately prior to the date of such requested Settlement (the date of such requested Settlement being the "Settlement Date").  Such notice of a Settlement Date shall include a summary statement of the amount of outstanding Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) for the period since the prior Settlement Date.  Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein (including Section 2.3(g)):  (y) if the amount of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) made by a Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender exceeds such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) as of a Settlement Date, then Agent shall, by no later than 12:00 p.m. on the Settlement Date, transfer in immediately available funds to a Deposit Account of such Lender (as such Lender may designate), an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have as of the Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances), and (z) if the amount of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans, and Extraordinary Advances) made by a Lender is less than such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans, and Extraordinary Advances) as of a Settlement Date, such Lender shall no later than 12:00 p.m. on the Settlement Date transfer in immediately available funds to Agent's Account, an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon transfer of such amount, have as of the Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans -8-Exhibit 10.1and Extraordinary Advances).  Such amounts made available to Agent under clause (z) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be applied against the amounts of the applicable Swing Loans or Extraordinary Advances.  If any such amount is not made available to Agent by any Lender on the Settlement Date applicable thereto to the extent required by the terms hereof, Agent shall be entitled to recover for its account such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate.(ii)    In determining whether a Lender's balance of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) is less than, equal to, or greater than such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans as of a Settlement Date, Agent shall, as part of the relevant Settlement, apply to such balance the portion of payments actually received in good funds by Agent with respect to principal, interest, fees payable by Borrowers and allocable to the Lenders hereunder, and proceeds of Collateral.(iii)    Between Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent Extraordinary Advances for the account of Agent or Swing Loans for the account of Swing Lender are outstanding, may pay over to Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, any payments or other amounts received by Agent, that in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Revolving Loans, for application to the Extraordinary Advances or Swing Loans.  Between Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent no Extraordinary Advances or Swing Loans are outstanding, may pay over to Swing Lender any payments or other amounts received by Agent, that in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Revolving Loans, for application to Swing Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans.  If, as of any Settlement Date, payments or other amounts of Loan Parties received since the then immediately preceding Settlement Date have been applied to Swing Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans other than to Swing Loans, as provided for in the previous sentence, Swing Lender shall pay to Agent for the accounts of the Lenders, and Agent shall pay to the Lenders (other than a Defaulting Lender if Agent has implemented the provisions of Section 2.3(g)), to be applied to the outstanding Revolving Loans of such Lenders, an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have, as of such Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans.  During the period between Settlement Dates, Swing Lender with respect to Swing Loans, Agent with respect to Extraordinary Advances, and each Lender with respect to the Revolving Loans other than Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances, shall be entitled to interest at the applicable rate or rates payable under this Agreement on the daily amount of funds employed by Swing Lender, Agent, or the Lenders, as applicable.(iv)    Anything in this Section 2.3(e) to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, Agent shall be entitled to refrain from remitting settlement amounts to the Defaulting Lender and, instead, shall be entitled to elect to implement the provisions set forth in Section 2.3(g).(f)    Notation.  Agent, as a non-fiduciary agent for Borrowers, shall maintain a register showing the principal amount of the Revolving Loans owing to each Lender, including the Swing Loans owing to Swing Lender, and Extraordinary Advances owing to Agent, and the interests -9-Exhibit 10.1therein of each Lender, from time to time and such register shall, absent manifest error, conclusively be presumed to be correct and accurate.(g)    Defaulting Lenders.(i)    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(b)(ii), Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments made by Borrowers to Agent for the Defaulting Lender's benefit or any proceeds of Collateral that would otherwise be remitted hereunder to the Defaulting Lender, and, in the absence of such transfer to the Defaulting Lender, Agent shall transfer any such payments (A) first, to Agent to the extent of any Extraordinary Advances that were made by Agent and that were required to be, but were not, paid by Defaulting Lender, (B) second, to Swing Lender to the extent of any Swing Loans that were made by Swing Lender and that were required to be, but were not, paid by the Defaulting Lender, (C) third, to Issuing Bank, to the extent of the portion of a Letter of Credit Disbursement that was required to be, but was not, paid by the Defaulting Lender, (D) fourth, to each Non-Defaulting Lender ratably in accordance with their Commitments (but, in each case, only to the extent that such Defaulting Lender's portion of a Revolving Loan (or other funding obligation) was funded by such other Non-Defaulting Lender), (E) fifth, in Agent's sole discretion, to a suspense account maintained by Agent, the proceeds of which shall be retained by Agent and may be made available to be re-advanced to or for the benefit of Borrowers (upon the request of Borrowers and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 3.2) as if such Defaulting Lender had made its portion of Revolving Loans (or other funding obligations) hereunder, and (F) sixth, from and after the date on which all other Obligations have been paid in full, to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with tier (N) of Section 2.4(b)(ii).  Subject to the foregoing, Agent may hold and, in its discretion, re-lend to Borrowers for the account of such Defaulting Lender the amount of all such payments received and retained by Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender.  Solely for the purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents (including the calculation of Pro Rata Share in connection therewith) and for the purpose of calculating the fee payable under Section 2.10(b), such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a "Lender" and such Lender's Commitment shall be deemed to be zero; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to any of the matters governed by Section 14.1(a)(i) through (iii).  The provisions of this Section 2.3(g) shall remain effective with respect to such Defaulting Lender until the earlier of (y) the date on which all of the Non-Defaulting Lenders, Agent, Issuing Bank, and Borrowers shall have waived, in writing, the application of this Section 2.3(g) to such Defaulting Lender, or (z) the date on which such Defaulting Lender makes payment of all amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, pays to Agent all amounts owing by Defaulting Lender in respect of the amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder and any Funding Losses incurred by any Non-Defaulting Lender resulting from such Defaulting Lender making payment of amounts necessary to become a Non-Defaulting Lender, and, if requested by Agent, provides adequate assurance of its ability to perform its future obligations hereunder (on which earlier date, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any remaining cash collateral held by Agent pursuant to Section 2.3(g)(ii) shall be released to Borrowers).  The operation of this Section 2.3(g) shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, to relieve or excuse the performance by such Defaulting Lender or any other Lender of its duties and obligations hereunder, or to relieve or excuse the performance by any Borrower of its duties and obligations hereunder to Agent, Issuing Bank, or to the Lenders other than such Defaulting Lender.  Any failure by a -10-Exhibit 10.1Defaulting Lender to fund amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder shall constitute a material breach by such Defaulting Lender of this Agreement and shall entitle Borrowers, at their option, upon written notice to Agent, to arrange for a substitute Lender to assume the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, such substitute Lender to be reasonably acceptable to Agent.  In connection with the arrangement of such a substitute Lender, the Defaulting Lender shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder, and agrees to execute and deliver a completed form of Assignment and Acceptance in favor of the substitute Lender (and agrees that it shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such document if it fails to do so) subject only to being paid its share of the outstanding Obligations (other than Bank Product Obligations, but including (1) all interest, fees, and other amounts that may be due and payable in respect thereof, and (2) an assumption of its Pro Rata Share of its participation in the Letters of Credit); provided, that any such assumption of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any of the Lender Groups' or Borrowers' rights or remedies against any such Defaulting Lender arising out of or in relation to such failure to fund.  In the event of a direct conflict between the priority provisions of this Section 2.3(g) and any other provision contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other.  In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this Section 2.3(g) shall control and govern.(ii)    If any Swing Loan or Letter of Credit is outstanding at the time that a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:(A)    such Defaulting Lender's Swing Loan Exposure and Letter of Credit Exposure shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares but only to the extent (x) the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Loan Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Swing Loan Exposure and Letter of Credit Exposure does not exceed the total of all Non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolver Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 3.2 are satisfied at such time;(B)    if the reallocation described in clause (A) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, Borrowers shall within one Business Day following notice by the Agent (x) first, prepay such Defaulting Lender's Swing Loan Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (A) above) and (y) second, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (A) above), pursuant to a cash collateral agreement to be entered into in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, for so long as such Letter of Credit Exposure is outstanding; provided, that Borrowers shall not be obligated to cash collateralize any Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Exposure if such Defaulting Lender is also the Issuing Bank;(C)    if Borrowers cash collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Exposure pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii), Borrowers shall not be required to pay any Letter of Credit Fees to Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.6(b) with respect to such cash collateralized portion of such Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Exposure during the period such Letter of Credit Exposure is cash collateralized;-11-Exhibit 10.1(D)    to the extent the Letter of Credit Exposure of the Non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii), then the Letter of Credit Fees payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders pursuant to Section 2.6(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders' Letter of Credit Exposure;(E)    to the extent any Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all Letter of Credit Fees that would have otherwise been payable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.6(b) with respect to such portion of such Letter of Credit Exposure shall instead be payable to the Issuing Bank until such portion of such Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Exposure is cash collateralized or reallocated;(F)    so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swing Lender shall not be required to make any Swing Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend, or increase any Letter of Credit, in each case, to the extent (x) the Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Swing Loans or Letter of Credit cannot be reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii) or (y) the Swing Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, has not otherwise entered into arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Swing Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, and Borrowers to eliminate the Swing Lender's or Issuing Bank's risk with respect to the Defaulting Lender's participation in Swing Loans or Letters of Credit; and(G)    Agent may release any cash collateral provided by Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii) to the Issuing Bank and the Issuing Bank may apply any such cash collateral to the payment of such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of any Letter of Credit Disbursement that is not reimbursed by Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.11(d).(h)    Independent Obligations.  All Revolving Loans (other than Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) shall be made by the Lenders contemporaneously and in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares.  It is understood that (i) no Lender shall be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loan (or other extension of credit) hereunder, nor shall any Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) no failure by any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder shall excuse any other Lender from its obligations hereunder.2.4.    Payments; Reductions of Commitments; Prepayments.(a)    Payments by Borrowers.(i)    Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by Borrowers shall be made to Agent's Account for the account of the Lender Group and shall be made in immediately available funds, no later than 1:30 p.m. on the date specified herein.  Any payment received by Agent later than 1:30 p.m. shall be deemed to have been received (unless Agent, in its sole discretion, elects to credit it on the date received) on the following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue until such following Business Day.-12-Exhibit 10.1(ii)    Unless Agent receives notice from Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that Borrowers will not make such payment in full as and when required, Agent may assume that Borrowers have made (or will make) such payment in full to Agent on such date in immediately available funds and Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.  If and to the extent Borrowers do not make such payment in full to Agent on the date when due, each Lender severally shall repay to Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date repaid.(b)    Apportionment and Application.(iii)    So long as no Application Event has occurred and is continuing and except as otherwise provided herein with respect to Defaulting Lenders, all principal and interest payments received by Agent shall be apportioned ratably among the Lenders (according to the unpaid principal balance of the Obligations to which such payments relate held by each Lender) and all payments of fees and expenses received by Agent (other than fees or expenses that are for Agent's separate account or for the separate account of Issuing Bank) shall be apportioned ratably among the Lenders having a Pro Rata Share of the type of Commitment or Obligation to which a particular fee or expense relates.  Subject to Section 2.4(b)(iv) and Section 2.4(e), all payments to be made hereunder by Borrowers shall be remitted to Agent and all such payments, and all proceeds of Collateral received by Agent, shall be applied, so long as no Application Event has occurred and is continuing and except as otherwise provided herein with respect to Defaulting Lenders, to reduce the balance of the Revolving Loans outstanding and, thereafter, to Borrowers (to be wired to the Designated Account) or such other Person entitled thereto under applicable law.(iv)    At any time that an Application Event has occurred and is continuing and except as otherwise provided herein with respect to Defaulting Lenders, all payments remitted to Agent and all proceeds of Collateral received by Agent shall be applied as follows:(A)    first, to pay any Lender Group Expenses (including cost or expense reimbursements) or indemnities then due to Agent under the Loan Documents, until paid in full,(B)    second, to pay any fees or premiums then due to Agent under the Loan Documents until paid in full,(C)    third, to pay interest due in respect of all Protective Advances until paid in full,(D)    fourth, to pay the

Letter of Credit Usage (to the extent permitted by applicable law, such cash collateral shall be applied to the reimbursement of any Letter of Credit Disbursement as and when such disbursement occurs and, if a Letter of Credit expires undrawn, the cash collateral held by Agent in respect of such Letter of Credit shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be reapplied pursuant to this Section 2.4(b)(ii), beginning with tier (A) hereof),iii.    up to the amount (after taking into account any amounts previously paid pursuant to this clause iii. during the continuation of the applicable Application Event) of the most recently established Bank Product Reserve, which amount was established prior to the occurrence of, and not in contemplation of, the subject Application Event, to (y) ratably (based on the Bank Product Reserve established for each Bank Product) to the Bank Product Providers up to the amounts then certified by the applicable Bank Product Provider to

writing, such funds as it may be entitled to receive, subject to a Settlement delay as provided in Section 2.3(e).(vi)    In each instance, so long as no Application Event has occurred and is continuing, Section 2.4(b)(i) shall not apply to any payment made by Borrowers to Agent and specified by Borrowers to be for the payment of specific Obligations then due and payable (or prepayable)

funds of all amounts owing on account of such type of Obligation, including interest accrued after the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding, default interest, interest on interest, and expense reimbursements, irrespective of whether any of the foregoing would be or is allowed or disallowed in whole or in part in any Insolvency Proceeding.(viii)    In the event of a direct conflict between the priority provisions of this Section 2.4 and any other provision contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other.  In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, if the conflict relates to the provisions of Section 2.3(g) and this Section 2.4, then the provisions of Section 2.3(g) shall control and govern, and if otherwise, then the terms and provisions of this Section 2.4 shall control and govern.-15-Exhibit 10.1(c)    Reduction of Commitments.(v)    Revolver Commitments.  The Revolver Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.

Each such reduction shall be in an amount which is not less than $10,000,000 (unless the Revolver Commitments are being reduced to zero and the amount of the Revolver Commitments in effect immediately prior to such reduction are less than $10,000,000), shall be made by providing not less than 10 Business Days prior written notice to Agent, and shall be irrevocable.  Once reduced, the Revolver Commitments may not be increased.

Each such prepayment shall be applied against the remaining installments of principal due on the Term Loan in the inverse order of maturity (for the avoidance of doubt, any amount that is due and payable on the Maturity Date shall constitute an installment).(e)    Mandatory Prepayments.(i)    Borrowing Base.  If, at any time, (A)  the Revolver Usage on such date exceeds (B) the Borrowing Base reflected in the Borrowing Base Certificate most recently delivered by Borrowers to Agent, then Borrowers shall immediately prepay the Obligations in accordance with Section 2.4(f)(i) in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of such excess.(ii)    Dispositions.  Within 3 Business Days of the date of receipt by any Loan Party of the Net Cash Proceeds of any voluntary or involuntary sale or disposition by such Loan Party of ABL Priority Collateral that result in Net Cash Proceeds greater than $10,000,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year (including casualty losses or condemnations but excluding (A) sales or dispositions which qualify as Permitted Dispositions under clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (i), (j), (k), (l), (m),(n) or (q) of the definition of Permitted Dispositions, and (B) sales or dispositions of any assets that constitute Eligible Equipment unless the Fixed Asset Sub-Line Amount has been -16-Exhibit 10.1reduced to zero), Borrowers shall prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Obligations in accordance with Section 2.4(f)(ii) in an amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds (including condemnation awards and payments in lieu thereof) received by such Person in connection with such sales or dispositions; provided that, so long as (A) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, (B) Administrative Borrower shall have given Agent prior written notice of such Borrowers' intention to apply such monies to the costs of repair, restoration or replacement of the properties or assets that are the subject of such sale or disposition or the cost of purchase or construction of other assets of a Loan Party useful in the business of Loan Parties, (C) the monies are held in a Deposit Account in which Agent has a perfected first-priority security interest, and (D) Loan Parties complete such repair, restoration or replacement, purchase, or construction within 270 days after the initial receipt of such monies, then the Loan Party whose assets were the subject of such disposition shall have the option to apply such monies to the costs of repair, restoration or replacement of the assets that are the subject of such sale or disposition or the costs of purchase or construction of other assets of such Loan Party useful in the business of such Loan Party unless and to the extent that such applicable period shall have expired without such repair, restoration or replacement, purchase, or construction being made or completed, in which case, any amounts remaining in the Deposit Account referred to in clause (C) above shall be paid to Agent and applied in accordance with Section 2.4(f)(ii).  Nothing contained in this Section 2.4(e)(ii) shall permit Parent or any of its Subsidiariesto sell or otherwise dispose of any assets other than in accordance with Section 6.4.(iii)    Dispositions of Eligible Equipment.

Except as provided in Section 2.6(c), all Loans, and all Obligations (except for undrawn Letters of Credit) that have been charged to the Loan Account pursuant to the terms hereof, shall bear interest as follows:(vii)    if the relevant Obligation is a portion of the Term Loan that is a LIBOR Rate Loan, at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR Rate plus the LIBOR Rate TermMargin,(viii)    if the relevant Obligation is a Revolving Loan that is a LIBOR Rate Loan predicated on the Fixed Asset Availability Amount, at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR Rate plus the LIBOR Rate Margin (Fixed Asset Availability Amount),(ix)    if the relevant Obligation is a Revolving Loan that is a LIBOR Rate Loan not predicated on the Fixed Asset Availability Amount, at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR Rate plus the LIBOR Rate Margin,(x)    if the relevant Obligation is a portion of the Term Loan that is a Base Rate Loan, at a per annum rate equal to the Base Rate plus the Base Rate Term Margin,-19-Exhibit 10.1(xi)    if the relevant Obligation is a Revolving Loan that is a Base Rate Loan predicated on the Fixed Asset Availability Amount, at a per annum rate equal to the Base Rate plus the Base Rate Margin (Fixed Asset Availability Amount), and(xii)    otherwise, at a per annum rate equal to the Base Rate plus the Base Rate Margin.(b)    Letter of Credit Fee.  Borrowers shall pay Agent (for the ratable benefit of the Revolving Lenders), a Letter of Credit fee (the "Letter of Credit Fee") (which fee shall be in addition to the fronting fees and commissions, other fees, charges and expenses set forth in Section 2.11(k)) that shall accrue at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR Rate Margin times the undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit.(c)    Default Rate.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default and at the election of Agent or the Required Lenders,(vii)    all Loans, and Obligations (except for undrawn Letters of Credit) that have been charged to the Loan Account pursuant to the terms hereof, shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to 2 percentage points above the per annum rate otherwise applicable thereunder, and(viii)    the Letter of Credit Fee shall be increased to 2 percentage points above the per annum rate otherwise applicable hereunder.(d)    Payment.  Except to the extent provided to the contrary in Section 2.10, Section 2.11(k) or Section 2.12(a), (i) all interest, all Letter of Credit Fees and all other fees payable hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall be due and payable, in arrears, on the first day of each month and (ii) all costs and expenses payable hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, and all Lender Group Expenses shall be due and payable on the earlier of (x) the first day of the month following the date on which the applicable costs, expenses, or Lender Group Expenses were first incurred or (y) the date on which demand therefor is made by Agent (it being acknowledged and agreed that any charging of such costs, expenses or Lender Group Expenses to the Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of the following sentence shall be deemed to constitute a demand for payment thereof for the purposes of this subclause (y)).  Borrowers hereby authorize Agent, from time to time without prior notice to Borrowers, to charge to the Loan Account (A) on the first day of each month, all interest accrued during the prior month on the Revolving Loans or the Term Loan hereunder, (B) on the first day of each month, all Letter of Credit Fees accrued or chargeable hereunder during the prior month, (C) as and when incurred or accrued, all fees and costs provided for in Section 2.10 (a) or (c), (D) on the first day of each month, the Unused Line Fee accrued during the prior month pursuant to Section 2.10(b), (E) as and when due and payable, all other fees payable hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, (F) as and when incurred or accrued, the fronting fees and all commissions, other fees, charges and expenses provided for in Section 2.11(k), (G) as and when incurred or accrued, all other Lender Group Expenses, and (H) as and when due and payable all other payment obligations payable under any Loan Document or any Bank Product Agreement (including any amounts due and payable to the Bank Product Providers in respect of Bank Products).  All amounts (including interest, fees, costs, expenses, Lender Group -20-Exhibit 10.1Expenses, or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document or under any Bank Product Agreement) charged to the Loan Account shall thereupon constitute Revolving Loans hereunder, shall constitute Obligations hereunder, and shall initially accrue interest at the rate then applicable to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans (unless and until converted into LIBOR Rate Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement).(e)    Computation.  All interest and fees chargeable under the Loan Documents shall be computed on the basis of a 360 day year, in each case, for the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which the interest or fees accrue.  In the event the Base Rate is changed from time to time hereafter, the rates of interest hereunder based upon the Base Rate automatically and immediately shall be increased or decreased by an amount equal to such change in the Base Rate.(f)    Intent to Limit Charges to Maximum Lawful Rate.  In no event shall the interest rate or rates payable under this Agreement, plus any other amounts paid in connection herewith, exceed the highest rate permissible under any law that a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable.  Borrowers and the Lender Group, in executing and delivering this Agreement, intend legally to agree upon the rate or rates of interest and manner of payment stated within it; provided, that, anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if such rate or rates of interest or manner of payment exceeds the maximum allowable under applicable law, then, ipso facto, as of the date of this Agreement, Borrowers are and shall be liable only for the payment of such maximum amount as is allowed by law, and payment received from Borrowers in excess of such legal maximum, whenever received, shall be applied to reduce the principal balance of the Obligations to the extent of such excess.(g)    Obligations Predicated on the Fixed Asset Availability Amount.  For purposes of calculating interest, Revolving Loans shall first, to the extent of the Fixed Asset Availability Amount, be deemed predicated on clause (c) of the definition of Borrowing Base, prior to giving effect to the other components of the Borrowing Base.2.7.    Crediting Payments.  The receipt of any payment item by Agent shall not be required to be considered a payment on account unless such payment item is a wire transfer of immediately available federal funds made to Agent's Account or unless and until such payment item is honored when presented for payment.  Should any payment item not be honored when presented for payment, then Borrowers shall be deemed not to have made such payment and interest shall be calculated accordingly.  Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, any payment item shall be deemed received by Agent only if it is received into Agent's Account on a Business Day on or before 1:30 p.m.  If any payment item is received into Agent's Account on a non-Business Day or after 1:30 p.m. on a Business Day (unless Agent, in its sole discretion, elects to credit it on the date received), it shall be deemed to have been received by Agent as of the opening of business on the immediately following Business Day.2.8.    Designated Account.  Agent is authorized to make the Revolving Loans and the Term Loan, and Issuing Bank is authorized to issue the Letters of Credit, under this Agreement based upon telephonic or other instructions received from anyone purporting to be an Authorized Person or, without instructions, if pursuant to Section 2.6(d).  Borrowers agree to establish and maintain the Designated Account with the Designated Account Bank for the purpose of receiving -21-Exhibit 10.1the proceeds of the Revolving Loans requested by Borrowers and made by Agent or the Lenders hereunder.  Unless otherwise agreed by Agent and Borrowers, any Revolving Loan or Swing Loan requested by Borrowers and made by Agent or the Lenders hereunder shall be made to the Designated Account.2.9.    Maintenance of Loan Account; Statements of Obligations.  Agent shall maintain an account on its books in the name of Borrowers (the "Loan Account") on which Borrowers will be charged with the Term Loan, all Revolving Loans (including Extraordinary Advances and Swing Loans) made by Agent, Swing Lender, or the Lenders to Borrowers or for Borrowers' account, the Letters of Credit issued or arranged by Issuing Bank for Borrowers' account, and with all other payment Obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, including, accrued interest, fees and expenses, and Lender Group Expenses.  In accordance with Section 2.7, the Loan Account will be credited with all payments received by Agent from Borrowers or for Borrowers' account.  Agent shall make available to Borrowers monthly statements regarding the Loan Account, including the principal amount of the Term Loan and the Revolving Loans, interest accrued hereunder, fees accrued or charged hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and a summary itemization of all charges and expenses constituting Lender Group Expenses accrued hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and each such statement, absent manifest error, shall be conclusively presumed to be correct and accurate and constitute an account stated between Borrowers and the Lender Group unless, within 30 days after receipt thereof by Administrative Borrower, Borrowers shall deliver to Agent written objection thereto describing the error or errors contained in such statement.2.10.    Fees.(a)    Agent Fees.  Borrowers shall pay to Agent, for the account of Agent, as and when due and payable under the terms of the Fee Letter, the fees set forth in the Fee Letter.(b)    Unused Line Fee.  Borrowers shall pay to Agent, for the ratable account of the Revolving Lenders, an unused line fee (the "Unused Line Fee") in an amount equal to the Applicable Unused Line Fee Percentage per annum times the result of (i) the aggregate amount of the Revolver Commitments, less (ii) the average amount of the Revolver Usage during the immediately preceding month (or portion thereof), which Unused Line Fee shall be due and payable on the first day of each month from and after the Closing Date up to the first day of the month prior to the date on which the Obligations are paid in full and on the date on which the Obligations are paid in full.(c)    Field Examination and Other Fees.  Borrowers shall pay to Agent, field examination, appraisal, and valuation fees and charges, as and when incurred or chargeable, as follows (i) a fee of $1,000 per day, per examiner, plus out-of-pocket expenses (including travel, meals, and lodging) for each field examination of any Borrower performed by personnel employed by Agent, and (ii) the fees or charges paid or incurred by Agent (including travel, meals, lodging and other out-of-pocket expenses) if it elects to employ the services of one or more third Persons to perform field examinations of Parent or its Subsidiaries, to establish electronic collateral reporting systems, to appraise the Collateral, or any portion thereof, or to assess Parent's or its Subsidiaries' business valuation; provided, that so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and Excess Availability is at least 15% of Maximum Stated Revolver Amount, Borrowers -22-Exhibit 10.1shall not be obligated to reimburse Agent for more than 2 field examinations during any calendar year, more than 1 appraisal of the Inventory during any calendar year or more than 1 appraisal of the Equipment during any calendar year.2.11.    Letters of Credit.(a)    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon the request of Borrowers made in accordance herewith, and prior to the Maturity Date, Issuing Bank agrees to issue a requested Letter of Credit for the account of Borrowers.  By submitting a request to Issuing Bank for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested that Issuing Bank issue the requested Letter of Credit.  Each request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or the amendment, renewal, or extension of any outstanding Letter of Credit, shall be irrevocable and shall be made in writing by an Authorized Person and delivered to Issuing Bank via telefacsimile or other electronic method of transmission reasonably acceptable to Issuing Bank and reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension.  Each such request shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuing Bank and (i) shall specify (A) the amount of such Letter of Credit, (B) the date of issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension of such Letter of Credit, (C) the proposed expiration date of such Letter of Credit, (D) the name and address of the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit, and (E) such other information (including, the conditions to drawing, and, in the case of an amendment, renewal, or extension, identification of the Letter of Credit to be so amended, renewed, or extended) as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew, or extend such Letter of Credit, and (ii) shall be accompanied by such Issuer Documents as Agent or Issuing Bank may request or require, to the extent that such requests or requirements are consistent with the Issuer Documents that Issuing Bank generally requests for Letters of Credit in similar circumstances.  Bank's records of the content of any such request will be conclusive.  Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Issuing Bank may, but shall not be obligated to, issue a Letter of Credit that supports the obligations of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries in respect of (x) a lease of real property to the extent that the face amount of such Letter of Credit exceeds the highest rent (including all rent-like charges) payable under such lease for a period of one year, or (y) an employment contract to the extent that the face amount of such Letter of Credit exceeds the highest compensation payable under such contract for a period of one year.(b)    Issuing Bank shall not issue a Letter of Credit if any of the following would result after giving effect to the requested issuance:(i)    the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed $50,000,000, or(ii)    the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount less the outstanding amount of Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans), or(iii)    the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Borrowing Base at such time less the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans (inclusive of Swing Loans) at such time.(c)    In the event there is a Defaulting Lender as of the date of any request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue or arrange for such -23-Exhibit 10.1Letter of Credit to the extent (i) the Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Exposure with respect to such Letter of Credit may not be reallocated pursuant to Section 2.3(g)(ii), or (ii) the Issuing Bank has not otherwise entered into arrangements reasonably satisfactory to it and Borrowers to eliminate the Issuing Bank's risk with respect to the participation in such Letter of Credit of the Defaulting Lender, which arrangements may include Borrowers cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Exposure in accordance with Section 2.3(g)(ii).  Additionally, Issuing Bank shall have no obligation to issue a Letter of Credit if (A) any order, judgment, or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall, by its terms, purport to enjoin or restrain Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over Issuing Bank shall prohibit or request that Issuing Bank refrain from the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular, or (B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally.(d)    Any Issuing Bank (other than Wells Fargo or any of its Affiliates) shall notify Agent in writing no later than the Business Day immediately following the Business Day on which such Issuing Bank issued any Letter of Credit; provided that (i) until Agent advises any such Issuing Bank that the provisions of Section 3.2 are not satisfied, or (ii) unless the aggregate amount of the Letters of Credit issued in any such week exceeds such amount as shall be agreed by Agent and such Issuing Bank, such Issuing Bank shall be required to so notify Agent in writing only once each week of the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the immediately preceding week as well as the daily amounts outstanding for the prior week, such notice to be furnished on such day of the week as Agent and such Issuing Bank may agree.  Each Letter of Credit shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Issuing Bank, including the requirement that the amounts payable thereunder must be payable in Dollars or such other currency as is acceptable to Agent.  If Issuing Bank makes a payment under a Letter of Credit, Borrowers shall pay to Agent an amount equal to the applicable Letter of Credit Disbursement on the Business Day such Letter of Credit Disbursement is made and, in the absence of such payment, the amount of the Letter of Credit Disbursement immediately and automatically shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder (notwithstanding any failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth in Section 3) and, initially, shall bear interest at the rate then applicable to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans. If a Letter of Credit Disbursement is deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder, Borrowers' obligation to pay the amount of such Letter of Credit Disbursement to Issuing Bank shall be automatically converted into an obligation to pay the resulting Revolving Loan.  Promptly following receipt by Agent of any payment from Borrowers pursuant to this paragraph, Agent shall distribute such payment to Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to Section 2.11(e) to reimburse Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.(e)    Promptly following receipt of a notice of a Letter of Credit Disbursement pursuant to Section 2.11(d), each Revolving Lender agrees to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Revolving Loan deemed made pursuant to Section 2.11(d) on the same terms and conditions as if Borrowers had requested the amount thereof as a Revolving Loan and Agent shall promptly pay to Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment, renewal, or extension of a Letter of Credit) and without any further -24-Exhibit 10.1action on the part of Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have granted to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, a participation in each Letter of Credit issued by Issuing Bank, in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of such Letter of Credit, and each such Revolving Lender agrees to pay to Agent, for the account of Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of any Letter of Credit Disbursement made by Issuing Bank under the applicable Letter of Credit.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to Agent, for the account of Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of each Letter of Credit Disbursement made by Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by Borrowers on the date due as provided in Section 2.11(d), or of any reimbursement payment that is required to be refunded (or that Agent or Issuing Bank elects, based upon the advice of counsel, to refund) to Borrowers for any reason.  Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to deliver to Agent, for the account of Issuing Bank, an amount equal to its respective Pro Rata Share of each Letter of Credit Disbursement pursuant to this Section 2.11(e) shall be absolute and unconditional and such remittance shall be made notwithstanding the occurrence or continuation of an Event of Default or Default or the failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Section 3.  If any such Revolving Lender fails to make available to Agent the amount of such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of a Letter of Credit Disbursement as provided in this Section, such Revolving Lender shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender and Agent (for the account of Issuing Bank) shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate until paid in full.(f)    Each Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each member of the Lender Group (including Issuing Bank and its branches, Affiliates, and correspondents) and each such Person's respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents (each, including Issuing Bank, a "Letter of Credit Related Person") (to the fullest extent permitted by law) from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, investigations, proceedings, liabilities, fines, costs, penalties, and damages, and all reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys, experts, or consultants and all other costs and expenses actually incurred in connection therewith or in connection with the enforcement of this indemnification (as and when they are incurred and irrespective of whether suit is brought), which may be incurred by or awarded against any such Letter of Credit Related Person (other than Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 16) (the "Letter of Credit Indemnified Costs"), and which arise out of or in connection with, or as a result of:(i)    any Letter of Credit or any p

i)    the fraud, forgery or illegal action of parties other than the Letter of Credit Related Person;(ix)    Issuing Bank's performance of the obligations of a confirming institution or entity that wrongfully dishonors a confirmation; or(x)    the acts or omissions, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto governmental or regulatory authority or cause or event beyond the control of the Letter of Credit Related Person;in each case, including that resulting from the Letter of Credit Related Person's own negligence; provided, however, that such indemnity shall not be available to any Letter of Credit Related Person claiming indemnification under clauses (i) through (x) above to the extent that such Letter of Credit Indemnified Costs may be finally determined in a non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Letter of Credit Related Person claiming indemnity.  Borrowers hereby agree to pay the Letter of Credit Related Person claiming indemnity on demand from time to time all amounts owing under this Section 2.11(f).  If and to the extent that the obligations of Borrowers under this Section 2.11(f) are unenforceable for any reason, Borrowers agree to make the maximum contribution to the Letter of Credit Indemnified Costs permissible under applicable law.  This indemnification provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and all Letters of Credit.(g)    The liability of Issuing Bank (or any other Letter of Credit Related Person) under, in connection with or arising out of any Letter of Credit (or pre-advice), regardless of the form or legal grounds of the action or proceeding, shall be limited to direct damages suffered by Borrowers that are caused directly by Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct in (i) honoring a presentation under a Letter of Credit that on its face does not at least substantially comply with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, (ii) failing to honor a presentation under a Letter of Credit that strictly complies with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit or (iii) retaining Drawing Documents presented under a Letter of Credit.  Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have acted with due diligence and reasonable care if Issuing Bank's conduct is in accordance with Standard Letter of Credit Practice or in accordance with this Agreement.  Borrowers' aggregate remedies against Issuing Bank and any Letter of Credit Related Person for wrongfully honoring a presentation under any Letter of Credit or wrongfully retaining honored Drawing Documents shall in no event exceed the aggregate amount paid by Borrowers to Issuing Bank in respect of the honored presentation in connection with such Letter of Credit under Section 2.11(d), -26-Exhibit 10.1plus interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder.  Borrowers shall take action to avoid and mitigate the amount of any damages claimed against Issuing Bank or any other Letter of Credit Related Person, including by enforcing its rights against the beneficiaries of the Letters of Credit.  Any claim by Borrowers under or in connection with any Letter of Credit shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum of (x) the amount (if any) saved by Borrowers as a result of the breach or alleged wrongful conduct complained of; and (y) the amount (if any) of the loss that would have been avoided had Borrowers taken all reasonable steps to mitigate any loss, and in case of a claim of wrongful dishonor, by specifically and timely authorizing Issuing Bank to effect a cure.(h)    Borrowers are responsible for preparing or approving the final text of the Letter of Credit as issued by Issuing Bank, irrespective of any assistance Issuing Bank may provide such as drafting or recommending text or by Issuing Bank's use or refusal to use text submitted by Borrowers.  Borrowers are solely responsible for the suitability of the Letter of Credit for Borrowers' purposes.  With respect to any Letter of Credit containing an "automatic amendment" to extend the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, Issuing Bank, in its sole and absolute discretion, may give notice of nonrenewal of such Letter of Credit and, if Borrowers do not at any time want such Letter of Credit to be renewed, Borrowers will so notify Agent and Issuing Bank at least 15 calendar days before Issuing Bank is required to notify the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any advising bank of such nonrenewal pursuant to the terms of such Letter of Credit.(i)    Borrowers' reimbursement and payment obligations under this Section 2.11 are absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever, including:(i)    any lack of validity, enforceability or legal effect of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement or any term or provision therein or herein;(ii)    payment against presentation of any draft, demand or claim for payment under any Drawing Document that does not strictly comply with the terms of the applicable Letter of Credit or which proves to be fraudulent, forged or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, or which is signed, issued or presented by a Person or a transferee of such Person purporting to be a successor or transferee of the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit;(iii)    Issuing Bank or any of its branches or Affiliates being the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit;(iv)    the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any time against any beneficiary, any assignee of proceeds, Issuing Bank or any other Person;(v)    any other event, circumstance or conduct whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing that might, but for this Section 2.11(i), constitute a legal or equitable defense to or discharge of, or provide a right of set-off against, Parent's or any of its Subsidiaries' reimbursement and other payment obligations and liabilities, arising under, or in connection with, any Letter of Credit, whether against Issuing Bank, the beneficiary or any other Person; or-27-Exhibit 10.1(vi)    the fact that any Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;provided, however, that subject to Section 2.11(g) above, the foregoing shall not release Issuing Bank from such liability to Borrowers as may be finally determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction against Issuing Bank following reimbursement or payment of the obligations and liabilities, including reimbursement and other payment obligations, of Borrowers to Issuing Bank arising under, or in connection with, this Section 2.11 or any Letter of Credit.(j)    Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, Issuing Bank and each other Letter of Credit Related Person (if applicable) shall not be responsible to Borrowers for, and Issuing Bank's rights and remedies against Borrowers and the obligation of Borrowers to reimburse Issuing Bank for each drawing under each Letter of Credit shall not be impaired by:(i)    honor of a presentation under any Letter of Credit that on its face substantially complies with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, even if the Letter of Credit requires strict compliance by the beneficiary;(ii)    honor of a presentation of any Drawing Document that appears on its face to have been signed, presented or issued (A) by any purported successor or transferee of any beneficiary or other Person required to sign, present or issue such Drawing Document or (B) under a new name of the beneficiary;(iii)    acceptance as a draft of any written or electronic demand or request for payment under a Letter of Credit, even if nonnegotiable or not in the form of a draft or notwithstanding any requirement that such draft, demand or request bear any or adequate reference to the Letter of Credit;(iv)    the identity or authority of any presenter or signer of any Drawing Document or the form, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any Drawing Document (other than Issuing Bank's determination that such Drawing Document appears on its face substantially to comply with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit);(v)    acting upon any instruction or request relative to a Letter of Credit or requested Letter of Credit that Issuing Bank in good faith believes to have been given by a Person authorized to give such instruction or request;(vi)    any errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any message, advice or document (regardless of how sent or transmitted) or for errors in interpretation of technical terms or in translation or any delay in giving or failing to give notice to Borrowers;(vii)    any acts, omissions or fraud by, or the insolvency of, any beneficiary, any nominated person or entity or any other Person or any breach of contract between any beneficiary and any Borrower or any of the parties to the underlying transaction to which the Letter of Credit relates;-28-Exhibit 10.1(viii)    assertion or waiver of any provision of the ISP or UCP that primarily benefits an issuer of a letter of credit, including any requirement that any Drawing Document be presented to it at a particular hour or place;(ix)    payment to any paying or negotiating bank (designated or permitted by the terms of the applicable Letter of Credit) claiming that it rightfully honored or is entitled to reimbursement or indemnity under Standard Letter of Credit Practice applicable to it;(x)    acting or failing to act as required or permitted under Standard Letter of Credit Practice applicable to where Issuing Bank has issued, confirmed, advised or negotiated such Letter of Credit, as the case may be;(xi)    honor of a presentation after the expiration date of any Letter of Credit notwithstanding that a presentation was made prior to such expiration date and dishonored by Issuing Bank if subsequently Issuing Bank or any court or other finder of fact determines such presentation should have been honored;(xii)    dishonor of any presentation that does not strictly comply or that is fraudulent, forged or otherwise not entitled to honor; or(xiii)    honor of a presentation that is subsequently determined by Issuing Bank to have been made in violation of international, federal, state or local restrictions on the transaction of business with certain prohibited Persons.(k)    Borrowers shall pay upon demand to Agent for the account of Issuing Bank as non-refundable fees, commissions, and charges (it being acknowledged and agreed that any charging of such fees, commissions, and charges to the Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.6(d) shall be deemed to constitute a demand for payment thereof for the purposes of this Section 2.11(k)):  (i) a fronting fee which shall be imposed by Issuing Bank upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit of .125%per annum of the face amount thereof, plus (ii) any and all other customary commissions, fees and charges then in effect imposed by, and any and all expenses incurred by, Issuing Bank, or by any adviser, confirming institution or entity or other nominated person, relating to Letters of Credit, at the time of issuance of any Letter of Credit and upon the occurrence of any other activity with respect to any Letter of Credit (including transfers, assignments of proceeds, amendments, drawings, renewals or cancellations).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Issuing Bank is a Person other than Wells Fargo, all fronting fees payable in respect of Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank shall be paid by Borrowers immediately upon demand directly to such Issuing Bank for its own account.(l)    If by reason of (x) any Change in Law, or (y) compliance by Issuing Bank or any other member of the Lender Group with any direction, request, or requirement (irrespective of whether having the force of law) of any Governmental Authority or monetary authority including, Regulation D of the Board of Governors as from time to time in effect (and any successor thereto):(i)    any reserve, deposit, or similar requirement is or shall be imposed or modified in respect of any Letter of Credit issued or caused to be issued hereunder or hereby, or-29-Exhibit 10.1(ii)    there shall be imposed on Issuing Bank or any other member of the Lender Group any other condition regarding any Letter of Credit,and the result of the foregoing is to increase, directly or indirectly, the cost to Issuing Bank or any other member of the Lender Group of issuing, making, participating in, or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount receivable in respect thereof, then, and in any such case, Agent may, at any time within a reasonable period after the additional cost is incurred or the amount received is reduced, notify Borrowers, and Borrowers shall pay within 30 days after demand therefor, such amounts as Agent may specify to be necessary to compensate Issuing Bank or any other member of the Lender Group for such additional cost or reduced receipt, together with interest on such amount from the date of such demand until payment in full thereof at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder; provided, that (A) Borrowers shall not be required to provide any compensation pursuant to this Section 2.11(l) for any such amounts incurred more than 180 days prior to the date on which the demand for payment of such amounts is first made to Borrowers, and (B) if an event or circumstance giving rise to such amounts is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.  The determination by Agent of any amount due pursuant to this Section 2.11(l), as set forth in a certificate setting forth the calculation thereof in reasonable detail, shall, in the absence of manifest or demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto.(m)    Unless otherwise expressly agreed by Issuing Bank and Borrowers when a Letter of Credit is issued, (i) the rules of the ISP and UCP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of UCP shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.(n)    In the event of a direct conflict between the provisions of this Section 2.11 and any provision contained in any Issuer Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other.  In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this Section 2.11 shall control and govern.2.12.    LIBOR Option.(a)    Interest and Interest Payment Dates.  In lieu of having interest charged at the rate based upon the Base Rate, Borrowers shall have the option, subject to Section 2.12(b) below (the "LIBOR Option") to have interest on all or a portion of the Revolving Loans or the Term Loan be charged (whether at the time when made (unless otherwise provided herein), upon conversion from a Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR Rate Loan, or upon continuation of a LIBOR Rate Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan) at a rate of interest based upon the LIBOR Rate.  Interest on LIBOR Rate Loans shall be payable on the earliest of (i) the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto; provided, that, subject to the following clauses (ii) and (iii), in the case of any Interest Period greater than 3 months in duration, interest shall be payable at 3 month intervals after the commencement of the applicable Interest Period and on the last day of such Interest Period), (ii) the date on which all or any portion of the Obligations are accelerated pursuant to the terms hereof, or (iii) the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof.  On the last day of each applicable Interest Period, unless Borrowers have properly exercised the LIBOR Option with respect thereto, the interest rate applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan automatically shall convert to the rate of interest then applicable to Base Rate Loans of the same type hereunder.  At any time that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at the written election of Agent or the Required Lenders, Borrowers no longer shall have the option to request that Revolving Loans bear interest at a rate based upon the LIBOR Rate.-30-Exhibit 10.1(b)    LIBOR Election.(i)    Borrowers may, at any time and from time to time, elect to exercise the LIBOR Option by notifying Agent prior to 12:00 noon at least 1 Business Day prior to the commencement of the proposed Interest Period (the "LIBOR Deadline") (provided, that after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Agent may, and at the request of Required Lenders shall, terminate Borrowers' right to exercise the LIBOR Option by providing written notice of such termination to Administrative Borrower).  Notice of Borrowers' election of the LIBOR Option for a permitted portion of the Revolving Loans or the Term Loan and an Interest Period pursuant to this Section shall be made by delivery to Agent of a LIBOR Notice received by Agent before the LIBOR Deadline, or by telephonic notice received by Agent before the LIBOR Deadline (to be confirmed by delivery to Agent of a LIBOR Notice received by Agent prior to 5:00 p.m. on the same day).  Promptly upon its receipt of each such LIBOR Notice, Agent shall provide a copy thereof to each of the affected Lenders.(ii)    Each LIBOR Notice shall be irrevocable and binding on Borrowers.  In connection with each LIBOR Rate Loan, each Borrower shall indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and the Lenders harmless against any loss, cost, or expense actually incurred by Agent or any Lender as a result of (A) the payment of any principal of any LIBOR Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (B) the conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or (C) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBOR Rate Loan on the date specified in any LIBOR Notice delivered pursuant hereto (such losses, costs, or expenses, "Funding Losses").  A certificate of Agent or a Lender delivered to Borrowers setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that Agent or such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Borrowers shall pay such amount to Agent or the Lender, as applicable, within 30 days of the date of its receipt of such certificate.If a payment of a LIBOR Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period would result in a Funding Loss, Agent may, in its sole discretion at the request of Borrowers, hold the amount of such payment as cash collateral in support of the Obligations until the last day of such Interest Period and apply such amounts to the payment of the applicable LIBOR Rate Loan on such last day, it being agreed that Agent has no obligation to so defer the application of payments to any LIBOR Rate Loan and that, in the event that Agent does not defer such application, Borrowers shall be obligated to pay any resulting Funding Losses.(iii)    Unless Agent, in its sole discretion, agrees otherwise, Borrowers shall have not more than 10 LIBOR Rate Loans in effect at any given time.  Borrowers may only exercise the LIBOR Option for proposed LIBOR Rate Loans of at least $1,000,000.(c)    Conversion.  Borrowers may convert LIBOR Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans at any time; provided, that in the event that LIBOR Rate Loans are converted or prepaid on any date that is not the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, including as a result of any prepayment through the required application by Agent of any payments or proceeds of Collateral in accordance with Section 2.4(b) or for any other reason, including early termination of the term of this Agreement, acceleration of all or any portion of the Obligations pursuant to the terms hereof -31-Exhibit 10.1or a required assignment under Section 2.13(b) or 14.2, each Borrower shall indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and the Lenders and their Participants harmless against any and all Funding Losses in accordance with Section 2.12(b)(ii).(d)    Special Provisions Applicable to LIBOR Rate.(i)    The LIBOR Rate may be adjusted by Agent with respect to any Lender on a prospective basis to take into account any additional or increased costs to such Lender of maintaining or obtaining any eurodollar deposits or increased costs (other than Taxes which shall be governed by Section 16), in each case, due to changes in applicable law occurring subsequent to the commencement of the then applicable Interest Period, including any Changes in Law and changes in the reserve requirements imposed by the Board of Governors, which additional or increased costs would increase the cost of funding or maintaining loans bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate.  In any such event, the affected Lender shall give Borrowers and Agent notice of such a determination and adjustment and Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and, upon its receipt of the notice from the affected Lender,  Borrowers may, by notice to such affected Lender (A) require such Lender to furnish to Borrowers a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for adjusting such LIBOR Rate and the method for determining the amount of such adjustment, or (B) repay the LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender with respect to which such adjustment is made (together with any amounts due under Section 2.12(b)(ii)).(ii)    In the event that any change in market conditions or any Change in Law shall at any time after the date hereof, in the reasonable opinion of any Lender, make it unlawful or impractical for such Lender to fund or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans or to continue such funding or maintaining, or to determine or charge interest rates at the LIBOR Rate, such Lender shall give notice of such changed circumstances to Agent and Borrowers and Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and (y) in the case of any LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender that are outstanding, the date specified in such Lender's notice shall be deemed to be the last day of the Interest Period of such LIBOR Rate Loans, and interest upon the LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender thereafter shall accrue interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans, and (z) Borrowers shall not be entitled to elect the LIBOR Option until such Lender determines that it would no longer be unlawful or impractical to do so.(e)    No Requirement of Matched Funding.  Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither Agent, nor any Lender, nor any of their Participants, is required actually to acquire eurodollar deposits to fund or otherwise match fund any Obligation as to which interest accrues at the LIBOR Rate.2.13.    Capital Requirements.(a)    If, after the date hereof, Issuing Bank or any Lender determines that (i) any Change in Law regarding capital or reserve requirements for banks or bank holding companies, or (ii) compliance by Issuing Bank or such Lender, or their respective parent bank holding companies, with any guideline, request or directive of any Governmental Authority regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law), has the effect of reducing the return on Issuing Bank's, such Lender's, or such holding companies' capital as a consequence of Issuing Bank's or such -32-Exhibit 10.1Lender's commitments, Loans participations or other obligations hereunder to a level below that which Issuing Bank, such Lender, or such holding companies could have achieved but for such Change in Law or compliance (taking into consideration Issuing Bank's, such Lender's, or such holding companies' then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy and assuming the full utilization of such entity's capital) by any amount deemed by Issuing Bank or such Lender to be material, then Issuing Bank or such Lender may notify Borrowers and Agent thereof.  Following receipt of such notice, Borrowers agree to pay Issuing Bank or such Lender on demand the amount of such reduction of return of capital as and when such reduction is determined, payable within 30 days after presentation by Issuing Bank or such Lender of a statement in the amount and setting forth in reasonable detail Issuing Bank's or such Lender's calculation thereof and the assumptions upon which such calculation was based (which statement shall be deemed true and correct absent manifest error).  In determining such amount, Issuing Bank or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.  Failure or delay on the part of Issuing Bank or any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of Issuing Bank's or such Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided that Borrowers shall not be required to compensate Issuing Bank or a Lender pursuant to this Section for any reductions in return incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that Issuing Bank or such Lender notifies Borrowers of such Change in Law giving rise to such reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; providedfurther that if such claim arises by reason of the Change in Law that is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.(b)    If Issuing Bank or any Lender requests additional or increased costs referred to in Section 2.11(l) or Section 2.12(d)(i) or amounts under Section 2.13(a) or sends a notice under Section 2.12(d)(ii) relative to changed circumstances (such Issuing Bank or Lender, an "Affected Lender"), then such Affected Lender shall use reasonable efforts to promptly designate a different one of its lending offices or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices or branches, if (i) in the reasonable judgment of such Affected Lender, such designation or assignment would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.11(l), Section 2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a), as applicable, or would eliminate the illegality or impracticality of funding or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans and (ii) in the reasonable judgment of such Affected Lender, such designation or assignment would not subject it to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to it.  Borrowers agree to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by such Affected Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.  If, after such reasonable efforts, such Affected Lender does not so designate a different one of its lending offices or assign its rights to another of its offices or branches so as to eliminate Borrowers' obligation to pay any future amounts to such Affected Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(l), Section 2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a), as applicable, or to enable Borrowers to obtain LIBOR Rate Loans, then Borrowers (without prejudice to any amounts then due to such Affected Lender under Section 2.11(l), Section 2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a), as applicable) may, unless prior to the effective date of any such assignment the Affected Lender withdraws its request for such additional amounts under Section 2.11(l), Section 2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a), as applicable, or indicates that it is no longer unlawful or impractical to fund or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans, may designate a different Issuing Bank or substitute a Lender, in each case,  reasonably acceptable to Agent to purchase the Obligations owed to such Affected Lender and such Affected -33-Exhibit 10.1Lender's commitments hereunder (a "Replacement Lender"), and if such Replacement Lender agrees to such purchase, such Affected Lender shall assign to the Replacement Lender its Obligations and commitments, and upon such purchase by the Replacement Lender, which such Replacement Lender shall be deemed to be "Issuing Bank" or a "Lender" (as the case may be) for purposes of this Agreement and such Affected Lender shall cease to be "Issuing Bank" or a "Lender" (as the case may be) for purposes of this Agreement.(c)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the protection of Sections 2.11(l), 2.12(d), and 2.13 shall be available to Issuing Bank and each Lender (as applicable) regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, judicial ruling, judgment, guideline, treaty or other change or condition which shall have occurred or been imposed, so long as it shall be customary for issuing banks or lenders affected thereby to comply therewith.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, neither Issuing Bank nor any Lender shall demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.13 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of Issuing Bank or such Lender (as the case may be) to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements, if any.2.14.    Inclusion of Foreign Assets in Borrowing Base.  At the written request of Administrative Borrower, the Borrowing Base may be modified to include the Eligible Accounts of a Specified Foreign Subsidiary, but only so long as Agent and all of the Lenders have provided their prior written consent to so including the Eligible Accounts of a Specified Foreign Subsidiary in the Borrowing Base.  Such consent, if given by Agent and the Lenders, may include such conditions as they deem appropriate, including the following:(a)    The eligibility criteria for Eligible Accounts of a Specified Foreign Subsidiary may be modified and additional Reserves may be established;(b)    Each Specified Foreign Subsidiary shall be required to become a Loan Party (and Agent and Lenders shall have received the information and searches described in Section 17.11) and if a Borrower, the interest rate, currency, and borrowing procedures shall be determined by Agent and the Lenders;(c)    Foreign Subsidiaries of Parent may be required to guaranty the Obligations of such Specified Foreign Subsidiary secured by a first priority Lien on the assets of such Foreign Subsidiary;(d)    Parent and its US Subsidiaries shall guaranty the Obligations of each Specified Foreign Subsidiary, and each Specified Foreign Subsidiary shall guaranty the Obligations of each Loan Party unless such Specified Foreign Subsidiary is a CFC and providing such guaranty by such Specified Foreign Subsidiary would result in adverse tax consequences or the costs to the Loan Parties of providing such guaranty or such security agreements are unreasonably excessive (as determined by Agent and Lenders) in relation to the benefits to Agent and the Lenders of the guaranty afforded thereby;(e)    each of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.2 shall have been satisfied; and-34-Exhibit 10.1(f)    Loan Parties shall have executed and delivered such agreements, instruments, documents and opinions as Agent may request to effectuate the forgoing.2.15.    Joint and Several Liability of Borrowers.(a)    Each Borrower is accepting joint and several liability hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in consideration of the financial accommodations to be provided by the Lender Group under this Agreement, for the mutual benefit, directly and indirectly, of each Borrower and in consideration of the undertakings of the other Borrowers to accept joint and several liability for the Obligations.(b)    Each Borrower, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with the other Borrowers, with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations (including any Obligations arising under this Section 2.15), it being the intention of the parties hereto that all the Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of each Borrower without preferences or distinction among them.(c)    If and to the extent that any Borrower shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when due or to perform any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such event the other Borrowers will make such payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligation until such time as all of the Obligations are paid in full.(d)    The Obligations of each Borrower under the provisions of this Section 2.15 constitute the absolute and unconditional, full recourse Obligations of each Borrower enforceable against each Borrower to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the provisions of this Agreement (other than this Section 2.15(d)) or any other circumstances whatsoever.(e)    Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each Borrower hereby waives notice of acceptance of its joint and several liability, notice of any Revolving Loans or Letters of Credit issued under or pursuant to this Agreement, notice of the occurrence of any Default, Event of Default, or of any demand for any payment under this Agreement, notice of any action at any time taken or omitted by Agent or Lenders under or in respect of any of the Obligations, any requirement of diligence or to mitigate damages and, generally, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all demands, notices and other formalities of every kind in connection with this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement).  Each Borrower hereby assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or postponement of the time for the payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any partial payment thereon, any waiver, consent or other action or acquiescence by Agent or Lenders at any time or times in respect of any default by any Borrower in the performance or satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Agreement, any and all other indulgences whatsoever by Agent or Lenders in respect of any of the Obligations, and the taking, addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, at any time or times, of any security for any of the Obligations or the addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, of any Borrower.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower assents to any other action or delay in acting or failure to act on -35-Exhibit 10.1the part of any Agent or Lender with respect to the failure by any Borrower to comply with any of its respective Obligations, including, without limitation, any failure strictly or diligently to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to comply fully with applicable laws or regulations thereunder, which might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.15 afford grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving any Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its Obligations under this Section 2.15, it being the intention of each Borrower that, so long as any of the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the Obligations of each Borrower under this Section 2.15 shall not be discharged except by performance and then only to the extent of such performance.  The Obligations of each Borrower under this Section 2.15 shall not be diminished or rendered unenforceable by any winding up, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation, reconstruction or similar proceeding with respect to any other Borrower or any Agent or Lender.(f)    Each Borrower represents and warrants to Agent and Lenders that such Borrower is currently informed of the financial condition of Borrowers and of all other circumstances which a diligent inquiry would reveal and which bear upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations.  Each Borrower further represents and warrants to Agent and Lenders that such Borrower has read and understands the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents.  Each Borrower hereby covenants that such Borrower will continue to keep informed of Borrowers' financial condition and of all other circumstances which bear upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance of the Obligations.(g)    The provisions of this Section 2.15 are made for the benefit of Agent, each member of the Lender Group, each Bank Product Provider, and their respective successors and assigns, and may be enforced by it or them from time to time against any or all Borrowers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of Agent, any member of the Lender Group, any Bank Product Provider, or any of their successors or assigns first to marshal any of its or their claims or to exercise any of its or their rights against any Borrower or to exhaust any remedies available to it or them against any Borrower or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy.  The provisions of this Section 2.15 shall remain in effect until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full or otherwise fully satisfied.  If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made in respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, or otherwise, the provisions of this Section 2.15 will forthwith be reinstated in effect, as though such payment had not been made.(h)    Each Borrower hereby agrees that it will not enforce any of its rights of contribution or subrogation against any other Borrower with respect to any liability incurred by it hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, any payments made by it to Agent or Lenders with respect to any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor until such time as all of the Obligations have been paid in full in cash.  Any claim which any Borrower may have against any other Borrower with respect to any payments to any Agent or any member of the Lender Group hereunder or under any of the Bank Product Agreements are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment, without limitation as to any increases in the Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full in cash of the Obligations and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding -36-Exhibit 10.1under the laws of any jurisdiction relating to any Borrower, its debts or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full in cash before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any other Borrower therefor.3.CONDITIONS; TERM OF AGREEMENT.3.1.    Conditions Precedent to the Initial Extension of Credit.  The obligation of each Lender to make the initial extensions of credit provided for hereunder is subject to the fulfillment, to the satisfaction of Agent and each Lender, of each of the conditions precedent set forth on Schedule 3.1 (the making of such initial extensions of credit by a Lender being conclusively deemed to be its satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent).3.2.    Conditions Precedent to all Extensions of Credit.  The obligation of the Lender Group (or any member thereof) to make any Revolving Loans hereunder (or to extend any other credit hereunder) at any time shall be subject to the following conditions precedent:(i)    the representations and warranties of Parent or its Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof) on and as of the date of such extension of credit, as though made on and as of such date (except to the extent that such representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof) as of such earlier date); and(j)    no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such extension of credit, nor shall either result from the making thereof.3.3.    Maturity.  This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect for a term ending on the Maturity Date.3.4.    Effect of Maturity.  On the Maturity Date, all commitments of the Lender Group to provide additional credit hereunder shall automatically be terminated and all of the Obligations immediately shall become due and payable without notice or demand and Borrowers shall be required to repay all of the Obligations in full.  No termination of the obligations of the Lender Group (other than payment in full of the Obligations and termination of the Commitments) shall relieve or discharge any Loan Party of its duties, obligations, or covenants hereunder or under any other Loan Document and Agent's Liens in the Collateral shall continue to secure the Obligations and shall remain in effect until all Obligations have been paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated.

Parent will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, at Borrowers' expense, (a) maintain insurance respecting each of Parent's and its Subsidiaries'assets wherever located, covering liabilities, losses or damages as are customarily are insured against by other Persons engaged in same or similar businesses and similarly situated and located.  All such policies of insurance shall be with financially sound and reputable insurance companies reasonably acceptable to Agent and in such amounts as is carried generally in accordance with sound business practice by companies in similar businesses similarly situated and located and, in any event, in amount, adequacy, and scope reasonably satisfactory to Agent (it being agreed that the amount, adequacy, and scope of the policies of insurance of Borrowers in effect as of the Closing Date are acceptable to Agent).  All property insurance policies covering the Collateral are to be made payable to Agent for the benefit of Agent and the Lenders, as their interests may appear, in case of loss, pursuant to a standard loss payable endorsement with a standard noncontributory "lender" or "secured party" clause and are to contain such other provisions as Agent may reasonably require to fully protect the Lenders' interest in the Collateral and to any payments to be made under such policies.

This insurance may, but need not, protect Loan Parties' interests.  The coverage that Agent purchases may, but need not, pay any claim that is made against Loan Parties in connection with the Collateral.

If Agent purchases insurance for the Collateral, as set forth above, Borrowers will be responsible for the costs of that insurance, including interest and any other charges that may be imposed with the placement of the insurance, until the effective date of the cancellation or expiration of the insurance and the costs of the insurance may be added to the principal amount of the Loans owing hereunder.  The costs of such insurance purchased by Agent may be more than the cost of insurance Loan Parties may be able to obtain on their own.  Borrowers shall give Agent prompt notice of any loss exceeding $5,000,000 covered by Significant Parties'casualty or business interruption insurance.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Agent shall have the sole right to file claims under any property and general liability insurance policies in respect of the Collateral, to receive, receipt and give acquittance for any payments that may be payable thereunder, and to execute any and all endorsements, receipts, releases, assignments, reassignments or other documents that may be necessary to effect the collection, compromise or settlement of any claims under any such insurance policies.5.7.    Inspection.(d)    Parent will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, permit Agent, any Lender, and each of their respective duly authorized representatives or agents to visit any of its properties and inspect any of its assets or books and records, to examine and make copies of its books and records, and to discuss its affairs, finances, and accounts with, and to be advised as to the same by, its officers and employees (provided an authorized representative of a Borrower shall -50-Exhibit 10.1be allowed to be present) at such reasonable times and intervals as Agent or any Lender, as applicable, may designate and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, with reasonable prior notice to Borrowers and during regular business hours.(e)    Subject to Section 2.10(c), Parent will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, permit Agent and each of its duly authorized representatives or agents to conduct appraisals and valuations at such reasonable times and intervals as Agent may designate.5.8.    Compliance with Laws.

The Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such Commitments of the assigning Lender pro tanto.(v)    Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks, financial institutions, or other Persons (a "Participant") participating interests in all or any portion of its Obligations, its Commitment, and the other rights and interests of that Lender (the "Originating Lender") hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; provided, that (i) the Originating Lender shall remain a "Lender" for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the Participant receiving the participating interest in the Obligations, the Commitments, and the other rights and interests of the Originating Lender hereunder shall not constitute a "Lender" hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and the Originating Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the Originating Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations, (iii) Borrowers, Agent, and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Originating Lender in connection with the Originating Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (iv) no Lender shall transfer or grant any participating interest under which the Participant has the right to approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except to the extent such amendment to, or consent or waiver with respect to this Agreement or of any other Loan Document would (A) extend the final maturity date of the Obligations hereunder in which such Participant is participating, (B) reduce the interest rate applicable to the Obligations hereunder in which such Participant is participating, (C) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or guaranties (except to the extent expressly provided herein or in any of the Loan Documents) supporting the Obligations hereunder in which such Participant is participating, (D) postpone the payment of, or reduce the amount of, the interest or fees payable to such Participant through such Lender (other than a waiver of default interest), or (E) decrease the amount or postpone the due dates of scheduled principal repayments or prepayments or premiums payable to such Participant through such Lender, (v) no participation shall be sold to a natural person, (vi)  no participation shall be sold to a Loan Party or an Affiliate of a Loan Party, and (vii) all amounts payable by Borrowers hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation, except that, if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement.  The rights of any Participant only shall be derivative through the Originating Lender with whom such Participant participates and no Participant shall have any rights under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any direct rights as to the other Lenders, Agent, Borrowers, the Collateral, or otherwise in respect of the Obligations.  No Participant shall have the right to participate directly in the making of decisions by the Lenders among themselves.-71-Exhibit 10.1(w)    In connection with any such assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation or any grant of a security interest in, or pledge of, its rights under and interest in this Agreement, a Lender may, subject to the provisions of Section 17.9, disclose all documents and information which it now or hereafter may have relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses.(x)    Any other provision in this Agreement notwithstanding, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of its rights under and interest in this Agreement in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Bank or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR §203.24, and such Federal Reserve Bank may enforce such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under applicable law.(y)    Agent (as a non-fiduciary agent on behalf of Borrowers) shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, a register (the "Register") on which it enters the name and address of each Lender as the registered owner of the Term Loan and Revolver Commitments (and the principal amount thereof and stated interest thereon) held by such Lender (each, a "Registered Loan").  Other than in connection with an assignment by a Lender of all or any portion of its portion of the Term Loan and Revolver Commitments to an Affiliate of such Lender or a Related Fund of such Lender (i) a Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be assigned or sold in whole or in part only by registration of such assignment or sale on the Register (and each registered note shall expressly so provide) and (ii) any assignment or sale of all or part of such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by registration of such assignment or sale on the Register, together with the surrender of the registered note, if any, evidencing the same duly endorsed by (or accompanied by a written instrument of assignment or sale duly executed by) the holder of such registered note, whereupon, at the request of the designated assignee(s) or transferee(s), one or more new registered notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the designated assignee(s) or transferee(s).  Prior to the registration of assignment or sale of any Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any evidencing the same), Borrowers shall treat the Person in whose name such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) is registered as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving all payments thereon and for all other purposes, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  In the case of any assignment by a Lender of all or any portion of its Term Loan and Revolver Commitments to an Affiliate of such Lender or a Related Fund of such Lender, and which assignment is not recorded in the Register, the assigning Lender, on behalf of Borrowers, shall maintain a register comparable to the Register.  The Register shall be conclusively presumed to be correct and accurate absent manifest error.(z)    In the event that a Lender sells participations in the Registered Loan, such Lender, as a non-fiduciary agent on behalf of Borrowers, shall maintain (or cause to be maintained) a register on which it enters the name of all participants in the Registered Loans held by it (and the principal amount (and stated interest thereon) of the portion of such Registered Loans that is subject to such participations) (the "Participant Register").  A Registered Loan (and the Registered Note, if any, evidencing the same) may be participated in whole or in part only by registration of such participation on the Participant Register (and each registered note shall expressly so provide).  Any participation of such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be -72-Exhibit 10.1effected only by the registration of such participation on the Participant Register.  The Participant Register shall be conclusively presumed to be correct and accurate absent manifest error.(aa)    Agent shall make a copy of the Register (and each Lender shall make a copy of its Participant Register to the extent it has one) available for review by Borrowers from time to time as Borrowers may reasonably request.13.2.    Successors.  This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of each of the parties; provided, that no Borrower may assign this Agreement or any rights or duties hereunder without the Lenders' prior written consent and any prohibited assignment shall be absolutely void ab initio.  No consent to assignment by the Lenders shall release any Borrower from its Obligations.  A Lender may assign this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and its rights and duties hereunder and thereunder pursuant to Section 13.1 and, except as expressly required pursuant to Section 13.1, no consent or approval by any Loan Party is required in connection with any such assignment.14.AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS.14.1.    Amendments and Waivers.(h)    No amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (other than Bank Product Agreements or the Fee Letter), and no consent with respect to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Lenders (or by Agent at the written request of the Required Lenders) and the Loan Parties that are party thereto and then any such waiver or consent shall be effective, but only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, that no such waiver, amendment, or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all of the Lenders directly affected thereby and all of the Loan Parties that are party thereto, do any of the following:(xiv)    increase the amount of or extend the expiration date of any Commitment of any Lender or amend, modify, or eliminate the last sentence of Section 2.4(c)(i),(xv)    postpone or delay any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees, or other amounts due hereunder or under any other Loan Document,(xvi)    reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest on, any loan or other extension of credit hereunder, or reduce any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document (except (A) in connection with the waiver of applicability of Section 2.6(c) (which waiver shall be effective with the written consent of the Required Lenders, and (B) mandatory prepayments pursuant to Section 2.4(e) may be reduced with the prior written consent of Required Lenders),(xvii)    amend, modify, or eliminate this Section or any provision of this Agreement providing for consent or other action by all Lenders,-73-Exhibit 10.1(xviii)    amend, modify, or eliminate Section 3.1 or 3.2(provided, that a waiver of a Default or Event of Default or an event or circumstance that could give rise to a Default or Event of Default shall not constitute an amendment or modification of Section 3.1 or 3.2),(xix)    amend, modify, or eliminate Section 15.11,(xx)    other than as permitted by Section 15.11, release Agent's Lien in and to any of the Collateral,(xxi)    amend, modify, or eliminate the definitions of "Required Lenders""Supermajority Lenders" or "Pro Rata Share",(xxii)    contractually subordinate any of Agent's Liens other than pursuant to the Note Intercreditor Agreement or in accordance with Section 15.11,(xxiii)    other than in connection with a merger, liquidation, dissolution or sale of such Person expressly permitted by the terms hereof or the other Loan Documents, release any Borrower or any Guarantor from any obligation for the payment of money or consent to the assignment or transfer by any Borrower or any Guarantor of any of its rights or duties under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents,(xxiv)    amend, modify, or eliminate any of the provisions of Section 2.4(b)(i) or (ii), or(xxv)    amend, modify, or eliminate any of the provisions of Section 13.1 with respect to assignments to, or participations with, Persons who are Loan Parties or Affiliates of Loan Parties;(i)    No amendment, waiver, modification, or consent shall amend, modify, waive, or eliminate,(i)    the definition of, or any of the terms or provisions of, the Fee Letter, without the written consent of Agent and Borrowers (and shall not require the written consent of any of the Lenders),(ii)    any provision of Section 15 pertaining to Agent, or any other rights or duties of Agent under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, without the written consent of Agent, Borrowers, and the Required Lenders;(j)    No amendment, waiver, modification, elimination, or consent shall, without written consent of Agent, Borrowers and the Supermajority Lenders, amend, modify or eliminate the definition of Borrowing Base or any of the defined terms (including the definitions of Eligible Accounts, Eligible Inventory, Eligible Equipment, Fixed Asset Sub-Line Amount and Fixed Asset Availability Amount) that are used in such definition to the extent that any such change results in more credit being made available to Borrowers based upon the Borrowing Base, but not otherwise, or the definition of Maximum Revolver Amount;provided, that no Accounts of a Foreign Subsidiary may be included in the Borrowing Base without the prior written consent of all of the Lenders;-74-Exhibit 10.1(k)    No amendment, waiver, modification, elimination, or consent shall amend, modify, or waive any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents pertaining to Issuing Bank, or any other rights or duties of Issuing Bank under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, without the written consent of Issuing Bank, Agent, Borrowers, and the Required Lenders;(l)    No amendment, waiver, modification, elimination, or consent shall amend, modify, or waive any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents pertaining to Swing Lender, or any other rights or duties of Swing Lender under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, without the written consent of Swing Lender, Agent, Borrowers, and the Required Lenders; and(m)    Anything in this Section 14.1 to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) any amendment, modification, elimination, waiver, consent, termination, or release of, or with respect to, any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that relates only to the relationship of the Lender Group among themselves, and that does not affect the rights or obligations of Parent or any Borrower, shall not require consent by or the agreement of any Loan Party, and (ii) any amendment, waiver, modification, elimination, or consent of or with respect to any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be entered into without the consent of, or over the objection of, any Defaulting Lender other than any of the matters governed by Section 14.1(a)(i) through (iii) that affect such Lender.14.2.    Replacement of Certain Lenders.(k)    If (i) any action to be taken by the Lender Group or Agent hereunder requires the consent, authorization, or agreement of all Lenders or all Lenders affected thereby and if such action has received the consent, authorization, or agreement of the Required Lenders but not of all Lenders or all Lenders affected thereby, or (ii) any Lender makes a claim for compensation under Section 16, then Borrowers or Agent, upon at least 5 Business Days prior irrevocable notice, may permanently replace any Lender (and its Affiliates) that failed to give its consent, authorization, or agreement (a "Non-Consenting Lender") or any Lender (and its Affiliates) that made a claim for compensation (a "Tax Lender") with one or more Replacement Lenders, and the Non-Consenting Lender (and its Affiliates) or Tax Lender (and its Affiliates), as applicable, shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder.  Such notice to replace the Non-Consenting Lender (and its Affiliates) or Tax Lender (and its Affiliates), as applicable, shall specify an effective date for such replacement, which date shall not be later than 15 Business Days after the date such notice is given.(l)    Prior to the effective date of such replacement, the Non-Consenting Lender (and its Affiliates) or Tax Lender (and its Affiliates), as applicable, and each Replacement Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance, subject only to the Non-Consenting Lender (and its Affiliates) or Tax Lender (and its Affiliates), as applicable, being repaid in full its share of the outstanding Obligations (without any premium or penalty of any kind whatsoever, but including (i) all interest, fees and other amounts that may be due in payable in respect thereof, and (ii) an assumption of its Pro Rata Share of participations in the Letters of Credit).  If the Non-Consenting Lender (and its Affiliates) or Tax Lender (and its Affiliates), as applicable, shall refuse or fail to execute and deliver any such Assignment and Acceptance prior to the effective date of such -75-Exhibit 10.1replacement, Agent may, but shall not be required to, execute and deliver such Assignment and Acceptance in the name of and on behalf of the Non-Consenting Lender (and its Affiliates) or Tax Lender (and its Affiliates), as applicable, and irrespective of whether Agent executes and delivers such Assignment and Acceptance, the Non-Consenting Lender (and its Affiliates) or Tax Lender (and its Affiliates), as applicable, shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance.  The replacement of any Non-Consenting Lender (and its Affiliates) or Tax Lender (and its Affiliates), as applicable, shall be made in accordance with the terms of Section 13.1.  Until such time as one or more Replacement Lenders shall have acquired all of the Obligations, the Commitments, and the other rights and obligations of the Non-Consenting Lender (and its Affiliates) or Tax Lender (and its Affiliates), as applicable, hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Non-Consenting Lender (and its Affiliates) or Tax Lender (and its Affiliates), as applicable, shall remain obligated to make the Non-Consenting Lender's (and its Affiliates') or Tax Lender's (and its Affiliates'), as applicable, Pro Rata Share of Revolving Loans and to purchase a participation in each Letter of Credit, in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of participations in such Letters of Credit.14.3.    No Waivers; Cumulative Remedies.  No failure by Agent or any Lender to exercise any right, remedy, or option under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or delay by Agent or any Lender in exercising the same, will operate as a waiver thereof.  No waiver by Agent or any Lender will be effective unless it is in writing, and then only to the extent specifically stated.  No waiver by Agent or any Lender on any occasion shall affect or diminish Agent's and each Lender's rights thereafter to require strict performance by Parent and Borrowers of any provision of this Agreement.  Agent's and each Lender's rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents will be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy that Agent or any Lender may have.15.AGENT; THE LENDER GROUP.15.1.    Appointment and Authorization of Agent.  Each Lender hereby designates and appoints Wells Fargo as its agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to designate, appoint, and authorize) Agent to execute and deliver each of the other Loan Documents on its behalf and to take such other action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to Agent by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Agent agrees to act as agent for and on behalf of the Lenders (and the Bank Product Providers) on the conditions contained in this Section 15.  Any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document notwithstanding, Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents, nor shall Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender (or Bank Product Provider), and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against Agent.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term "agent" in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents with reference to Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead, such term is used -76-Exhibit 10.1merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only a representative relationship between independent contracting parties.  Each Lender hereby further authorizes (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to authorize) Agent to act as the secured party under each of the Loan Documents that create a Lien on any item of Collateral.  Except as expressly otherwise provided in this Agreement, Agent shall have and may use its sole discretion with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any discretionary rights or taking or refraining from taking any actions that Agent expressly is entitled to take or assert under or pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, or of any other provision of the Loan Documents that provides rights or powers to Agent, Lenders agree that Agent shall have the right to exercise the following powers as long as this Agreement remains in effect:  (a) maintain, in accordance with its customary business practices, ledgers and records reflecting the status of the Obligations, the Collateral, payments and proceeds of Collateral, and related matters, (b) execute or file any and all financing or similar statements or notices, amendments, renewals, supplements, documents, instruments, proofs of claim, notices and other written agreements with respect to the Loan Documents, (c) make Revolving Loans, for itself or on behalf of Lenders, as provided in the Loan Documents, (d) exclusively receive, apply, and distribute payments and proceeds of the Collateral as provided in the Loan Documents, (e) open and maintain such bank accounts and cash management arrangements as Agent deems necessary and appropriate in accordance with the Loan Documents for the foregoing purposes, (f) perform, exercise, and enforce any and all other rights and remedies of the Lender Group with respect to Parent or its Subsidiaries, the Obligations, the Collateral, or otherwise related to any of same as provided in the Loan Documents, and (g) incur and pay such Lender Group Expenses as Agent may deem necessary or appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its functions and powers pursuant to the Loan Documents.15.2.    Delegation of Duties.  Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys in fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.  Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney in fact that it selects as long as such selection was made without gross negligence or willful misconduct.15.3.    Liability of Agent.  None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders (or Bank Product Providers) for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any officer or director thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of Parent or its Subsidiaries or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.  No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lenders (or Bank Product Providers) to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the books and records or properties -77-Exhibit 10.1of Parent or its Subsidiaries.15.4.    Reliance by Agent.  Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, telefacsimile or other electronic method of transmission, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Loan Parties or counsel to any Lender), independent accountants and other experts selected by Agent.  Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless Agent shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Lenders as it deems appropriate and until such instructions are received, Agent shall act, or refrain from acting, as it deems advisable.  If Agent so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders (and, if it so elects, the Bank Product Providers) against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders (and Bank Product Providers).15.5.    Notice of Default or Event of Default.  Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest, fees, and expenses required to be paid to Agent for the account of the Lenders and, except with respect to Events of Default of which Agent has actual knowledge, unless Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or Borrowers referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default, and stating that such notice is a "notice of default."  Agent promptly will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice or of any Event of Default of which Agent has actual knowledge.  If any Lender obtains actual knowledge of any Event of Default, such Lender promptly shall notify the other Lenders and Agent of such Event of Default.  Each Lender shall be solely responsible for giving any notices to its Participants, if any.  Subject to Section 15.4, Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Required Lenders in accordance with Section 9; provided, that unless and until Agent has received any such request, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable.15.6.    Credit Decision.  Each Lender (and Bank Product Provider) acknowledges that none of the Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of Parent and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender (or Bank Product Provider).  Each Lender represents (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to represent) to Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such due diligence, documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of each Borrower or any other Person party to a Loan Document, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this -78-Exhibit 10.1Agreement and to extend credit to Borrowers.  Each Lender also represents (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to represent) that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of each Borrower or any other Person party to a Loan Document.  Except for notices, reports, and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by Agent, Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender (or Bank Product Provider) with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any Borrower or any other Person party to a Loan Document that may come into the possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.  Each Lender acknowledges (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to acknowledge) that Agent does not have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis (except to the extent, if any, that is expressly specified herein) to provide such Lender (or Bank Product Provider) with any credit or other information with respect to any Borrower, its Affiliates or any of their respective business, legal, financial or other affairs, and irrespective of whether such information came into Agent's or its Affiliates' or representatives' possession before or after the date on which such Lender became a party to this Agreement (or such Bank Product Provider entered into a Bank Product Agreement).15.7.    Costs and Expenses; Indemnification.  Agent may incur and pay Lender Group Expenses to the extent Agent reasonably deems necessary or appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its functions, powers, and obligations pursuant to the Loan Documents, including court costs, attorneys' fees and expenses, fees and expenses of financial accountants, advisors, consultants, and appraisers, costs of collection by outside collection agencies, auctioneer fees and expenses, and costs of security guards or insurance premiums paid to maintain the Collateral, whether or not Borrowers are obligated to reimburse Agent or Lenders for such expenses pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.  Agent is authorized and directed to deduct and retain sufficient amounts from payments or proceeds of the Collateral received by Agent to reimburse Agent for such out-of-pocket costs and expenses prior to the distribution of any amounts to Lenders (or Bank Product Providers).  In the event Agent is not reimbursed for such costs and expenses by Parent or its Subsidiaries, each Lender hereby agrees that it is and shall be obligated to pay to Agent such Lender's ratable thereof.  Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each of the Lenders, on a ratable basis, shall indemnify and defend the Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of Borrowers to do so) from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities; provided, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person (or its officers, directors, employees, attorneys or agents) nor shall any Lender be liable for the obligations of any Defaulting Lender in failing to make a Revolving Loan or other extension of credit hereunder.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse Agent upon demand for such Lender's ratable share of any costs or out of pocket expenses (including attorneys, accountants, advisors, and consultants fees and expenses) incurred by Agent in connection with the preparation, -79-Exhibit 10.1execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment, or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the extent that Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of Borrowers.  The undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of Agent.15.8.    Agent in Individual Capacity.  Wells Fargo and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, provide Bank Products to, acquire Equity Interests in, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting, or other business with Parent and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any other Person party to any Loan Document as though Wells Fargo were not Agent hereunder, and, in each case, without notice to or consent of the other members of the Lender Group.  The other members of the Lender Group acknowledge (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to acknowledge) that, pursuant to such activities, Wells Fargo or its Affiliates may receive information regarding Parent or its Affiliates or any other Person party to any Loan Documents that is subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of Parent or such other Person and that prohibit the disclosure of such information to the Lenders (or Bank Product Providers), and the Lenders acknowledge (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to acknowledge) that, in such circumstances (and in the absence of a waiver of such confidentiality obligations, which waiver Agent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain), Agent shall not be under any obligation to provide such information to them.

Agent may resign as Agent upon 30 days (10 days if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) prior written notice to the Lenders (unless such notice is waived by the Required Lenders) and Borrowers (unless such notice is waived by Borrowers or an Event of Default exists) and without any notice to the Bank Product Providers.  If Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall be entitled, with (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) the consent of Borrowers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned), appoint a successor Agent for the Lenders (and the Bank Product Providers).  If, at the time that Agent's resignation is effective, it is acting as Issuing Bank or the Swing Lender, such resignation shall also operate to effectuate its resignation as Issuing Bank or the Swing Lender, as applicable, and it shall automatically be relieved of any further obligation to issue Letters of Credit, or to make Swing Loans.  If no successor Agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of Agent, Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and Borrowers, a successor Agent from among Lenders (unless no Lender is willing to accept such appointment).  If Agent has materially breached or failed to perform any material provision of this Agreement or of applicable law, the Required Lenders may agree in writing to remove and replace Agent with a successor Agent from among the Lenders with (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) the consent of Borrowers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned).  In any such event, upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor Agent hereunder, such successor Agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers, and duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor Agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers, and duties as Agent shall be terminated.  After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 15 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken -80-Exhibit 10.1or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.  If no successor Agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above.15.10.    Lender in Individual Capacity.

The Loan Parties and the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to authorize) Agent, based upon the instruction of the Required Lenders, to (a) consent to, credit bid or purchase (either directly or indirectly through one or more entities) all or any portion of the Collateral at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) credit bid or purchase (either directly or indirectly through one or more entities) all or any portion of the Collateral at any sale or other disposition thereof conducted under the provisions of the Code, including pursuant to Sections 9 610 or 9 620 of the Code, or (c) credit bid or purchase (either directly or indirectly through one or more entities) all or any portion of the Collateral at any other sale or foreclosure conducted or consented to by Agent in accordance with applicable law in any judicial action or proceeding or by the exercise of any legal or equitable remedy.  In connection -81-Exhibit 10.1with any such credit bid or purchase, (i) the Obligations owed to the Lenders and the Bank Product Providers shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims being estimated for such purpose if the fixing or liquidation thereof would not impair or unduly delay the ability of Agent to credit bid or purchase at such sale or other disposition of the Collateral and, if such contingent or unliquidated claims cannot be estimated without impairing or unduly delaying the ability of Agent to credit bid at such sale or other disposition, then such claims shall be disregarded, not credit bid, and not entitled to any interest in the Collateral that is the subject of such credit bid or purchase) and the Lenders and the Bank Product Providers whose Obligations are credit bid shall be entitled to receive interests (ratably based upon the proportion of their Obligations credit bid in relation to the aggregate amount of Obligations so credit bid) in the Collateral that is the subject of such credit bid or purchase (or in the Equity Interests of the any entities that are used to consummate such credit bid or purchase), and (ii) Agent, based upon the instruction of the Required Lenders, may accept non-cash consideration, including debt and equity securities issued by any entities used to consummate such credit bid or purchase and in connection therewith Agent may reduce the Obligations owed to the Lenders and the Bank Product Providers (ratably based upon the proportion of their Obligations credit bid in relation to the aggregate amount of Obligations so credit bid) based upon the value of such non-cash consideration.  Except as provided above, Agent will not execute and deliver a release of any Lien on any Collateral without the prior written authorization of (y) if the release is of all or substantially all of the Collateral, all of the Lenders (without requiring the authorization of the Bank Product Providers), or (z) otherwise, the Required Lenders (without requiring the authorization of the Bank Product Providers).  Upon request by Agent or Borrowers at any time, the Lenders will (and if so requested, the Bank Product Providers will) confirm in writing Agent's authority to release any such Liens on particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 15.11; provided, that (1) anything to the contrary contained in any of the Loan Documents notwithstanding, Agent shall not be required to execute any document or take any action necessary to evidence such release on terms that, in Agent's opinion, could expose Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Lien without recourse, representation, or warranty, and (2) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly released) upon (or obligations of Borrowers in respect of) any and all interests retained by any Borrower, including, the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.  Each Lender further hereby irrevocably authorizes (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to irrevocably authorize) Agent, at its option and in its sole discretion, to subordinate any Lien granted to or held by Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Permitted Lien on such property if such Permitted Lien secures Permitted Purchase Money Indebtedness.  Each Lender further irrevocably authorizes Agent to enter into the Note Intercreditor Agreement and perform obligations thereunder.(b)    Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any of the Lenders (or the Bank Product Providers) (i) to verify or assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by Parent or its Subsidiaries or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, (ii) to verify or assure that Agent's Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, (iii) to verify or assure that any particular items of Collateral meet the eligibility criteria applicable in respect thereof, (iv) to impose, maintain, increase, reduce, implement, or eliminate any particular reserve hereunder or to determine whether -82-Exhibit 10.1the amount of any reserve is appropriate or not, or (v) to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or available to Agent pursuant to any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission, or event related thereto, subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion given Agent's own interest in the Collateral in its capacity as one of the Lenders and that Agent shall have no other duty or liability whatsoever to any Lender (or Bank Product Provider) as to any of the foregoing, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.(c)    In the event Equity Interests of a Loan Party are sold in a Permitted Scheduled Disposition, Agent is authorized by Lenders to release such Person as a Loan Party.15.12.    Restrictions on Actions by Lenders; Sharing of Payments.(a)    Each of the Lenders agrees that it shall not, without the express written consent of Agent, and that it shall, to the extent it is lawfully entitled to do so, upon the written request of Agent, set off against the Obligations, any amounts owing by such Lender to Parent or its Subsidiaries or any deposit accounts of Parent or its Subsidiaries now or hereafter maintained with such Lender.  Each of the Lenders further agrees that it shall not, unless specifically requested to do so in writing by Agent, take or cause to be taken any action, including, the commencement of any legal or equitable proceedings to enforce any Loan Document against any Borrower or any Guarantor or to foreclose any Lien on, or otherwise enforce any security interest in, any of the Collateral.(b)    If, at any time or times any Lender shall receive (i) by payment, foreclosure, setoff, or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any payments with respect to the Obligations, except for any such proceeds or payments received by such Lender from Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) payments from Agent in excess of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of all such distributions by Agent, such Lender promptly shall (A) turn the same over to Agent, in kind, and with such endorsements as may be required to negotiate the same to Agent, or in immediately available funds, as applicable, for the account of all of the Lenders and for application to the Obligations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement, or (B) purchase, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in the Obligations owed to the other Lenders so that such excess payment received shall be applied ratably as among the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares; provided, that to the extent that such excess payment received by the purchasing party is thereafter recovered from it, those purchases of participations shall be rescinded in whole or in part, as applicable, and the applicable portion of the purchase price paid therefor shall be returned to such purchasing party, but without interest except to the extent that such purchasing party is required to pay interest in connection with the recovery of the excess payment.15.13.    Agency for Perfection.  Agent hereby appoints each other Lender (and each Bank Product Provider) as its agent (and each Lender hereby accepts (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to accept) such appointment) for the purpose of perfecting Agent's Liens in assets which, in accordance with Article 8 or Article 9, as applicable, of the Code can be perfected by possession or control.  Should any Lender obtain -83-Exhibit 10.1possession or control of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify Agent thereof, and, promptly upon Agent's request therefor shall deliver possession or control of such Collateral to Agent or in accordance with Agent's instructions.15.14.    Payments by Agent to the Lenders.  All payments to be made by Agent to the Lenders (or Bank Product Providers) shall be made by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to such wire transfer instructions as each party may designate for itself by written notice to Agent.  Concurrently with each such payment, Agent shall identify whether such payment (or any portion thereof) represents principal, premium, fees, or interest of the Obligations.15.15.    Concerning the Collateral and Related Loan Documents.  Each member of the Lender Group authorizes and directs Agent to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Each member of the Lender Group agrees (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to agree) that any action taken by Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents relating to the Collateral and the exercise by Agent of its powers set forth therein or herein, together with such other powers that are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be binding upon all of the Lenders (and such Bank Product Provider).15.16.    Field Examination Reports; Confidentiality; Disclaimers by Lenders; Other Reports and Information.

Notwithstanding that certain of the Loan Documents now or hereafter may have been or will be executed only by or in favor of Agent in its capacity as such, and not by or in favor of the Lenders, any and all obligations on the part of Agent (if any) to make any credit available hereunder shall constitute the several (and not joint) obligations of the respective Lenders on a ratable basis, according to their respective Commitments, to make an amount of such credit not to exceed, in principal amount, at any one time outstanding, the amount of their respective Commitments.  Nothing contained herein shall confer upon any Lender any interest in, or subject any Lender to any liability for, or in respect of, the business, assets, profits, losses, or liabilities of any other Lender.  Each Lender shall be solely responsible for notifying its Participants of any matters relating to the Loan Documents to the extent any such notice may be required, and no Lender shall have any obligation, duty, or liability to any Participant of any other Lender.  Except as provided in Section 15.7, no member of the Lender Group shall have any liability for the acts of any other member of the Lender Group.  No Lender shall be responsible to any Borrower or any other Person for any failure by any other Lender (or Bank Product Provider) to fulfill its obligations to make credit available hereunder, nor to advance for such Lender (or Bank Product Provider) or on its behalf, nor to take any other action on behalf of such Lender (or Bank Product Provider) hereunder or in connection with the financing contemplated herein.15.18.    Titles.

Each Lender and each Participant shall provide new forms (or successor forms) upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered forms and to promptly notify Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.(d)    If a Lender or Participant claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax and such Lender or Participant sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of Borrowers to such Lender or Participant, such Lender or Participant agrees to notify Agent (or, in the case of a sale of a participation interest, to the Lender granting the participation only) of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner of Obligations of Borrowers to such Lender or Participant.  To the extent of such percentage amount, Agent will treat such Lender's or such Participant's documentation provided pursuant to Section 16.2(a) or 16.2(c) as no longer valid.  With respect to such percentage amount, such Participant or Assignee may provide new documentation, pursuant to Section 16.2(a) or 16.2(c), if applicable.

If the forms or other documentation required by Section 16.2(a) or 16.2(c) are not delivered to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation), then Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation) may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender or such Participant not providing such forms or other documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.(b)    If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation) did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender or any Participant due to a failure on the part of the Lender or any Participant (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify Agent (or such Participant failed to notify the Lender granting the participation) of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Lender shall indemnify and hold Agent harmless (or, in the case of a Participant, such Participant shall indemnify and hold the Lender granting the participation harmless) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation), as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) under this Section 16, together with all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses).  The obligation of the Lenders and the Participants under this subsection shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of Agent.16.4.    Refunds.  If Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes to which Borrowers have paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 16, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, it shall pay over such refund to Borrowers (but only to the extent of payments made, or additional amounts paid, by Borrowers under this Section 16 with respect to Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such a refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the applicable Governmental Authority with respect to such a refund); provided, that Borrowers, upon the request of Agent or such Lender, agree to repay the amount paid over to Borrowers (plus any penalties, interest or other charges, imposed by the applicable Governmental Authority, other than such penalties, interest or other charges imposed as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Agent hereunder) to Agent or such Lender in the event Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 16 shall not be construed to require Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information which it deems confidential) to Borrowers or any other Person.17.GENERAL PROVISIONS.-88-Exhibit 10.117.1.    Effectiveness.  This Agreement shall be binding and deemed effective when executed by Parent, each Borrower, Agent, and each Lender whose signature is provided for on the signature pages hereof.17.2.    Section Headings.  Headings and numbers have been set forth herein for convenience only.  Unless the contrary is compelled by the context, everything contained in each Section applies equally to this entire Agreement.17.3.    Interpretation.  Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be construed against the Lender Group or Parent or any Borrower, whether under any rule of construction or otherwise.  On the contrary, this Agreement has been reviewed by all parties and shall be construed and interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the words used so as to accomplish fairly the purposes and intentions of all parties hereto.17.4.    Severability of Provisions.  Each provision of this Agreement shall be severable from every other provision of this Agreement for the purpose of determining the legal enforceability of any specific provision.17.5.    Bank Product Providers.  Each Bank Product Provider in its capacity as such shall be deemed a third party beneficiary hereof and of the provisions of the other Loan Documents for purposes of any reference in a Loan Document to the parties for whom Agent is acting.  Agent hereby agrees to act as agent for such Bank Product Providers and, by virtue of entering into a Bank Product Agreement, the applicable Bank Product Provider shall be automatically deemed to have appointed Agent as its agent and to have accepted the benefits of the Loan Documents.  It is understood and agreed that the rights and benefits of each Bank Product Provider under the Loan Documents consist exclusively of such Bank Product Provider's being a beneficiary of the Liens and security interests (and, if applicable, guarantees) granted to Agent and the right to share in payments and collections out of the Collateral as more fully set forth herein. In addition, each Bank Product Provider, by virtue of entering into a Bank Product Agreement, shall be automatically deemed to have agreed that Agent shall have the right, but shall have no obligation, to establish, maintain, relax, or release reserves in respect of the Bank Product Obligations and that if reserves are established there is no obligation on the part of Agent to determine or insure whether the amount of any such reserve is appropriate or not.  In connection with any such distribution of payments or proceeds of Collateral, Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due or owing to any Bank Product Provider unless such Bank Product Provider has provided a written certification (setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation) to Agent as to the amounts that are due and owing to it and such written certification is received by Agent a reasonable period of time prior to the making of such distribution.  Agent shall have no obligation to calculate the amount due and payable with respect to any Bank Products, but may rely upon the written certification of the amount due and payable from the applicable Bank Product Provider.  In the absence of an updated certification, Agent shall be entitled to assume that the amount due and payable to the applicable Bank Product Provider is the amount last certified to Agent by such Bank Product Provider as being due and payable (less any distributions made to such Bank Product Provider on account thereof).  Borrowers may obtain Bank Products from any Bank Product Provider, although Borrowers are not required to do so.  Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that no Bank Product Provider has committed to provide any Bank Products and that the providing of Bank Products by any Bank Product Provider -89-Exhibit 10.1is in the sole and absolute discretion of such Bank Product Provider.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, no provider or holder of any Bank Product shall have any voting or approval rights hereunder (or be deemed a Lender) solely by virtue of its status as the provider or holder of such agreements or products or the Obligations owing thereunder, nor shall the consent of any such provider or holder be required (other than in their capacities as Lenders, to the extent applicable) for any matter hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, including as to any matter relating to the Collateral or the release of Collateral or Guarantors.17.6.    Debtor-Creditor Relationship.  The relationship between the Lenders and Agent, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other hand, is solely that of creditor and debtor.  No member of the Lender Group (or any Affiliate thereof) has (or shall be deemed to have) any fiduciary relationship or duty to any Loan Party or its stockholders or Affiliates arising out of or in connection with the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, and there is no agency or joint venture relationship between the members of the Lender Group, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties or its stockholders or Affiliates, on the other hand, by virtue of any Loan Document or any transaction contemplated therein.Each Loan Party agrees that it will not claim that any member of the Lender Group has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such Loan Party, in connection with any Loan Document or the process leading to the execution and delivery thereof.17.7.    Counterparts; Electronic Execution.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile or other electronic method of transmission shall be equally as effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement.  Any party delivering an executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile or other electronic method of transmission also shall deliver an original executed counterpart of this Agreement but the failure to deliver an original executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and binding effect of this Agreement.  The foregoing shall apply to each other Loan Document mutatis mutandis.17.8.    Revival and Reinstatement of Obligations; Certain Waivers.If any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider repays, refunds, restores, or returns in whole or in part, any payment or property (including any proceeds of Collateral) previously paid or transferred to such member of the Lender Group or such Bank Product Provider in full or partial satisfaction of any Obligation or on account of any other obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document or any Bank Product Agreement, because the payment, transfer, or the incurrence of the obligation so satisfied is asserted or declared to be void, voidable, or otherwise recoverable under any law relating to creditors' rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code relating to fraudulent transfers, preferences, or other voidable or recoverable obligations or transfers (each, a "Voidable Transfer"), or because such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider elects to do so on the reasonable advice of its counsel in connection with a claim that the payment, transfer, or incurrence is or may be a Voidable Transfer, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount thereof that such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider elects to repay, restore, or return (including pursuant to a settlement of any claim in respect thereof), and as to all reasonable -90-Exhibit 10.1costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees of such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider related thereto, (i) the liability of the Loan Parties with respect to the amount or property paid, refunded, restored, or returned will automatically and immediately be revived, reinstated, and restored and will exist and (ii) Agent's Liens securing such liability shall be effective, revived, and remain in full force and effect, in each case, as fully as if such Voidable Transfer had never been made.  If, prior to any of the foregoing, (A) Agent's Liens shall have been released or terminated or (B) any provision of this Agreement shall have been terminated or cancelled, Agent's Liens, or such provision of this Agreement, shall be reinstated in full force and effect and such prior release, termination, cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligation of any Loan Party in respect of such liability or any Collateral securing such liability.  This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment in full of the Obligations.17.9.    Confidentiality.(d)    Agent and Lenders each individually (and not jointly or jointly and severally) agree that material, non-public information regarding Parent and its Subsidiaries, their operations, assets, and existing and contemplated business plans ("Confidential Information") shall be treated by Agent and the Lenders in a confidential manner, and shall not be disclosed by Agent and the Lenders to Persons who are not parties to this Agreement, except:  (i) to attorneys for and other advisors, accountants, auditors, and consultants to any member of the Lender Group  and to employees, directors and officers of any member of the Lender Group (the Persons in this clause (i), "Lender Group Representatives") on a "need to know" basis in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and on a confidential basis, (ii) to Subsidiaries and Affiliates of any member of the Lender Group (including the Bank Product Providers), provided that any such Subsidiary or Affiliate shall have agreed to receive such information hereunder subject to the terms of this Section 17.9, (iii) as may be required by regulatory authorities so long as such authorities are informed of the confidential nature of such information, (iv) as may be required by statute, decision, or judicial or administrative order, rule, or regulation; provided that (x) prior to any disclosure under this clause (iv), the disclosing party agrees to provide Borrowers with prior notice thereof, to the extent that it is practicable to do so and to the extent that the disclosing party is permitted to provide such prior notice to Borrowers pursuant to the terms of the applicable statute, decision, or judicial or administrative order, rule, or regulation and (y) any disclosure under this clause (iv) shall be limited to the portion of the Confidential Information as may be required by such statute, decision, or judicial or administrative order, rule, or regulation, (v) as may be agreed to in advance in writing by Borrowers, (vi) as requested or required by any Governmental Authority pursuant to any subpoena or other legal process, provided, that, (x) prior to any disclosure under this clause (vi) the disclosing party agrees to provide Borrowers with prior written notice thereof, to the extent that it is practicable to do so and to the extent that the disclosing party is permitted to provide such prior written notice to Borrowers pursuant to the terms of the subpoena or other legal process and (y) any disclosure under this clause (vi) shall be limited to the portion of the Confidential Information as may be required by such Governmental Authority pursuant to such subpoena or other legal process, (vii) as to any such information that is or becomes generally available to the public (other than as a result of prohibited disclosure by Agent or the Lenders or the Lender Group Representatives), (viii) in connection with any assignment, participation  or pledge of any Lender's -91-Exhibit 10.1interest under this Agreement, provided that prior to receipt of Confidential Information any such assignee, participant, or pledgee shall have agreed in writing to receive such Confidential Information either subject to the terms of this Section 17.9 or pursuant to confidentiality requirements substantially similar to those contained in this Section 17.9 (and such Person may disclose such Confidential Information to Persons employed or engaged by them as described in clause (i) above), (ix) in connection with any litigation or other adversary proceeding involving parties hereto which such litigation or adversary proceeding involves claims related to the rights or duties of such parties under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided, that, prior to any disclosure to any Person (other than any Loan Party, Agent, any Lender, any of their respective Affiliates, or their respective counsel) under this clause (ix) with respect to litigation involving any Person (other than any Borrower, Agent, any Lender, any of their respective Affiliates, or their respective counsel), the disclosing party agrees to provide Borrowers with prior written notice thereof, and (x) in connection with, and to the extent reasonably necessary for, the exercise of any secured creditor remedy under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document.(e)    Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Agent and Lenders may disclose information concerning the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to loan syndication and pricing reporting services or in its marketing or promotional materials, with such information to consist of deal terms and other information customarily found in such publications or marketing or promotional materials and may otherwise use the name, logos, and other insignia of any Borrower or the other Loan Parties and the Commitments provided hereunder in any "tombstone" or other advertisements, on its website or in other marketing materials.(f)    The Loan Parties hereby acknowledge that Agent or its Affiliates may make available to the Lenders materials or information provided by or on behalf of Borrowers hereunder (collectively, "Borrower Materials") by posting Borrower Materials on IntraLinks, SyndTrak or another similar electronic system (the "Platform") and certain of the Lenders may be "public-side" Lenders (i.e., Lenders that do not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to the Loan Parties or their securities) (each, a "Public Lender").  The Loan Parties shall be deemed to have authorized Agent and its Affiliates and the Lenders to treat Borrower Materials marked "PUBLIC" or otherwise at any time filed with the SEC as not containing any material non-public information with respect to the Loan Parties or their securities for purposes of United States federal and state securities laws.  All Borrower Materials marked "PUBLIC" are permitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform designated as "Public Investor" (or another similar term).  Agent and its Affiliates and the Lenders shall be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials that are not marked "PUBLIC" or that are not at any time filed with the SEC as being suitable only for posting on a portion of the Platform not marked as "Public Investor" (or such other similar term).17.10.    Survival.  All representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that Agent, Issuing Bank, or any Lender -92-Exhibit 10.1may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of, or any accrued interest on, any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding or unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or been terminated.17.11.    Patriot Act.  Each Lender that is subject to the requirements of the Patriot Act hereby notifies Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Borrower, which information includes the name and address of each Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify each Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act.  In addition, if Agent is required by law or regulation or internal policies to do so, it shall have the right to periodically conduct (a) Patriot Act searches, OFAC/PEP searches, and customary individual background checks for the Loan Parties and (b) OFAC/PEP searches and customary individual background checks for the Loan Parties' senior management and key principals, and each Borrower agrees to cooperate in respect of the conduct of such searches and further agrees that the reasonable costs and charges for such searches shall constitute Lender Group Expenses hereunder and be for the account of Borrowers.17.12.    Integration.  This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, reflects the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not be contradicted or qualified by any other agreement, oral or written, before the date hereof.  The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, all Bank Product Agreements, if any, are independent agreements governed by the written provisions of such Bank Product Agreements, which will remain in full force and effect, unaffected by any repayment, prepayments, acceleration, reduction, increase, or change in the terms of any credit extended hereunder, except as otherwise expressly provided in such Bank Product Agreement.17.13.    Chiquita Brands as Agent for Borrowers.  Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Chiquita Brands as the borrowing agent and attorney-in-fact for all Borrowers (the "Administrative Borrower") which appointment shall remain in full force and effect unless and until Agent shall have received prior written notice signed by each Borrower that such appointment has been revoked and that another Borrower has been appointed Administrative Borrower.  Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Borrower (a) to provide Agent with all notices with respect to Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit obtained for the benefit of any Borrower and all other notices and instructions under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (and any notice or instruction provided by Administrative Borrower shall be deemed to be given by Borrowers hereunder and shall bind each Borrower), (b) to receive notices and instructions from members of the Lender Group (and any notice or instruction provided by any member of the Lender Group to the Administrative Borrower in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been given to each Borrower), and (c) to take such action as the Administrative Borrower deems appropriate on its behalf to obtain Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit and to exercise such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.  It is understood that the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral in a combined fashion, as more fully set forth herein, is done solely as an accommodation to Borrowers in order to utilize the collective borrowing powers of Borrowers in the most efficient and economical manner and at their request, and that Lender Group shall not incur liability to any -93-Exhibit 10.1Borrower as a result hereof.  Each Borrower expects to derive benefit, directly or indirectly, from the handling of the Loan Account and the Collateral in a combined fashion since the successful operation of each Borrower is dependent on the continued successful performance of the integrated group.  To induce the Lender Group to do so, and in consideration thereof, each Borrower hereby jointly and severally agrees to indemnify each member of the Lender Group and hold each member of the Lender Group harmless against any and all liability, expense, loss or claim of damage or injury, made against the Lender Group by any Borrower or by any third party whosoever, arising from or incurred by reason of (i) the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral of Borrowers as herein provided, or (ii) the Lender Group's relying on any instructions of the Administrative Borrower, except that Borrowers will have no liability to the relevant Agent-Related Person or Lender-Related Person under this Section 17.13 with respect to any liability that has been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent-Related Person or Lender-Related Person, as the case may be.17.14.    No Setoff.All payments made by Borrowers hereunder or under any note or other Loan Document will be made without setoff, counterclaim, or other defense.[Signature pages to follow.]IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed and delivered as of the date first above written.PARENT:CHIQUITA BRANDS INTERNATIONAL, INC., a New Jersey corporation   By: /s/ Joseph B.

Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement.1.    In accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 13 of the Credit Agreement, the Assignor hereby sells and assigns to the Assignee, and the Assignee hereby purchases and assumes from the Assignor, that interest in and to the Assignor's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents as of the date hereof with respect to the Obligations owing to the Assignor, and Assignor's portion of the Commitments, all to the extent specified on Annex I.2.    The Assignor (a) represents and warrants that (i) it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned by it hereunder and that such interest is free and clear of any adverse claim and (ii) it has full power and authority, and has taken all action necessary, to execute and deliver this Assignment Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (b) makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to (i) any statements, representations or warranties made in or in connection with the Loan Documents, or (ii) the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of the Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (c) makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Borrower or any Guarantor or the performance or observance by any Borrower or any Guarantor of any of their respective obligations under the Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto, and (d) represents and warrants that the amount set forth as the Purchase Price on Annex I represents the amount owed by Borrowers to Assignor with respect to Assignor’s share of the Revolving Loans assigned hereunder, as reflected on Assignor’s books and records.3.    The Assignee (a) confirms that it has received copies of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with copies of the financial statements referred to therein and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Assignment Agreement; (b) agrees that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent, Assignor, or any other Lender, based upon such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking any action under the Loan Documents; (c) confirms that it is an Eligible Transferee; (d) appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are delegated to Agent by the terms thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; (e) agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of the Loan Documents are required to be performed by it as a Lender; and (f) attaches the forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States certifying as to the Assignee's status for purposes of determining exemption from United States withholding taxes with respect to all payments to be made to the Assignee under the Credit Agreement or such other documents as are necessary to indicate that all such payments are subject to such rates at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty.4.    Following the execution of this Assignment Agreement by the Assignor and Assignee, the Assignor will deliver this Assignment Agreement to the Agent for recording by the Agent.  The effective date of this Assignment (the “Settlement Date”) shall be the latest to occur of (a) the date of the execution and delivery hereof by the Assignor and the Assignee, (b) the receipt by Agent for its sole and separate account a processing fee in the amount of $3,500 (if required by the Credit Agreement), (c) the receipt of any required consents of the Agent, Administrative Borrower, Swing Lender and Issuing Bank and (d) the date specified in Annex I.5.    As of the Settlement Date (a) the Assignee shall be a party to the Credit Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned pursuant to this Assignment Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender thereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and (b) the Assignor shall, to the extent of the interest assigned pursuant to this Assignment Agreement, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under the Credit Exhibit 10.1Agreement and the other Loan Documents, provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall release any assigning Lender from obligations that survive the termination of this Agreement, including such assigning Lender’s obligations under Article 15 and Section 17.9(a) of the Credit Agreement.6.    Upon the Settlement Date, Assignee shall pay to Assignor the Purchase Price (as set forth in Annex I).  From and after the Settlement Date, Agent shall make all payments that are due and payable to the holder of the interest assigned hereunder (including payments of principal, interest, fees and other amounts) to Assignor for amounts which have accrued up to but excluding the Settlement Date and to Assignee for amounts which have accrued from and after the Settlement Date.  On the Settlement Date, Assignor shall pay to Assignee an amount equal to the portion of any interest, fee, or any other charge that was paid to Assignor prior to the Settlement Date on account of the interest assigned hereunder and that are due and payable to Assignee with respect thereto, to the extent that such interest, fee or other charge relates to the period of time from and after the Settlement Date.7.    This Assignment Agreement may be executed in counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument.  This Assignment Agreement may be executed and delivered by telecopier or other facsimile transmission all with the same force and effect as if the same were a fully executed and delivered original manual counterpart.8.    THIS ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS REGARDING CHOICE OF LAW AND VENUE, AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER SET FORTH IN SECTION 12 OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND SUCH PROVISIONS ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY THIS REFERENCE, MUTATIS MUTANDIS.Exhibit 10.1IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Assignment Agreement and Annex I hereto to be executed by their respective officers, as of the first date written above.[NAME OF ASSIGNOR] as Assignor   By   Name: Title:[NAME OF ASSIGNEE] as Assignee   By   Name: Title:ACCEPTED THIS ____ DAY OF _______________  WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a national banking association, as Agent   By   Name: Title:Exhibit 10.1ANNEX FOR ASSIGNMENT AND ACCEPTANCE  ANNEX I1.Borrowers:  CHIQUITA BRANDS L.L.C., CHIQUITA FRESH NORTH AMERICA L.L.C., FRESH INTERNATIONAL CORP., FRESH EXPRESS INCORPORATED, B C SYSTEMS, INC., VERDELLI FARMS INC., CB CONTAINERS, INC., TRANSFRESH CORPORATION and V.F.

The Specified Bank Products Provider hereby acknowledges that it has reviewed Sections 15.1 through 15.15 and Sections 15.17, 15.18, and 17.5 (collectively such sections are referred to herein as the “Agency Provisions”), including, as applicable, the defined terms used therein.  Specified Bank Products Provider and Agent each agree that the Agency Provisions which govern the relationship, and certain representations, acknowledgements, appointments, rights, restrictions, and agreements, between the Agent, on the one hand, and the Lenders or the Lender Group, on the other hand, shall, from and after the date of this letter agreement also apply to and govern, mutatis mutandis, the relationship between the Agent, on the one hand, and the Specified Bank Product Provider with respect to the Bank Products provided pursuant to the Specified Bank Product Agreement[s], on the other hand.Exhibit 10.12.    Acknowledgement of Certain Provisions of Credit Agreement.  The Specified Bank Products Provider hereby acknowledges that it has reviewed the provisions of Sections 2.4(b)(ii), 14.1, 15, and 17.5 of the Credit Agreement, including, as applicable, the defined terms used therein, and agrees to be bound by the provisions thereof.  Without limiting the generality of any of the foregoing referenced provisions, Specified Bank Product Provider understands and agrees that its rights and benefits under the Loan Documents consist solely of it being a beneficiary of the Liens and security interests granted to Agent and the right to share in proceeds of the Collateral to the extent set forth in the Credit Agreement.3.    Reporting Requirements.

If Agent chooses to implement a reserve, Specified Bank Products Provider acknowledges and agrees that Agent shall be entitled to rely on the information in the reports described above to establish the Bank Product Reserve Amount.5.    Bank Product Obligations.
