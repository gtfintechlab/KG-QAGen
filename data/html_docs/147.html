such L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer its applicable Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the

reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if any Lender does not in fact make its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then such Lender and the Borrower

voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact
and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in the participations in L/C Obligations held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to
share the excess payment in respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under
any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the
purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lenders ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lenders required repayment to (ii) the total
amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing
a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were
the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.13 and
will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands,
directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased. For the avoidance of doubt,

existence and terms of the Specified Refinancing Debt incurred pursuant thereto (including the addition of such Specified Refinancing Debt as separate Facilities and/or Tranches hereunder). Any Refinancing Amendment may, without the
consent of any Person other than the Borrower, the Specified Refinancing Agent and the Lenders providing such Specified Refinancing Debt, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in
the reasonable opinion of the Specified Refinancing Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of or consistent with this Section 2.18. In addition, if so provided in the relevant Refinancing Amendment and with the consent of each L/C
Issuer, participations in Letters of Credit expiring on or after the scheduled Maturity Date in respect of a Revolving Tranche shall be reallocated from Lenders holding Revolving Credit Commitments to Lenders holding extended revolving commitments
in accordance with the terms of such Refinancing Amendment; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that such participation interests shall, upon receipt thereof by the relevant Lenders holding extended revolving commitments, be deemed to be participation
interests in respect of such extended revolving commitments and the terms of such participation interests (including the commission applicable thereto) shall be adjusted accordingly. If the Specified Refinancing Agent is not the Administrative
Agent, the actions authorized to be taken by the Specified Refinancing Agent herein shall be done in consultation with the Administrative Agent and, with respect to the preparation of any documentation necessary or appropriate to carry out the
provisions of this Section 2.18 (including amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents), any comments to such documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent shall be reflected therein. </p>

of this Certificate, the terms below shall have the following definitions: </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a) Fair Value </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The amount at which the assets (both tangible and intangible), in their entirety, of the Borrower and its subsidiaries taken as a whole would
change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, within a commercially reasonable period of time, each having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts, with neither being under any compulsion to act. </p>

reasonably evaluated. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) Liabilities </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The recorded liabilities (including contingent liabilities that would be recorded in accordance with GAAP) of the Borrower and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, as of the date hereof after giving effect to the Transactions (as defined below), determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. </p>

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the period from the date hereof through the Maturity Date, the Borrower and its subsidiaries taken as a whole will have sufficient assets
and cash flow to pay their Liabilities as those liabilities mature or (in the case of contingent Liabilities) otherwise become payable, in light of business conducted or anticipated to be conducted by the Borrower and its subsidiaries as reflected
in the projected financial statements and in light of the anticipated credit capacity. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(e) Do not have Unreasonably Small
Capital </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Borrower and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole after consummation of the Transaction, is a going concern and has
sufficient capital to reasonably ensure that it will continue to be a going concern for the period from the date hereof through the Maturity Date. I understand that unreasonably small capital depends upon the nature of the particular
business or businesses conducted or to be conducted, and I have reached my conclusion based on the needs and anticipated needs for capital of the business conducted or anticipated to be conducted by the Borrower and its subsidiaries as reflected in
the projected financial statements and in light of the anticipated credit capacity. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">3. For purposes of this Certificate, I, or officers of
the Borrower under my direction and supervision, have performed the following procedures as of and for the periods set forth below: </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a) I
have reviewed the financial statements referred to in Section 5.05 of the Credit Agreement. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) I have knowledge of and have reviewed
to my satisfaction the Credit Agreement. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">4. As Chief Financial Officer of the Borrower, I am familiar with the financial condition of the
