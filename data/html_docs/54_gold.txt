If such notice is given, the Components of the Loan shall be converted, as of the first day of the next succeeding Interest Period, to a LIBOR Loan. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Borrower have the right to convert a Prime Rate Loan to a LIBOR Loan.(d) If, pursuant to the terms hereof, the Components of the Loan have been converted to a Prime Rate Loan and thereafter Lender shall have reasonably determined that an Alternative Base Rate then exists, Lender shall give notice by telephone of such determination, confirmed in writing, to Borrower at least one (1) Business Day prior to the next succeeding Interest Determination Date. If such notice is given, the Components of the Loan shall be converted, as of the first day of the next succeeding Interest Period, to an Alternative Base Rate Loan bearing interest based on the Alternative Base Rate in effect on the related Determination Date. Notwithstanding any provision  of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Borrower have the right to convert a Prime Rate Loan to an Alternative Base Rate Loan.(e) If the adoption of any requirement of law or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall hereafter make it unlawful for Lender to maintain a LIBOR Loan as contemplated hereunder, (i) the obligation of Lender hereunder to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan or to convert a Prime Rate Loan to a LIBOR Loan shall be canceled forthwith and (ii) any outstanding LIBOR Loan shall be converted automatically to an Alternative Base Rate Loan if an Alternative Base Rate then exists, as reasonably determined by Servicer, or otherwise to a Prime Rate Loan on the first day of the next succeeding Interest Period, or upon such earlier date as may be required by law.

This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are subject to the express condition that at no time shall Borrower be required to pay interest on the Outstanding Principal Balance at a rate which could subject Lender to either civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate.  If by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the Outstanding Principal Balance at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Interest Rate shall be deemed to be immediately reduced to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and not on account of the interest due hereunder.

Borrower shall take all actions reasonably requested by Lender to enforce Borrower’s rights under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement in the event of a default by the Counterparty thereunder and shall not waive, amend or otherwise modify any of its rights thereunder.(b)    Borrower shall defend Lender’s right, title and interest in and to the Rate Cap Collateral pledged by Borrower pursuant hereto or in which it has granted a security interest pursuant hereto against the claims and demands of all other Persons. (c)    In the event of any downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the rating of the Counterparty such that it ceases to qualify as an “Approved Counterparty” Borrower shall replace the Interest Rate Cap Agreement with a Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement not later than ten (10) Business Days following receipt of notice from Lender, Servicer or any other Person of such downgrade, withdrawal or qualification.(d)    In the event that Borrower fails to purchase and deliver to Lender the Interest Rate Cap Agreement as and when required hereunder, Lender may purchase the Interest Rate Cap Agreement and the cost incurred by Lender in purchasing the Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall be paid by Borrower to Lender with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date such cost was incurred by Lender until such cost is paid by Borrower to Lender.(e)    Borrower shall not sell, assign, or otherwise dispose of, or mortgage, pledge or grant a security interest in, any of the Rate Cap Collateral or any interest therein, and any sale, assignment, mortgage, pledge or security interest whatsoever made in violation of this covenant shall be a nullity and of no force and effect, and upon demand of Lender, shall forthwith be cancelled or satisfied by an appropriate instrument in writing.(f)    Borrower shall not (i) without the prior written consent of Lender, modify, amend or supplement the terms of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, (ii) without the prior written consent of Lender, except in accordance with the terms of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, cause the termination of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement prior to its stated maturity date, (iii)  without the prior written consent of Lender, except as aforesaid, waive or release any obligation of the Counterparty (or any successor or substitute party to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement) under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, (iv) without the prior written consent of Lender, consent or agree to any act or omission to act on the part of the Counterparty (or any successor or substitute party to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement) which, without such consent or agreement, would constitute a default under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, (v) fail to exercise promptly and diligently each and every material right which it may have under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, (vi) take or intentionally omit to take any action or intentionally suffer or permit any action to be omitted or taken, the taking or omission of which would result in any right of offset against sums payable under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement or any defense by the Counterparty (or any successor or substitute party to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement) to payment or (vii) fail to give prompt notice to Lender of any notice of default given by or to Borrower under or with respect to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, together with a complete copy of such notice.  If Borrower shall have received written notice that the Securitization shall have occurred, no consent by Lender provided for in this Section 2.6.3 (f) shall be given by Lender unless Lender shall have received a Rating Agency Confirmation.(g)    In connection with an Interest Rate Cap Agreement, Borrower shall obtain and deliver to Lender an opinion of counsel from counsel (which counsel may be in-house counsel for the Counterparty) for the Counterparty upon which Lender and its successors and assigns may rely (the “Counterparty Opinion”), under New York law and, if the Counterparty is a non-U.S. entity, the applicable foreign law, which shall provide in relevant part, that: (i) the issuer is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has the organizational power and authority to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, the Interest Rate Cap Agreement; (ii) the execution and delivery of the Interest Rate Cap  Agreement by the issuer, and any other agreement which the issuer has executed and delivered pursuant thereto, and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been and remain duly authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of its certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or equivalent organizational documents) or any law, regulation or contractual restriction binding on or affecting it or its property; (iii) all consents, author

ch the issuer has executed and delivered pursuant thereto, and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been obtained and remain in full force and effect, all conditions thereof have been duly complied with, and no other action by, and no notice to or filing with any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for such execution, delivery or performance; and (iv) the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, and any other agreement which the issuer has executed and delivered pursuant thereto, has been duly executed and delivered by the issuer and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the issuer, enforceable against the issuer in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).2.6.4    [Reserved].2.6.5    Representations and Warranties.  Borrower hereby covenants with, and represents and warrants to Lender as of the Closing Date as follows:(a)    The Interest Rate Cap Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Borrower, enforceable against Borrower in accordance with its terms, subject only to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting rights of creditors generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).(b)    The Rate Cap Collateral is free and clear of all claims or security interests of every nature whatsoever, except such as are created pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and Borrower has the right to pledge and grant a security interest in the same as herein provided without the consent of any other Person other than any such consent that has been obtained and is in full force and effect.(c)    The Rate Cap Collateral has been duly and validly pledged hereunder.  All consents and approvals required to be obtained by Borrower for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been obtained.(d)    Giving effect to the aforesaid grant and assignment to Lender, Lender has, as of the date of this Agreement, and as to Rate Cap Collateral acquired from time to time after such date, shall have, a valid, and upon proper filing, perfected and continuing first priority lien upon and security interest in the Rate Cap Collateral; provided that no representation or warranty is made with respect to the perfected status of the security interest of Lender in the proceeds of Rate Cap Collateral consisting of “cash proceeds” or “non-cash proceeds” as defined in the UCC except if, and to the extent, the provisions of Section 9-306 of the UCC shall be complied with.(e)    Except for financing statements filed or to be filed in favor of Lender as secured party, there are no financing statements under the UCC covering any or all of the Rate Cap  Collateral and Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender, until payment in full of all of the Obligations, execute and file in any public office, any enforceable financing statement or statements covering any or all of the Rate Cap Collateral, except financing statements filed or to be filed in favor of Lender as secured party.2.6.6    Payments.  If Borrower at any time shall be entitled to receive any payments with respect to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, Borrower shall direct Counterparty to deposit such amounts, immediately upon becoming payable to Borrower into the Collection Account; provided that if, notwithstanding such direction, Borrower receives any payments with respect to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, Borrower shall immediately deposit such amounts into the Collection Account.2.6.7    Remedies. Subject to the provisions of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, if an Event of Default shall occur and then be continuing:(a)    Lender, without obligation to resort to any other security, right or remedy granted under any other agreement or instrument, shall have the right to, in addition to all rights, powers and remedies of a secured party pursuant to the UCC, at any time and from time to time, sell, resell, assign and deliver, in its sole discretion, any or all of the Rate Cap Collateral (in one or more parcels and at the same or different times) and all right, title and interest, claim and demand therein and right of redemption thereof, at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery, and in connection therewith Lender may grant options and may impose reasonable conditions such as requiring any purchaser to represent that any “securities” constituting any part of the Rate Cap Collateral are being purchased for investment only, Borrower hereby waiving and releasing any and all equity or right of redemption to the fullest extent permitted by the UCC or applicable law.  If all or any of the Rate Cap Collateral is sold by Lender upon credit or for future delivery, Lender shall not be liable for the failure of the purchaser to purchase or pay for the same and, in the event of any such failure, Lender may resell such Rate Cap Collateral.  It is expressly agreed that Lender may exercise its rights with respect to less than all of the Rate Cap Collateral, leaving unexercised its rights with respect to the remainder of the Rate Cap Collateral, provided, however, that such partial exercise shall in no way restrict or jeopardize Lender’s right to exercise its rights with respect to all or any other portion of the Rate Cap Collateral at a later time or times.(b)    Lender may exercise, either by itself or by its nominee or designee, in the name of Borrower, all of Lender’s rights, powers and remedies in respect of the Rate Cap Collateral, hereunder and under law.(c)    Borrower hereby irrevocably, in the name of Borrower or otherwise, authorizes and empowers Lender and assigns and transfers unto Lender, and constitutes and appoints Lender its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, and as its agent, irrevocably, with full power of substitution for Borrower and in the name of Borrower, (i) to exercise and enforce every right, power, remedy, authority, option and privilege of Borrower under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, including any power to subordinate or modify the Interest Rate Cap Agreement (but not, unless an Event of Default exists and is continuing, the right to terminate or cancel the Interest Rate Cap Agreement), or to give any notices, or to take any action resulting in such subordination, termination, cancellation or modification and (ii) in order to more fully vest in Lender the rights and remedies provided for herein, to exercise all of the rights, remedies and powers granted to Lender in this  Agreement, and Borrower further authorizes and empowers Lender, as Borrower’s attorney-in-fact, and as its agent, irrevocably, with full power of substitution for Borrower and in the name of Borrower, to give any authorization, to furnish any information, to make any demands, to execute any instruments and to take any and all other action on behalf of and in the name of Borrower which in the opinion of Lender may be necessary or appropriate to be given, furnished, made, exercised or taken under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, in order to comply therewith, to perform the conditions thereof or to prevent or remedy any default by Borrower thereunder or to enforce any of the rights of Borrower thereunder.  These powers-of-attorney are irrevocable and coupled with an interest, and any similar or dissimilar powers heretofore given by Borrower in respect of the Rate Cap Collateral to any other Person are hereby revoked.(d)    Lender may, without notice to, or assent by, Borrower or any other Person (to the extent permitted by law), but without affecting any of the Obligations, in the name of Borrower or in the name of Lender, notify the Counterparty, or if applicable, any other counterparty to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, to make payment and performance directly to Lender; extend the time of payment and performance of, compromise or settle for cash, credit or otherwise, and upon any terms and conditions, any obligations owing to Borrower, or claims of Borrower, under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement; file any claims, commence, maintain or discontinue any actions, suits or other proceedings deemed by Lender necessary or advisable for the purpose of collecting upon or enforcing the Interest Rate Cap Agreement; and execute any instrument and do all other things deemed necessary and proper by Lender to protect and preserve and realize upon the Rate Cap Collateral and the other rights contemplated hereby.(e)    Pursuant to the powers-of-attorney provided for above, Lender may take any action and exercise and execute any instrument which it may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof; provided, however, that Lender shall not be permitted to take any action pursuant to said power-of-attorney that would conflict with any limitation on Lender’s rights with respect to the Rate Cap Collateral.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Lender, after the occurrence of an Event of Default, shall have the right and power to receive, endorse and collect all checks and other orders for the payment of money made payable to Borrower representing:  (i) any payment of obligations owed pursuant to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, (ii) interest accruing on any of the Rate Cap Collateral or (iii) any other payment or distribution payable in respect of the Rate Cap Collateral or any part thereof, and for and in the name, place and stead of Borrower, to execute endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer in respect of any property which is or may become a part of the Rate Cap Collateral hereunder.(f)    Lender may exercise all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC.(g)    Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement or any of Borrower’s rights hereunder, and without waiving or releasing Borrower from any obligation or default hereunder, Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, to perform any act or take any appropriate action, as it, in its reasonable judgment, may deem necessary to protect the security of this Agreement, to cure such Event of Default or to cause any term, covenant, condition or obligation required under this Agreement or the Interest Rate Cap Agreement to be performed or observed by Borrower to be promptly performed or observed on behalf of Borrower.  All amounts advanced by, or on behalf of, Lender in exercising its rights under this Section 2.6.7(g) (including, but not limited  to, reasonable legal expenses and disbursements incurred in connection therewith), together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date of each such advance, shall be payable by Borrower to Lender upon demand and shall be secured by this Agreement.2.6.8    Sales of Rate Cap Collateral.  No demand, advertisement or notice, all of which are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, hereby expressly waived by Borrower, shall be required in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or any part of the Rate Cap Collateral, except that Lender shall give Borrower at least thirty (30) Business Days’ prior written notice of the time and place of any public sale or of the time when and the place where any private sale or other disposition is to be made, which notice Borrower hereby agrees is reasonable, all other demands, advertisements and notices being hereby waived.  To the extent permitted by law, Lender shall not be obligated to make any sale of the Rate Cap Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale may have been given, and Lender may without notice or publication adjourn any public or private sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned.  Upon each private sale of the Rate Cap Collateral of a type customarily sold in a recognized market and upon each public sale, unless prohibited by any applicable statute which cannot be waived, Lender (or its nominee or designee) may purchase any or all of the Rate Cap Collateral being sold, free and discharged from any trusts, claims, equity or right of redemption of Borrower, all of which are hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law, and may make payment therefor by credit against any of the Obligations in lieu of cash or any other obligations.  In the case of all sales of the Rate Cap Collateral, public or private, Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind for sale or delivery, including brokers’ and attorneys’ fees and disbursements and any tax imposed thereon.  However, the proceeds of sale of Rate Cap Collateral shall be available to cover such costs and expenses, and, after deducting such costs and expenses from the proceeds of sale, Lender shall apply any residue to the payment of the Obligations in the order of priority as set forth in this Agreement.2.6.9    Public Sales Not Possible. Borrower acknowledges that the terms of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement may prohibit public sales, that the Rate Cap Collateral may not be of the type appropriately sold at public sales, and that such sales may be prohibited by law.  In light of these considerations, Borrower agrees that private sales of the Rate Cap Collateral shall not be deemed to have been made in a commercially unreasonably manner by mere virtue of having been made privately.2.6.10    Receipt of Sale Proceeds.  Upon any sale of the Rate Cap Collateral by Lender hereunder (whether by virtue of the power of sale herein granted, pursuant to judicial process or otherwise), the receipt by Lender or the officer making the sale or the proceeds of such sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Rate Cap Collateral so sold, and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to Lender or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication or non-application thereof.2.6.11    Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement.  If, in connection with Borrower’s exercise of any Extension Option pursuant to Section 2.7, Borrower delivers a Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement, all the provisions of this Section 2.6 applicable to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement delivered on the Closing Date shall be applicable to the Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement. Section 2.7    Extension Options. 2.7.1    Extension Options.  Borrower shall have the option to extend the term of the Loan for five (5) successive terms of one year beyond the Stated Maturity Date (each successive term, an “Extension Term”). Borrower shall have the option (the “First Extension Option”), by written notice (the “First Extension Notice”) delivered to Lender (which notice may be revoked) no later than thirty (30) days prior to the Stated Maturity Date, to extend the Maturity Date to March 9, 2021 (the “First Extended Maturity Date”).

In the event Borrower shall have exercised the Third Extension Option, Borrower shall have the option (the “Fourth Extension Option”), by written notice (the “Fourth Extension Notice”) delivered to Lender (which notice may be revoked) no later than thirty (30) days prior to the Third Extended Maturity Date, to extend the Third Extended Maturity Date to March 9, 2024 (the “Fourth Extended Maturity Date”).  In the event Borrower shall have exercised the Fourth Extension Option, Borrower shall have the option (the “Fifth Extension Option”), by written notice (the “Fifth Extension Notice”) delivered to Lender (which notice may be revoked) no later than thirty (30) days prior to the Fourth Extended Maturity Date, to extend the Fourth Extended Maturity Date to March 9, 2025 (the “Fifth Extended Maturity Date”).

As soon as practicable following an extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 2.7, Borrower shall, if requested by Lender, execute and deliver an amendment of and/or restatement of the Note and shall, if requested by Lender, enter into such amendments to the related Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate to evidence the extension of the Maturity Date as provided in this Section 2.7; provided, however, that no failure by Borrower to enter into any such amendments and/or restatements shall affect the rights or obligations of Borrower or Lender with respect to the extension of the Maturity Date.Section 2.8    Spread Maintenance Premium. Upon any repayment or prepayment of the Loan (including in connection with an acceleration of the Loan but excluding in connection with any mandatory prepayment pursuant to Section 2.4.3(a) (except where such prepayment arises as a result of a Voluntary Action) or Section 2.4.3(c)) made prior to the Spread Maintenance Date, Borrower shall pay to Lender on the date of such repayment or prepayment (or acceleration of the Loan) the Spread Maintenance Premium applicable thereto.  All Spread Maintenance Premium payments hereunder shall be deemed to be earned by Lender upon the funding of the Loan.Section 2.9    Increased Costs.  If as a result of any Regulatory Change or compliance of Lender therewith, the basis of taxation of payments to Lender or any company in Control of Lender of the principal of or interest on the Loan is changed or Lender or the company in Control of Lender shall be subject to (i) any reserve, special deposit or similar requirements relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities, of Lender or any company in Control of Lender is imposed, modified or deemed applicable; or (ii) any other condition (other than Taxes) affecting loans to borrowers subject to LIBOR-based interest rates is imposed on Lender or any company in Control of Lender and Lender determines that, by reason thereof, the cost to Lender or any company in Control of Lender of making, maintaining or extending the Loan to Borrower is increased, or any amount receivable by Lender or any company in Control of Lender hereunder in respect of any portion of the Loan to Borrower is reduced, in each case by an amount deemed by Lender in good faith to be material (such increases in cost and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called “Increased Costs”), then Lender shall provide notice thereof to Borrower and Borrower agrees that it will pay to Lender upon Lender’s written request such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Lender or any company in Control of Lender for such Increased Costs to the extent Lender determines that such Increased Costs are allocable to the Loan.  If Lender requests compensation under this Section 2.9, Lender shall, if  requested by notice by Borrower to Lender, furnish to Borrower a statement setting forth the basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining the amount thereof.Section 2.10    Taxes. 2.10.1    Defined Terms.  For purposes of this Section 2.10, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.2.10.2    Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of Borrower) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by Borrower, then Borrower shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.10) Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.2.10.3    Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower.  Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law any Other Taxes.2.10.4    Indemnification by the Loan Parties.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.2.10.5    Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.10, Borrower shall deliver to Lender the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Lender.2.10.6    Status of Lender.  (a)    If Lender is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document then Lender shall deliver to Borrower, at the time or times reasonably requested by Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, Lender, if reasonably requested by Borrower, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by Borrower as will enable Borrower to determine whether or not Lender is subject to  backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.10.6(b)(i), (b)(ii) and (b)(iv) below) shall not be required if in Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of Lender.(b)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i)    If Lender is a U.S. Person it shall deliver to Borrower (in such number of copies as shall be reasonably requested by Borrower) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;

or(D)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN (in the case of an individual) or W-8BEN-E (in the case of an entity), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit  F-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;(iii)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower (in such number of copies as shall be reasonably requested by Borrower) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and(iv)    if a payment made to Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), Lender shall deliver to Borrower at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower as may be necessary for Borrower to comply with its obligations under FATCA and to determine that Lender has complied with Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (iv), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower in writing of its legal inability to do so.2.10.7    Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.10 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.10), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 2.10.7 (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in t

party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.10.7, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.10.7 the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have  been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This Section 2.10.7 shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.2.10.8    Survival.  Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.10 shall survive any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, Lender and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.Section 2.11    Substitutions. Borrower may substitute any Property or a portfolio of Properties with a Substitute Property or a portfolio of Substitute Properties and Lender shall release the Replaced Property or portfolio of Replaced Properties from the applicable Mortgage Documents and release the security interest and Lien on any Collateral located at such Property;

If Borrower or any party other than Lender receives any Condemnation Proceeds, Borrower shall immediately deliver such proceeds to Lender and shall endorse, and cause all such third parties to endorse, a check payable therefore to the order of Lender.  Lender shall not be limited to the interest paid on the Award by the condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive out of the Award interest at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Note.  Net Proceeds from a Condemnation shall be applied as follows:(a)    If a partial Condemnation of a Property does not interfere with the use of such Property as a residential rental property, then the Net Proceeds paid by the condemning authority shall be applied to the prepayment of the Debt in accordance with Section 2.4.3(c).  (b)    If a partial Condemnation of a Property does interfere with the use of such Property as a residential rental property or if there occurs a complete Condemnation of a Property (each, a “Fully Condemned Property”), then (i) if no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and, within thirty (30) days of the date of the occurrence of such Condemnation, Borrower delivers to Lender a written undertaking to substitute the Fully Condemned Property with a Substitute Property in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.4.3(a), then (A) if Net Proceeds are paid by the condemning authority directly to Borrower subsequent to such Substitution, such Net Proceeds may be retained by Borrower (for the avoidance of doubt, Net Proceeds received by Borrower prior to such Substitution shall be immediately paid to Lender as required by Section 5.2), (B) if Net Proceeds are paid by the condemning authority to Lender, such Net Proceeds will be disbursed by Lender to Borrower upon the consummation of such Substitution and (C) Borrower shall provide a Substitute Property within ten (10) Business Days of the date of such undertaking in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.4.3(a) and (ii) if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or Borrower fails to deliver such an undertaking to Lender, then (A) Lender may retain any Net Proceeds received by it, (B) Borrower shall immediately deliver to Lender any Net Proceeds paid to Borrower, (C) Net Proceeds shall be applied to the prepayment of the Debt in accordance with Section 2.4.3(c) and (D) Borrower shall prepay the Loan in an  amount equal to the positive difference between such Net Proceeds and the Allocated Loan Amount for the Fully Condemned Property, together with all interest and other amounts required to be paid in connection therewith under Section 2.4.5 (collectively, the “Fully Condemned Property Prepayment Amounts”).  Following Borrower’s written request after either (1) the Substitution of a Substitute Property for such Fully Condemned Property in accordance with the conditions set forth above or (2) receipt by Lender of the Net Proceeds and payment by Borrower of the Fully Condemned Property Prepayment Amounts, Lender shall release the Fully Condemned Property from the applicable Mortgage Documents and related Lien, provided, that (x) Borrower has delivered to Lender a draft release (and, in the event the Mortgage and the Assignment of Leases and Rents applicable to the Fully Condemned Property encumbers other Property(ies) in addition to the Fully Condemned Property, such release shall be a partial release that relates only to the Fully Condemned Property and does not affect the Liens and security interests encumbering or on the other Property(ies)) in form and substance appropriate for the jurisdiction in which such Fully Condemned Property is located and shall contain standard provisions protecting the rights of Lender and (y) Borrower shall pay all costs, taxes and expenses associated with such release (including, without limitation, cost to file and record the release and Lender’s reasonable attorneys’ fees).Section 5.4    Restoration.

If required by Lender, the release of any such portion of the Casualty Retainage shall be approved by the surety company, if any, which has issued a payment or performance bond with respect to the contractor, subcontractor or materialman.(v)    Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements of the Net Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.(vi)    If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed balance thereof shall not, in the opinion of Lender in consultation with the Casualty Consultant, be sufficient to pay in full the balance of the costs which are estimated by the Casualty Consultant to be incurred in connection with the completion of the Restoration, Borrower shall deposit the deficiency (the “Net Proceeds Deficiency”) with Lender (for deposit into the Casualty and Condemnation Account) before any further disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall be made.  The Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender shall be deposited by Lender into the Casualty and Condemnation Account and shall be disbursed for costs actually incurred in connection with the Restoration on the same conditions applicable to the disbursement of the Net Proceeds, and until so disbursed pursuant to this Section 5.4(d) shall constitute additional security for the Obligations. (vii)    The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the remaining balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender after the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.4(d), and the receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory to Lender that all costs incurred in connection with the Restoration have been paid in full, shall be remitted by Lender to Borrower, provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be continuing.(e)    All reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with any Restoration including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, shall be paid by Borrower.(f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, including the provisions of Section 5.3 or Section 5.4, if the Loan is included in a REMIC Trust and, immediately following a release of any portion of the Lien of a Mortgage following a Casualty or Condemnation of a Property (but taking into account any proposed Restoration of the remaining portion of such Property), the ratio of the unpaid principal balance of the Loan to the value of the remaining Properties is greater than one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) (such value to be determined, in Lender’s sole discretion, by any commercially reasonable method permitted to a REMIC Trust; and which shall exclude the value of personal property (other than fixtures) or going concern value, if any), the Outstanding Principal Balance must be paid down (by application of the Net Proceeds or Award, as applicable, or if such amounts are not sufficient, by Borrower) by a “qualified amount” as that term is defined in the IRS Revenue Procedure 2010-30, as the same may be amended, replaced, supplemented or modified from time to time, unless Lender receives an opinion of counsel that if such amount is not paid, the applicable Securitization will not fail to maintain its status as a REMIC Trust as a result of the related release of such portion of the Lien of such Mortgage.  If and to the extent the preceding sentence applies, only such amount of the net Award or net Insurance Proceeds (as applicable), if any, in excess of the amount required to pay down the principal balance of the Loan may be released for purposes of Restoration or released to Borrower as otherwise expressly provided in Section 5.3 or Section 5.4.(g)    In the event of foreclosure of a Mortgage, or other transfer of title to a Property or Properties in extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to the Policies that are not blanket Policies then in force concerning such Property or Properties and all proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest in the purchaser at such foreclosure or Lender or other transferee in the event of such other transfer of title.Article 6      CASH MANAGEMENT AND RESERVE FUNDSSection 6.1    Cash Management Arrangements.  6.1.1    Rent Deposit Account and Collection Account.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if an Event of Default is continuing (i) Lender shall not be subject to any “one action” or “election of remedies” law or rule, and (ii) all Liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided to Lender shall remain in full force and effect until Lender has exhausted all of its remedies against the Properties and the other Collateral and each Mortgage has been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized upon in satisfaction of the Obligations or the Obligations have been paid in full including, without limitation, any liquidation fees, workout fees, special servicing fees and interest payable on advances made by the Servicer  with respect to delinquent debt service payments or expenses of curing Borrower’s or any Loan Party’s defaults under the Loan Documents or other similar fees payable to Servicer or any special servicer in connection therewith.  No delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient.  A waiver of one Default or Event of Default with respect to a Relevant Party shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by such Relevant Party or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.(b)    With respect to Borrower, the other Loan Parties and the Collateral, nothing contained herein or in any other Loan Document shall be construed as requiring Lender to resort to any Property or other portion of the Collateral for the satisfaction of any of the Debt in preference or priority to any other portion of the Collateral, and Lender may seek satisfaction out of all of the Collateral or any part thereof, in its absolute discretion in respect of the Debt.  During the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender shall have the right from time to time to partially foreclose any Mortgage or the Lien of any of the other Collateral Documents in any manner and for any amounts secured by the Collateral Documents then due and payable as determined by Lender in its sole discretion, including the following circumstances:  (i) in the event Borrower defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of one or more scheduled payments of principal and interest, Lender may foreclose one or more of the Mortgages or other Collateral Documents to recover such delinquent payments, or (ii) in the event Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire Outstanding Principal Balance, Lender may foreclose one or more of the Mortgages or other Collateral Documents to recover so much of the principal balance of the Loan as Lender may accelerate and such other sums secured by the Mortgages and the other Collateral Documents as Lender may elect.  Notwithstanding one or more partial foreclosures, the Collateral shall remain subject to the Mortgages and the other Collateral Documents to secure payment of the sums secured by the Collateral Documents and not previously recovered.8.2.3    Severance.  (a)    During the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender shall have the right from time to time to sever the Note and the other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes, Collateral Documents and other security documents in such denominations as Lender shall determine in its sole discretion for purposes of evidencing and enforcing its rights and remedies provided hereunder.  The Loan Parties shall execute and deliver to Lender from time to time, promptly after the request of Lender, a severance agreement and such other documents as Lender shall request in order to effect the severance described in the preceding sentence, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender.  The Loan Parties hereby absolutely and irrevocably appoint Lender as its true and lawful attorney, coupled with an interest, in its name and stead to make and execute all documents necessary or desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower ratifying all that its said attorney shall do by virtue thereof; provided, however, Lender shall not make or execute any such documents under such power until three (3) days after notice has been given to a Loan Party by Lender of Lender’s intent to exercise its rights under such power.(b)    During the continuance of an Event of Default, any amounts recovered from the Collateral may be applied by Lender toward the payment of any interest and/or principal of the  Loan and/or any other amounts due under the Loan Documents, in such order, priority and proportions as Lender in its sole discretion shall determine.(c)    As used in this Section 8.2, a “foreclosure” shall include, without limitation, any sale by power of sale.8.2.4    Lender’s Right to Perform.  If any Loan Party fails to perform any covenant or obligation contained herein and such failure shall continue for a period of five (5) Business Days after Borrower’s receipt of written notice thereof from Lender, without in any way limiting Lender’s right to exercise any of its rights, powers or remedies as provided hereunder, or under any of the other Loan Documents, Lender may, but shall have no obligation to, perform, or cause the performance of, such covenant or obligation, and all costs, expenses, liabilities, penalties and fines of Lender incurred or paid in connection therewith shall be payable by Borrower to Lender upon demand and if not paid shall be added to the Obligations (and to the extent permitted under applicable laws, secured by the Mortgages and the other Collateral Documents) and shall bear interest thereafter at the Default Rate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lender shall have no obligation to send notice to Borrower of any such failure.Article 9      SECURITIZATIONSection 9.1    Securitization.(a)    Lender shall have the right (i) to sell or otherwise transfer the Loan or any portion thereof as a whole loan, (ii) to sell participation interests in the Loan, or (iii) to securitize the Loan or any portion thereof in a single asset securitization or a pooled loan securitization.  (The transactions referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) are each hereinafter referred to as a “Secondary Market Transaction” and the transactions referred to in clause (iii) shall hereinafter be referred to as a “Securitization”.

and(iv)    execute amendments to the Loan Documents and the Loan Parties’ organizational documents requested by Lender; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be required to modify or amend any Loan Document if such modification or amendment would (A) cause the initial weighted average of the interest rates for all Components in the aggregate immediately after the effective date of such modification to exceed the weighted average interest rate of the original Components in the aggregate immediately prior to such modification, (B) cause the outstanding principal balance of all Components in the aggregate immediately after the effective date of such modification to exceed the outstanding principal balance of all Components in the aggregate immediately prior to such modification, (C) require Borrower to make or remake any representations or warranties, (D) require principal amortization of the Loan (other than repayment in full on the Maturity Date), (E) change any Stated Maturity Date or (F) otherwise increase the obligations or reduce the rights of Borrower or any Guarantor under the Loan Documents.(c)    If, at the time a Disclosure Document is being prepared for a Securitization, Lender reasonably determines that Borrower alone or Borrower and one or more Affiliates of Borrower (including any guarantor or other Person that is directly or indirectly committed by contract or otherwise to make payments on all or a part of the Loan) collectively, or the Properties alone or the Properties and Related Properties collectively, will be a Significant Obligor, Borrower shall furnish to Lender upon request the following financial information:(i)    if Lender reasonably determines that the principal amount of the Loan together with any Related Loans, as of the cut-off date for such Securitization, may equal or exceed ten percent (10%) (but less than twenty percent (20%)) of the aggregate principal amount of all mortgage loans included or expected to be included in the Securitization, net operating income for the Properties and the Related Properties for the most recent Fiscal Year and interim period as required under Item 1112(b)(1) of Regulation AB (or, if the Loan is not treated as a non-recourse loan under Instruction 3 for Item 1101(k) of Regulation AB,  selected financial data meeting the requirements and covering the time periods specified in Item 301 of Regulation S-K and Item 1112(b)(1) of Regulation AB), or(ii)    if Lender reasonably determines that the principal amount of the Loan together with any Related Loans, as of the cut-off date for such Securitization, may equal or exceed twenty percent (20%) of the aggregate principal amount of all mortgage loans included or expected to be included in the Securitization, the financial statements required under Item 1112(b)(2) of Regulation AB (which includes, but may not be limited to, a balance sheet with respect to the entity that Lender determines to be a Significant Obligor for the two most recent Fiscal Years and applicable interim periods, meeting the requirements of Rule 3-01 of Regulation S-X, and statements of income and statements of cash flows with respect to the Properties for the three most recent Fiscal Years and applicable interim periods, meeting the requirements of Rule 3-02 of Regulation S-X (or if Lender determines that the Properties is the Significant Obligor and the Properties (other than properties that are hotels, nursing homes, or other properties that would be deemed to constitute a business and not real estate under Regulation S-X or other legal requirements) was acquired from an unaffiliated third party and the other conditions set forth in Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X have been met, the financial statements required by Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X)).(d)    Further, if requested by Lender, Borrower shall, promptly upon Lender’s request, furnish to Lender financial data or financial statements meeting the requirements of Item 1112(b)(1) or (2) of Regulation AB, as specified by Lender, for any Tenant of the Properties if, in connection with a Securitization, Lender reasonably determines there to be, as of the cutoff date for such Securitization, a concentration with respect to such Tenant or group of Affiliated Tenants within all of the mortgage loans included or expected to be included in the Securitization such that such Tenant or group of Affiliated Tenants would constitute a Significant Obligor. Borrower shall furnish to Lender, in connection with the preparation of the Disclosure Documents and on an ongoing basis, financial data and/or financial statements with respect to such Tenants meeting the requirements of Item 1112(b)(1) or (2) of Regulation AB, as specified by Lender, but only for so long as such entity or entities are a Significant Obligor and either (x) filings pursuant to the Exchange Act in connection with or relating to the Securitization (an “Exchange Act Filing”) are required to be made under applicable Legal Requirements or (y) comparable information is required to otherwise be “available” to holders of the Securities under Regulation AB or applicable Legal Requirements.(e)    If Lender determines that Borrower alone or Borrower and one or more Affiliates of Borrower collectively, or the Properties alone or the Properties and Related Properties collectively, are a Significant Obligor, then Borrower shall furnish to Lender, on an ongoing basis, selected financial data or financial statements meeting the requirements of Item 1112(b)(1) or (2) of Regulation AB, as specified by Lender, but only for so long as such entity or entities are a Significant Obligor and either (x) Exchange Act Filings are required to be made under applicable Legal Requirements or (y) comparable information is required to otherwise be “available” to holders of the Securities under Regulation AB or applicable Legal Requirements.(f)    If reasonably requested by Lender, Borrower shall provide Lender, within a reasonable period of time following Lender’s request therefor, with any other or additional financial statements, or financial, statistical or operating information, as Lender shall reasonably determine to be required pursuant to Regulation S-K or Regulation S-X, as applicable, Regulation AB, or any  amendment, modification or replacement thereto or other Legal Requirements relating to a Securitization or as shall otherwise be reasonably requested by Lender.Section 9.2    Securitization Indemnification. (a)    Borrower understands that information provided to Lender by Borrower, the Guarantors and their respective agents, counsel and representatives may be included in preliminary and final disclosure documents in connection with any Secondary Market Transaction, including a Securitization, including an offering circular, a prospectus, prospectus supplement, private placement memorandum or other offering document (each, a “Disclosure Document”) and may also be included in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and may be made available to investors or prospective investors in the Securities, investment banking firms, NRSROs, accounting firms, law firms and other third-party advisory and service providers relating to any Secondary Market Transaction, including a Securitization.

In the event that any action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled, jointly with any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and, to the extent that it (or t

Prior to a Securitization, whenever pursuant to this Agreement the Rating Agencies are given any right to approve or disapprove any matter, or any arrangement or term is to be satisfactory to the Rating Agencies, the decision of Lender to approve or disapprove such matter or to decide whether arrangements or terms are satisfactory or not satisfactory, based upon Lender’s determination of Rating Agency criteria, shall be substituted therefor.(b)    Whenever, pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, a Rating Agency Confirmation is required from each applicable Rating Agency, in the event that any applicable Rating Agency “declines review”, “waives review” or otherwise indicates to Lender’s or Servicer’s satisfaction that no Rating Agency Confirmation will or needs to be issued with respect  to the matter in question (each, a “Review Waiver”), then the requirement to obtain a Rating Agency Confirmation from such Rating Agency shall not apply with respect to such matter; provided, however, if a Review Waiver occurs with respect to a Rating Agency and Lender does not have a separate and independent approval right with respect to the matter in question, then such matter shall require the written reasonable approval of Lender.  It is expressly agreed and understood, however, that receipt of a Review Waiver (i) from any one Rating Agency shall not be binding or apply with respect to any other Rating Agency and (ii) with respect to one matter shall not apply or be deemed to apply to any subsequent matter for which Rating Agency Confirmation is required.Section 10.3    Governing Law.(a)    THIS AGREEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AND MADE BY LENDER AND ACCEPTED BY BORROWER AND GUARANTORS IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AND THE PROCEEDS OF THE NOTE DELIVERED PURSUANT HERETO WERE DISBURSED FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WHICH STATE THE PARTIES AGREE HAS A SUBSTANTIAL RELATIONSHIP TO THE PARTIES AND TO THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION EMBODIED HEREBY, AND IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE, THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OBLIGATIONS ARISING HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE O

Borrower shall not be responsible for payment of the monthly master servicing fee due to the Servicer under the Servicing Agreement.

Upon such assignment, all references to Lender in this Agreement and in any Loan Document shall be deemed to refer to such assignee or successor in interest and such assignee or successor in interest shall thereafter stand in the place of Lender in all respects (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.10.6).  Borrower agrees that each beneficial owner of the Securities or component notes issued pursuant to Sections 9.1 and 9.3 shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.9 and 2.10 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.10.6).  Each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.9 and 2.10 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.10.6, it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.10.6 shall be delivered to the participating Lender) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment; provided that such participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment pursuant to Sections 2.9 or Section 2.10 than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change in law that occurs after the participant acquired the applicable participation.Section 10.24    Register and Participant Register.

The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.   Furthermore, each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts and stated interest of each participant’s interest in the Loan or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant’s interest) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the U.S. Department of Treasury regulations. The entries in the Register and Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Borrower, Lender and any of its successors and assigns, and the Registrar shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement and the participating Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register pursuant to the terms hereof as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement.

Lender agrees promptly to notify Borrower after any such set-off and application made by Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.Section 10.27    Cross-Default; Cross-Collateralization; Waiver of Marshalling of Assets.(a)    Borrower acknowledge that Lender has made the Loan to Borrower upon, among other things, the security of its collective interest in the Properties and in reliance upon the aggregate of the Properties taken together being of greater value as collateral security than the sum of each Property taken separately.  Borrower agrees that the Mortgages are and will be cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with each other so that (i) an Event of Default under any of the Mortgages shall constitute an Event of Default under each of the other Mortgages which secure the Note; (ii) an Event of Default under the Note or this Agreement shall constitute an Event of Default under each Mortgage; (iii) each Mortgage shall constitute security for the Note as if a single blanket lien were placed on all of the Properties as security for the Note; and (iv) such cross-collateralization shall in no event be deemed to constitute a fraudulent conveyance.(b)    To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower for itself and its successors and assigns, waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of Borrower, Borrower’s partners or members and of the Properties, or to a sale in inverse order of alienation in the event of foreclosure of all or any of the Mortgages, and agrees not to assert any right under any laws pertaining to the marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or any other matters whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender under the Loan Documents to a sale of the Properties for the collection of the Debt without any prior or different resort for collection or of the right of Lender to the payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of the Properties in preference to every other claimant whatsoever.  In addition, Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives in the event of foreclosure of any or all of the Mortgages, any equitable right otherwise available to Borrower which would require the separate sale of the Properties or require Lender to exhaust its remedies against any Property or any combination of the Properties before proceeding against any other Property or combination of Properties; and further in the event of such foreclosure Borrower does hereby expressly consents to and authorizes, at the option of Lender, the foreclosure and sale either separately or together of any combination of the Properties Section 10.28    Certificated Interests.(a)    If any ownership interest in an Equity Interest is represented by a certificate  (each, an “Equity Certificate”) that has been pledged and delivered to Lender and such Equity Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the written request of Lender to the applicable Loan Party, such Loan Party shall issue to Lender a new Equity Certificate in place of the Equity Certificate that was lost, stolen or destroyed, provided such Lender: (i) makes proof by written, notarized affidavit, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Loan Party that such previously issued Equity Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed and has not been assigned, endorsed, transferred or hypothecated, (ii) delivers a written indemnity (in form and substance and from an indemnitor reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Loan Party) to the extent required by any title company proposing to provide title insurance with respect to such Equity Certificate and (iii) requests the issuance of a new Equity Certificate before the Loan party has notice that such previously issued Equity Certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for value in good faith and without notice of an adverse claim.(b)    Upon repayment in full of the Loan, in the event Lender fails to return to a Loan Party an Equity Certificate previously delivered by such Loan Party to Lender in connection with the Loan, Lender shall deliver to the applicable Loan Party, within ten (10) days of such Loan Party’s demand, (i) a written, notarized affidavit, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Loan Party that such previously issued Equity Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed and has not been assigned, endorsed, transferred or hypothecated and (ii) a written indemnity (in form and substance and from an indemnitor reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Loan Party) to the extent required by any title company proposing to provide title insurance with respect to such Equity Certificate.Section 10.29    Exculpation of Lender.
