        Indebtedness, the following provisions shall apply:
 
(a)          any condition to such Limited Condition
          Acquisition or such Indebtedness that requires that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such Limited Condition Acquisition or the incurrence of such Indebtedness, shall be satisfied if (i) no
          Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of the execution of the definitive agreement governing such Limited Condition Acquisition (the “LCA Test Date”) and (ii) no

          materiality or reference to Material Adverse Effect, which such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects) as of the LCA Test Date, or if such representation speaks as of an earlier date, as of such earlier date and
          (ii) as of the date of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition, (A) the representations and warranties under the relevant definitive agreement governing such Limited Condition Acquisition as are material to the lenders providing such
          Indebtedness shall be true and correct, but only to the extent that such Borrower or its applicable Subsidiary has the right to terminate its obligations under such agreement or otherwise decline to close such Limited Condition Acquisition as a
          result of a breach of such representations and warranties or the failure of those representations and warranties to be true and correct and (B) certain of the representations and warranties in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents which are
          customary for similar “funds certain” financings and required by the lenders providing such Indebtedness shall be true and correct in all material respects (except for any representation and warranty that is qualified by materiality or reference
          to Material Adverse Effect, which such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects);
 

-79-

 

(c)          any financial ratio test or condition  to
          be tested in connection with such Limited Condition Acquisition and the availability of such Indebtedness will be tested as of the LCA Test Date, in each case, after giving effect to the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition and related
          incurrence of Indebtedness, on a Pro Forma Basis where applicable and assuming that all commitments with respect to such Indebtedness are fully funded, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) such ratios and baskets shall not be tested at the time
          of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition and (ii) if any of such ratios are exceeded or conditions are not met following the LCA Test Date, but prior to the closing of such Limited Condition Acquisition, as a result of fluctuations
          in such ratio or amount (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrowers or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Acquisition), at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such ratios will
          not be deemed to have been exceeded and such conditions will not be deemed unmet as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the relevant transaction or action is permitted to be consummated or taken;
 
(d)          except as provided in the next sentence, in
          connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio or basket on or following the relevant LCA Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Acquisition is consummated and the date that the definitive
          agreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition, any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis assuming such Limited Condition Acquisition
          and other transactions in connection therewith (including the incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness) have been consummated; provided that any calculation of any such ratio or basket under Section 6.6 and Section 6.7 shall be calculated (i) on a Pro Forma Basis assuming such Limited Condition Acquisition and other transactions in connection
          therewith (including the incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness) have been consummated and (ii) assuming such Limited Condition Acquisition and other transactions in connection therewith (including the incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness)
          have not been consummated.

          consummated.
 
The foregoing provisions shall apply with similar effect during the pendency of multiple Limited Condition Acquisitions such that each of the possible scenarios is
      separately tested.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions in this Section 1.7 shall not apply to the testing of satisfaction of the Payment Conditions, the calculation of any Excess Availability test, the testing of satisfaction of the
      Availability Conditions or the testing of conditions under Section 3.2.

1.9          Rates. The interest rate on Loans denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency may be determined by reference to a benchmark rate that is, or may
        in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform or cessation.  Regulators have signaled the need to use alternative reference rates for some of these benchmark rates and, as a result, such benchmark rates may cease to comply with applicable
        laws and regulations, may be permanently discontinued or the basis on which they are calculated may change.   Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with
        respect to (a) the continuation of, administration of, submission of, calculation of or any other matter related to any rates in the definition of any Benchmark, including the Term SOFR Reference Rate,
        Term SOFR, any Daily Simple RFR, the Eurocurrency Rate, or any other Benchmark, or any component definition thereof or rates referenced in the definition thereof, or with respect to any alternative, successor or replacement rate thereto (including
        any Benchmark Replacement), including whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any then-current Benchmark or any Benchmark Replacement) as it may or may not be adjusted pursuant to
        Section 2.12(d)(iii), will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, or have the same volume or liquidity as, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR, any Daily Simple RFR, the
        Eurocurrency Rate,  such Benchmark or any other Benchmark prior to its discontinuance or unavailability, or (b) the effect, implementation or composition of any Conforming Changes.  Agent and its affiliates or
        other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any Benchmark, any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) or any relevant adjustments thereto and such transactions may be
        adverse to Borrowers.  Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any Benchmark, any component definition thereof or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of
        this Agreement, and shall have no liability to any Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether
        in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service. Each determination of any Benchmark (or any Benchmark
        Replacement) shall be made by Agent and shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
 
1.10        Exchange Rates; Currency Equivalents.
 
(a)        Agent shall determine the Dollar Equivalent
          amounts of Loans or Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies.  Such Dollar Equivalent shall become effective as of such Revaluation Date and shall be the Dollar Equivalent of such amounts until the next Revaluation Date to occur.
 
(b)         Wherever in this Agreement in connection
          with a borrowing, conversion, continuation or prepayment of an Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a RFR Loan or the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit, an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars,
          but such borrowing, Loan or Letter of Credit is denominated in an Alternative Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Alternative Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount (rounded to the nearest unit of such Alternative Currency, with 0.5 of
          a unit being rounded upward), as determined by Agent.
 
(c)       All references in the Loan Documents to
          Loans, Letters of Credit, Obligations, Borrowing Base components and other amounts shall be denominated in Dollars, unless expressly provided otherwise.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the applicable amount of any Currency for
          purposes of the Loan Documents (including for purposes of financial statements and all calculations in connection with the covenants, including the financial covenant) shall be the Dollar Equivalent thereof as so determined by Agent  For purposes
          of determining compliance with Section 6 with respect to the amount of any Indebtedness, Investment, Lien, disposition of assets, or Restricted Payment or determining compliance with Section 8 with respect to the amount of judgments, the size of agreements and the value of Collateral, no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of changes in rates
          of exchange occurring after the times such Indebtedness, Investment, or Lien is incurred or disposition of assets or Restricted Payment is made. The Administrative Borrower shall report value and other Borrowing Base components to the Agent in
          Dollars, which shall be converted at the monthly accounting rate used by the Administrative Borrower (which rate shall be established by the Administrative Borrower in accordance with its historical practice in a manner approved by the Agent).
          Such conversion shall be subject to the Agent’s review and confirmation or adjustment including to reflect revaluation of Borrowing Base components at the Agent’s Spot Rate of Exchange if the Agent believes that there has been a material
          alteration in the exchange rate between the underlying currency of a Borrowing Base asset using the Administrative Borrower’s rate in accordance with the preceding sentence and the then current Dollar Equivalent thereof.

          Currency.

          payment denominated in the national currency unit of any member state of the European Union that adopts the Euro as its lawful currency after the date hereof shall be redenominated into Euro at the time of such adoption (in accordance with the
          EMU Legislation).  If, in relation to the currency of any such member state, the basis of accrual of interest expressed in this Agreement in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the London interbank
          market for the basis of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced by such convention or practice with effect from the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency; provided that
          if any borrowing in the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such borrowing, at the end of the then current Interest Period.
 
(b)        Each provision of this Agreement shall be
          subject to such reasonable changes of construction as Agent may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to
          the Euro.
 
(c)        Each provision of this Agreement also shall
          be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect a change in currency of any other country and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the change in currency.
 
1.12        Foreign Collateral. Notwithstanding any provision hereof or of any other Loan Document, (i) none of the German Loan Parties shall directly or indirectly Guarantee any Global Obligation or be liable to pay or otherwise be liable, in
          whole or in part, directly or indirectly, for any Global Obligation, and (ii) no German Collateral granted by the German Loan Parties as security for all or any part of the German Obligations, or any other credit enhancement provided by a
          non-U.S. obligor hereunder or under any Loan Document, shall directly or indirectly secure any Global Obligation. Notwithstanding any provision hereof or any other Loan Document, in the event that the Borrowers are required to pay any amounts
          under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents that are fees, costs or expenses that are not in the nature of interest or principal, if such amounts cannot be directly charged to either the applicable Global Borrowers or the German Borrower as
          specifically related to either the Global Obligations or the German Obligations, as applicable, then such amounts shall be paid by each of the Global Borrowers and the German Borrower pro rata based upon the total amount of the Obligations
          attributable to such Borrower outstanding at such time. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, any payment made by any German Loan Party with respect to the Obligations shall be made and treated solely as a
          payment with respect to the German Obligations.

1.13       Reclassification. For purposes of determining compliance with any of the covenants set forth in Section 6, if, at any time (whether at the time of incurrence or thereafter), any Lien, Investment, Indebtedness, Asset Disposition,
          Restricted Payment, prepayment of Indebtedness or Affiliate transaction meets the criteria of one, or more than one, of the categories permitted pursuant to Section 6, the Administrative Borrower (i) shall in its sole discretion determine under
          which category such Lien (other than Liens with respect to the Revolving Commitments), Investment, Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness consisting of Revolving Loans and Revolving Commitments), Asset Disposition, Restricted Payment, prepayment
          of Indebtedness or Affiliate transaction (or, in each case, any portion there) is permitted and (ii) shall be permitted, in its sole discretion, to make any re-determination and/or to divide, classify or reclassify under which category or
          categories such Lien, Investment, Indebtedness, Asset Disposition, Restricted Payment, prepayment of Indebtedness or Affiliate transaction is permitted from time to time as it may determine and without notice to the Agent or any Lender; provided that, in the case of any reclassification, the Administrative Borrower shall provide a certificate by a Responsible Officer with the calculation of any such reclassification.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 1.13 shall not apply to any transaction requiring the satisfaction of Payment Conditions.

2.           LOANS AND
        TERMS OF PAYMENT.
 
2.1          Revolving Loans.
 
(a)        Subject to the terms and conditions of this
          Agreement, and during the term of this Agreement, each Revolving Lender agrees (severally, not jointly or jointly and severally) to make revolving loans (“Global Revolving Loans”) in Dollars or in one
          or more Alternative Currencies to the Global Borrowers in an amount at any one time outstanding that will not result in the Availability Conditions not being met.
 

-83-

 

(b)        Subject to the terms and conditions of this
          Agreement, and during the term of this Agreement, each Revolving Lender agrees (severally, not jointly or jointly and severally) to make revolving loans (“German Revolving Loans”) in Euros or Dollars to
          the German Borrower in an amount at any one time outstanding that will not result in the Availability Conditions not being met.
 
(c)          Amounts borrowed pursuant to this Section 2.1 may be repaid and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, reborrowed at any time during the term of this Agreement.  The outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans,
          together with interest accrued and unpaid thereon, shall constitute Obligations and shall be due and payable on the Latest Maturity Date or, if earlier, on the date on which they otherwise become due and payable pursuant to the terms of this
          Agreement.
 
(d)          Anything to the contrary in this Section 2.1 notwithstanding, Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation) at any time, in the exercise of its Permitted Discretion, to establish and increase or decrease Reserves and against the
          Borrowing Base or the Maximum Revolver Amount. The amount of any Reserve established by Agent, and any changes to the eligibility criteria set forth in the definitions of Eligible Accounts, Eligible Inventory and Eligible Real Property shall have
          a reasonable relationship to the event, condition, other circumstance, or fact that is the basis for such reserve or change in eligibility and shall not be duplicative of any other reserve established and currently maintained or eligibility
          criteria.  Upon establishment or increase in Reserves, Agent agrees to make itself available to discuss the Reserve or increase, and Borrowers may take such action as may be required so that the event, condition, circumstance, or fact that is the
          basis for such reserve or increase no longer exists, in a manner and to the extent reasonably satisfactory to Agent in the exercise of its Permitted Discretion. In no event shall such opportunity limit the right of Agent to establish or change
          such Reserve, unless Agent shall have determined, in its Permitted Discretion, that the event, condition, other circumstance, or fact that was the basis for such Reserve or such change no longer exists or has otherwise been adequately addressed
          by Borrowers.
 
2.2          [Reserved].
 
2.3          Borrowing Procedures and Settlements.
 
(a)         Procedure for Borrowing Revolving Loans. Each Borrowing shall be made by a written request by an Authorized Person delivered to Agent (which may be delivered through Agent’s electronic platform or portal) and received by Agent no
          later than 11:00 a.m. (and in the case of any Borrowings in an Alternative Currency, London time) (i) on the Business Day that is the requested Funding Date in the case of a request for a Swing Loan, (ii) on the Business Day that is one (1)
          Business Day prior to the requested Funding Date in the case of a request for a Base Rate Loan, (iii) on the RFR Business Day that is three (3) RFR Business Days prior to the requested Funding Date in the case of a request for a SOFR Rate Loan,
          (iv) on the RFR Business Day that is five (5) RFR Business Days prior to the requested Funding Date in the case of a request for an RFR Loan (other than a SOFR Rate Loan), and (v) on the Eurocurrency Banking Day that is at least three (3)
          Eurocurrency Banking Days before the requested Funding Date in the case of request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, in each case, specifying (A) the amount of such Borrowing, (B) the Currency in which such Borrowing is to be made, (C) with respect
          to any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or SOFR Rate Loan, the Interest Period therefore and (D) the requested Funding Date (which shall be a Business Day); provided, that Agent may, in its sole discretion,
          elect to accept as timely requests that are received later than 11:00 a.m. on such RFR Business Day or Eurocurrency Banking Day, as applicable.  All Borrowing requests which are not made on-line via Agent’s electronic platform or portal shall be
          subject to (and unless Agent elects otherwise in the exercise of its sole discretion, such Borrowings shall not be made until the completion of) Agent’s authentication process (with results satisfactory to Agent) prior to the funding of any such
          requested Revolving Loan. If Borrowers fail to specify the Currency of a Loan in a request, then the applicable Loans shall be made in Dollars.  If Borrowers fail to specify a type of Loan to be denominated in Dollars or Canadian Dollars in a
          request, then the applicable Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans.  If Borrowers request a borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Rate Loans in any such request, but fail to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified
          an Interest Period of one month.
 

-84-

 

(b)        Making of Swing Loans.  In the case of a Global Revolving Loan denominated in Dollars or Canadian Dollars and so long as any of (i) the aggregate Dollar Equivalent amount of Swing Loans made since the last Settlement Date, minus all payments or other amounts applied to Swing Loans since the last Settlement Date, plus the Dollar Equivalent amount of the requested Swing Loan (A) does not result in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Swing Loans exceeding $30,000,000 and (B) does not result in the failure to satisfy
          the Availability Conditions, or (ii) each Swing Lender, in its sole discretion, agrees to make a Swing Loan notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, (A) the U.S. Swing Lender may make a Global Revolving Loan (any such Revolving Loan made by the
          U.S. Swing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) being referred to as a “U.S. Swing Loan” and all such Revolving Loans being referred to as “U.S. Swing Loans”) available to Global Borrowers on the Funding Date applicable thereto by transferring immediately available funds in Dollars in the amount of such Borrowing to the applicable Designated
          Account and (B) the Canadian Swing Lender may make a Global Revolving Loan (any such Revolving Loan made by the Canadian Swing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) being referred to as a “Canadian Swing Loan” and all such Revolving Loans being referred to as “Canadian Swing Loans”) available to Global Borrowers on the Funding Date applicable
          thereto by transferring immediately available funds in Canadian Dollars in the amount of such Borrowing to the applicable Designated Account; provided, that the sum of the Dollar Equivalent of the
          aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Canadian Swing Loans shall not exceed the Canadian Swing Loan Sublimit. Each Swing Loan shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder and shall be subject to all the terms and conditions (including
          Section 3) applicable to other Revolving Loans, except that all payments (including interest) on any Swing Loan shall be payable to the applicable Swing Lender solely for its own account.  Subject to
          the provisions of Section 2.3(d)(ii), no Swing Lender shall make nor shall be obligated to make any Swing Loan if such Swing Lender has actual knowledge that (i) one or more of the applicable
          conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing, or (ii) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Availability on such
          Funding Date.  No Swing Lender shall otherwise be required to determine whether the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 have been satisfied on the Funding Date applicable thereto
          prior to making any Swing Loan.  The Swing Loans shall be secured by Agent’s Liens, constitute Global Revolving Loans and Global Obligations, and bear interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans.
 

-85-

 

(c)          Making of Revolving Loans.
 
(i)         In the event that a Swing Lender is not
          obligated to make a Swing Loan, then after receipt of a request for a Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.3(a), Agent shall notify the Lenders by telecopy, telephone, email, or other electronic form of
          transmission, of the requested Borrowing; such notification to be sent on the Business Day or RFR Business Day, as applicable that is (A) in the case of a Base Rate Loan, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the requested Funding Date, (B) in
          the case of a request for a SOFR Rate Loan, prior to 11:00 a.m. at least three (3) RFR Business Days prior to the requested Funding Date, (C) in the case of a request for a RFR Loan (other than a SOFR Rate Loan), prior to 11:00 a.m. at least five
          (5) RFR Business Days prior to the requested Funding Date, or (D) in the case of request for  a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, prior to 11:00 a.m. at least three (3) Eurocurrency Banking Days prior to the requested Funding Date. If Agent has notified
          the Lenders of a requested Borrowing on the Business Day that is one Business Day prior to the Funding Date, then each Lender shall make the amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the requested Borrowing available to Agent in immediately
          available funds in the applicable Currency, to the applicable Agent’s Account, not later than 10:00 a.m. on the Business Day that is the requested Funding Date.  Each Lender may at its option make any Revolving Loan by causing any domestic or
          foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Revolving Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not (i) limit or expand the obligation of the Borrowers to repay such Revolving Loan in accordance with the terms of this
          Agreement or cause the Borrowers to pay increased additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.12(d) at the time of such exercise or (ii) excuse or relieve any Lender from its Commitment to make any such Loan to the extent not so made by such branch
          or Affiliate.  After Agent’s receipt of the proceeds of such Revolving Loans from the Lenders, Agent shall make the proceeds thereof available to Borrowers on the applicable Funding Date by transferring immediately available funds in the
          applicable Currency equal to such proceeds received by Agent to the applicable Designated Account; provided, that subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(d)(ii),
          no Lender shall have an obligation to make any Revolving Loan, if (1) one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for
          the applicable Borrowing unless such condition has been waived, or (2) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Availability on such Funding Date.
 
(ii)        Unless Agent receives notice from a Lender
          prior to 9:30 a.m. on the Business Day that is the requested Funding Date relative to a requested Borrowing as to which Agent has notified the Lenders of a requested Borrowing that such Lender will not make available as and when required
          hereunder to Agent for the account of Borrowers the amount of that Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, Agent may assume that each Lender has made or will make such amount available to Agent in immediately available funds in the applicable
          Currency on the Funding Date and Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrowers a corresponding amount.  If, on the requested Funding Date, any Lender shall not have remitted the full
          amount that it is required to make available to Agent in immediately available funds in the applicable Currency and if Agent has made available to Borrowers such amount on the requested Funding Date, then such Lender shall make the amount of such
          Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the requested Borrowing available to Agent in immediately available funds in the applicable Currency, to the applicable Agent’s Account, no later than 10:00 a.m. on the Business Day that is the first Business Day after
          the requested Funding Date (in which case, the interest accrued on such Lender’s portion of such Borrowing for the Funding Date shall be for Agent’s separate account).  If any Lender shall not remit the full amount that it is required to make
          available to Agent in immediately available funds in the applicable Currency as and when required hereby and if Agent has made available to Borrowers such amount, then that Lender shall be obligated to immediately remit such amount to Agent,
          together with interest at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day until the date on which such amount is so remitted.  A notice submitted by Agent to any Lender with respect to amounts owing under this Section
              2.3(c)(ii) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  If the amount that a Lender is required to remit is made available to Agent, then such payment to Agent shall constitute such Lender’s Revolving Loan for all purposes of this
          Agreement.  If such amount is not made available to Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date, Agent will notify Administrative Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by Agent, Borrowers shall pay such amount to Agent for
          Agent’s account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Loans composing such Borrowing.

(d)          Protective Advances and Optional Overadvances.
 
(i)          Any contrary provision of this Agreement or
          any other Loan Document notwithstanding (but subject to Section 2.3(d)(iv)), at any time (A) after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, or (B) that any of the
          other applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 are not satisfied, Agent hereby is authorized by Borrowers and the Lenders, from time to time, in Agent’s sole discretion, (I) to make
          Global Revolving Loans in Dollars or any Alternative Currency to, or for the benefit of, Global Borrowers, on behalf of the Global Revolving Lenders, that Agent, in its Permitted Discretion, deems necessary or desirable (1) to preserve or protect
          the Global Collateral, or any portion thereof, or (2) to enhance the likelihood of repayment of the Global Obligations (other than the Global Bank Product Obligations) (the Global Revolving Loans described in this Section 2.3(d)(i)(I) shall be
          referred to as “Global Protective Advances”) and (II) to make German Revolving Loans in Euros or Dollars to, or for the benefit of, the German Borrower, on behalf of the German Revolving Lenders, that
          Agent, in its Permitted Discretion, deems necessary or desirable (1) to preserve or protect the German Collateral, or any portion thereof, or (2) to enhance the likelihood of repayment of the German Obligations (other than the German Bank Product
          Obligations) (the German Revolving Loans described in this Section 2.3(d)(i)(II) shall be referred to as “German Protective Advances”).  In any event (x) if any Protective Advance of any applicable
          Facility remains outstanding for more than 30 days, unless otherwise agreed to by the Required Lenders, Borrowers of the applicable Facility shall immediately repay such Protective Advance, and (y) after the date all such Protective Advances have
          been repaid, there must be at least five consecutive days before additional Protective Advances are made pursuant to this Section 2.3(d)(i).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the aggregate amount of
          all Global Protective Advances outstanding at any one time shall not exceed, together with all Global Overadvances outstanding at any time, 10% of the Global Borrowing Base and (y) the aggregate amount of all German Protective Advances
          outstanding at any one time shall not exceed, together with all German Overadvances outstanding at any time, 10% of the German Borrowing Base. Agent’s and Swing Lenders’ authorization to make Protective Advances may be revoked at any time by the
          Required Lenders delivering written notice of such revocation to Agent.  Any such revocation shall become effective prospectively upon Agent’s receipt thereof.
 
(ii)         Any contrary provision of this Agreement
          or any other Loan Document notwithstanding, the Lenders hereby authorize Agent or the Swing Lenders, as applicable, and either Agent or the Swing Lenders, as applicable, may, but is not obligated to, knowingly and intentionally, continue to make
          Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans) to Borrowers notwithstanding that an Overadvance exists or would be created thereby, so long as (A) after giving effect to any such Global Revolving Loans, the outstanding Revolver Usage in respect of the
          Global Revolving Facility does not exceed the Global Borrowing Base by more than 10% of the Global Borrowing Base and (B)  after giving effect to any such German Revolving Loans, the outstanding Revolver Usage in respect of the German Revolving
          Facility does not exceed the German Borrowing Base by more than 10% of the German Borrowing Base, and (B) subject to Section 2.3(d)(iv) below, after giving effect to such Revolving Loans, the
          outstanding Revolver Usage (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) does not exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount.  In the event Agent obtains actual knowledge that the applicable
          Revolver Usage exceeds the amounts permitted by this Section 2.3(d), regardless of the amount of, or reason for, such excess, Agent shall notify the Lenders as soon as practicable (and prior to making
          any (or any additional) intentional Overadvances (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) unless Agent determines that prior notice would result in imminent harm to the applicable
          Collateral or its value, in which case Agent may make such Overadvances and provide notice as promptly as practicable thereafter), and the Lenders with Revolver Commitments thereupon shall, together with Agent, jointly determine the terms of
          arrangements that shall be implemented with Borrowers intended to reduce, within a reasonable time, the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans to Borrowers to an amount permitted by the preceding sentence.  In such circumstances, if
          any Lender with a Revolver Commitment objects to the proposed terms of reduction or repayment of any Overadvance, the terms of reduction or repayment thereof shall be implemented according to the determination of the Required Lenders.  In any
          event (x) if any Overadvance not otherwise made or permitted pursuant to this Section 2.3(d) remains outstanding for more than 30 days, unless otherwise agreed to by the Required Lenders, applicable
          Borrowers shall immediately repay the applicable Revolving Loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate all such applicable Overadvances not otherwise made or permitted to this Section 2.3(d), and (y)
          after the date all such Overadvances have been eliminated, there must be at least five consecutive days before additional Revolving Loans are made pursuant to this Section 2.3(d)(ii).  The foregoing
          provisions are meant for the benefit of the Lenders and Agent and are not meant for the benefit of Borrowers, which shall continue to be bound by the provisions of Section 2.4(e)(i).  Agent’s and Swing
          Lenders’ authorization to make intentional Overadvances may be revoked at any time by the Required Lenders delivering written notice of such revocation to Agent.  Any such revocation shall become effective prospectively upon Agent’s receipt
          thereof.
 

-87-

 

(iii)       Each Protective Advance and each
          Overadvance (each, an “Extraordinary Advance”) shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder; provided that any outstanding Extraordinary Advances denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than
          Canadian Dollars) shall be automatically and immediately converted into Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency).  Prior to Settlement of any Extraordinary Advance, all
          payments with respect thereto, including interest thereon, shall be payable to Agent solely for its own account. Each Revolving Lender shall be obligated to settle with Agent as provided in Section 2.3(e)
          (or Section 2.3(g), as applicable) for the amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of any Extraordinary Advance.  The Extraordinary Advances shall be repayable on demand, secured by Agent’s Liens,
          constitute Obligations hereunder, and bear interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans.  The provisions of this Section 2.3(d) are for the exclusive
          benefit of Agent, Swing Lenders, and the Lenders and are not intended to benefit Borrowers (or any other Loan Party) in any way.
 
(iv)         Notwithstanding anything contained in this
          Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, no Extraordinary Advance may be made by Agent if such Extraordinary Advance would cause clauses (a) or (e) of the Availability Conditions not to be satisfied; provided
          that Agent may make Extraordinary Advances in excess of the foregoing limitations so long as such Extraordinary Advances that cause clauses (a) or (e) of the Availability Conditions not to be satisfied  are for Agent’s sole and separate account
          and not for the account of any Lender.  No Lender shall have an obligation to settle with Agent for such Extraordinary Advances that cause clauses (a) or (e) of the Availability Conditions not to be satisfied as provided in Section 2.3(e) (or Section 2.3(g), as applicable).
 
(e)         Settlement.  It is agreed that each Lender’s funded portion of the Revolving Loans is intended by the Lenders to equal, at all times, such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the
          outstanding Revolving Loans.  Such agreement notwithstanding, Agent, Swing Lenders, and the other Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be for the benefit of Borrowers) that in order to facilitate the administration of this Agreement and the
          other Loan Documents, settlement among the Lenders as to the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) shall take place on a periodic basis in accordance with the following provisions:
 

-88-

 

(i)          Agent shall request settlement (“Settlement”) with the Lenders on a weekly basis, or on a more frequent basis if so determined by Agent in its sole discretion (1) on behalf of Swing Lenders, with respect to the outstanding Swing Loans, (2)
          for itself, with respect to the outstanding Extraordinary Advances, and (3) with respect to any Loan Party’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ payments or other amounts received, as to each by notifying the Lenders by telecopy, telephone, or other
          similar form of transmission, of such requested Settlement, no later than 2:00 p.m. (and in the case of any Settlements in an Alternative Currency (other than Canadian Dollars), London time) on the Business Day immediately prior to the date of
          such requested Settlement (the date of such requested Settlement being the “Settlement Date”).  Such notice of a Settlement Date shall include a summary statement of the amount of outstanding Revolving
          Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) for the period since the prior Settlement Date.  Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein (including Section 2.3(g)):  (y) if the
          amount of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) made by a Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender exceeds such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) as of
          a Settlement Date, then Agent shall, by no later than 12:00 p.m. (and in the case of any Settlements in an Alternative Currency, London time)  on the Settlement Date, transfer in immediately available funds to a Deposit Account of such Lender (as
          such Lender may designate), an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have as of the Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances), and (z) if the
          amount of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) made by a Lender is less than such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) as of a Settlement Date, such
          Lender shall no later than 12:00 p.m. on the Settlement Date transfer in immediately available funds in the applicable Currency to the applicable Agent’s Account, an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon transfer of such amount, have as
          of the Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances).  Such amounts made available to Agent under clause (z) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be applied against the
          amounts of the applicable Swing Loans or Extraordinary Advances and, together with the portion of such Swing Loans or Extraordinary Advances representing the applicable Swing Lender’s Pro Rata Share thereof, shall constitute Revolving Loans of
          such Lenders.  If any such amount is not made available to Agent by any Lender on the Settlement Date applicable thereto to the extent required by the terms hereof, Agent shall be entitled to recover for its account such amount on demand from
          such Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate.
 
(ii)        In determining whether a Lender’s balance
          of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) is less than, equal to, or greater than such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) as of a Settlement Date,
          Agent shall, as part of the relevant Settlement, apply to such balance the portion of payments actually received in good funds by Agent with respect to principal, interest, fees payable by Borrowers and allocable to the Lenders hereunder, and
          proceeds of Collateral.
 

-89-

 

(iii)       Between Settlement Dates, Agent, to the
          extent Extraordinary Advances or Swing Loans are outstanding, may pay over to Agent or Swing Lenders, as applicable, any payments or other amounts received by Agent, that in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied to the
          reduction of the Revolving Loans, for application to the Extraordinary Advances or Swing Loans.  Between Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent no Extraordinary Advances or Swing Loans are outstanding, may pay over to Swing Lenders any payments
          or other amounts received by Agent, that in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Revolving Loans, for application to Swing Lenders’ Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans.  If, as of any Settlement
          Date, payments or other amounts of the Loan Parties or their Subsidiaries received since the then immediately preceding Settlement Date have been applied to Swing Lenders’ Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans other than to Swing Loans, as
          provided for in the previous sentence, Swing Lenders shall pay to Agent for the accounts of the Lenders, and Agent shall pay to the Lenders (other than a Defaulting Lender if Agent has implemented the provisions of Section

              2.3(g)), to be applied to the outstanding Revolving Loans of such Lenders, an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have, as of such Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans. 
          During the period between Settlement Dates, Swing Lenders with respect to Swing Loans, Agent with respect to Extraordinary Advances, and each Lender with respect to the Revolving Loans other than Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances, shall be
          entitled to interest at the applicable rate or rates payable under this Agreement on the daily amount of funds employed by Swing Lenders, Agent or the Lenders, as applicable.
 
(iv)        Anything in this Section 2.3(e) to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, Agent shall be entitled to refrain from remitting settlement amounts to the Defaulting Lender and, instead, shall be entitled
          to elect to implement the provisions set forth in Section 2.3(g).
 
(f)         Notation.  Consistent with Section 13.1(h), Agent, as a non-fiduciary agent for Borrowers, shall maintain a register showing the
          principal amount and stated interest of the Revolving Loans and the applicable Currency, owing to each Lender, including the Swing Loans owing to Swing Lenders, and Extraordinary Advances owing to Agent, and the interests therein of each Lender,
          from time to time and such register shall, absent manifest error, conclusively be presumed to be correct and accurate.

(g)          Defaulting Lenders.
 
(i)         Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(b)(iii) or (iv), Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments made by Borrowers to Agent for the Defaulting Lender’s
          benefit or any proceeds of Collateral that would otherwise be remitted hereunder to the Defaulting Lender, and, in the absence of such transfer to the Defaulting Lender, Agent shall transfer any such payments (A) first, to Agent to the extent of
          any Extraordinary Advances that were made by Agent and that were required to be, but were not, paid by Defaulting Lender, (B) second, to Swing Lenders to the extent of any Swing Loans that were made by Swing Lenders and that were required to be,
          but were not, paid by the Defaulting Lender, (C) third, to Issuing Bank, to the extent of the portion of a Letter of Credit Disbursement that was required to be, but was not, paid by the Defaulting Lender, (D) fourth, to each Non-Defaulting
          Lender ratably in accordance with their Commitments (but, in each case, only to the extent that such Defaulting Lender’s portion of a Revolving Loan (or other funding obligation) was funded by such other Non-Defaulting Lender), (E) fifth, in
          Agent’s sole discretion, to a suspense account maintained by Agent, the proceeds of which shall be retained by Agent and may be made available to be re-advanced to or for the benefit of Borrowers (upon the request of Borrowers and subject to the
          conditions set forth in Section 3.2) as if such Defaulting Lender had made its portion of Revolving Loans (or other funding obligations) hereunder, and (F) sixth, from and after the date on which all
          other Obligations have been paid in full, to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with tier (L) of Section 2.4(b)(iii) or (iv), as applicable.  Subject to
          the foregoing, Agent may hold and, in its discretion, re-lend to Borrowers for the account of such Defaulting Lender the amount of all such payments received and retained by Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender.  Solely for the
          purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents (including the calculation of Pro Rata Share in connection therewith) and for the purpose of calculating the fee payable under Section

              2.10(b), such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a “Lender” and such Lender’s Commitment shall be deemed to be zero; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to any of the
          matters governed by Section 14.1(a)(i) through (iii).  The provisions of this Section 2.3(g) shall remain
          effective with respect to such Defaulting Lender until the earlier of (y) the date on which all of the Non-Defaulting Lenders, Agent, Issuing Bank, and Borrowers shall have waived, in writing, the application of this Section 2.3(g) to such Defaulting Lender, or (z) the date on which such Defaulting Lender makes payment of all amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, pays to Agent all amounts owing by Defaulting Lender in respect
          of the amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, and, if requested by Agent, provides adequate assurance of its ability to perform its future obligations hereunder (on which earlier date, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
          continuing, any remaining cash collateral held by Agent pursuant to Section 2.3(g)(ii) shall be released to Borrowers).  The operation of this Section 2.3(g)
          shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, to relieve or excuse the performance by such Defaulting Lender or any other Lender of its duties and obligations hereunder, or to relieve or excuse the
          performance by any Borrower of its duties and obligations hereunder to Agent, Issuing Bank, or to the Lenders other than such Defaulting Lender.  Any failure by a Defaulting Lender to fund amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder shall
          constitute a material breach by such Defaulting Lender of this Agreement and shall entitle Borrowers, at their option, upon written notice to Agent, to arrange for a substitute Lender to assume the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, such
          substitute Lender to be reasonably acceptable to Agent.  In connection with the arrangement of such a substitute Lender, the Defaulting Lender shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder, and agrees to execute and deliver a completed
          form of Assignment and Acceptance in favor of the substitute Lender (and agrees that it shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such document if it fails to do so) subject only to being paid its share of the outstanding Obligations (other
          than Bank Product Obligations, but including (1) all interest, fees, and other amounts that may be due and payable in respect thereof, and (2) an assumption of its Pro Rata Share of its participation in the Letters of Credit); provided, that any such assumption of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any of the Lender Groups’ or Borrowers’ rights or remedies against any such
          Defaulting Lender arising out of or in relation to such failure to fund.  In the event of a direct conflict between the priority provisions of this Section 2.3(g) and any other provision contained in
          this Agreement or any other Loan Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other.  In the event of any actual,
          irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this Section 2.3(g) shall control and govern.
 
(ii)          If any Swing Loan or Letter of Credit is outstanding at
        the time that a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
 
(A)          such Defaulting Lender’s Swing Loan
          Exposure and Letter of Credit Exposure shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares but only to the extent (x) the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Pro Rata Share of Revolver Usage
          plus such Defaulting Lender’s Swing Loan Exposure and Letter of Credit Exposure does not exceed the total of all Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolver Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 3.2 are satisfied at such time;
 

-91-

 

(B)        if the reallocation described in clause (A)
          above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, Borrowers shall within one Business Day following notice by Agent (x) first, prepay such Defaulting Lender’s Swing Loan Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause
          (A) above), and (y) second, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (A) above), pursuant to a cash collateral
            agreement to be entered into in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent, for so long as such Letter of Credit Exposure is outstanding; provided, that Borrowers shall not be
          obligated to cash collateralize any Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure if such Defaulting Lender is also Issuing Bank;
 
(C)        if Borrowers cash collateralize any portion
          of such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii), Borrowers shall not be required to pay any Letter of Credit Fees to Agent for the account of such Defaulting
          Lender pursuant to Section 2.6(b) with respect to such cash collateralized portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure during the period such Letter of Credit Exposure is cash
          collateralized;
 
(D)          to the extent the Letter of Credit
          Exposure of the Non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii), then the Letter of Credit Fees payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders pursuant to Section 2.6(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Letter of Credit Exposure;
 
(E)         to the extent any Defaulting Lender’s
          Letter of Credit Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder,
          all Letter of Credit Fees that would have otherwise been payable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.6(b) with respect to such portion of such Letter of Credit Exposure shall instead be payable
          to Issuing Bank until such portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure is cash collateralized or reallocated;
 
(F)          so long as any Lender is a Defaulting
          Lender, the Swing Lenders shall not be required to make any Swing Loan and Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend, or increase any Letter of Credit, in each case, to the extent (x) the Defaulting Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such Swing
          Loans or Letter of Credit cannot be reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii), or (y) the Swing Lenders or Issuing Bank, as applicable, has not otherwise entered into arrangements reasonably
          satisfactory to the Swing Lenders or Issuing Bank, as applicable, and Borrowers to eliminate the Swing Lenders’ or Issuing Bank’s risk with respect to the Defaulting Lender’s participation in Swing Loans or Letters of Credit; and
 
(G)         Agent may release any cash collateral
          provided by Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii) to Issuing Bank and Issuing Bank may apply any such cash collateral to the payment of such Defaulting Lender’s Pro Rata Share of any Letter of
          Credit Disbursement that is not reimbursed by Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.11(d).  Subject to Section 17.15, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a
          waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased
          exposure following such reallocation.
 
(h)       Independent Obligations.  All Revolving Loans (other than Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) shall be made by the Lenders contemporaneously and in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares.  It is understood that (i) no Lender
          shall be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loan (or other extension of credit) hereunder, nor shall any Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by
          any other Lender to perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) no failure by any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder shall excuse any other Lender from its obligations hereunder.

2.4          Payments; Reductions of Commitments; Prepayments.
 
(a)          Payments by Borrowers.
 
(i)          Except as otherwise expressly provided
          herein, all payments by Borrowers shall be made to the applicable Agent’s Account for the account of the Lender Group and shall be made in immediately available funds in Dollars; provided, that all
          principal and  interest payments made on account of Revolving Loans or Letters of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency shall instead be made in such Alternative Currency, no later than 1:30 p.m. (and in the case of any payments in an
          Alternative Currency (other than Canadian Dollars), London time)  on the date specified herein; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any payments deposited into a Controlled Account shall be
          deemed not to be received by Agent on any Business Day unless immediately available funds have been credited to the applicable Agent’s Account prior to 1:30 p.m. (and in the case of any payments in an Alternative Currency, London time)   on such
          Business Day.  Any payment received by Agent in immediately available funds in any Agent’s Account later than 1:30 p.m. (and in the case of any payments in an Alternative Currency, London time)  shall be deemed to have been received (unless
          Agent, in its sole discretion, elects to credit it on the date received) on the following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue until such following Business Day.
 
(ii)         Unless Agent receives notice from
          Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that Borrowers will not make such payment in full as and when required, Agent may assume that Borrowers have made (or will make) such payment in full to Agent on such date in
          immediately available funds and Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.  If and to the extent Borrowers do not make
          such payment in full to Agent on the date when due, each Lender severally shall repay to Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day from the date such amount
          is distributed to such Lender until the date repaid.
 
(b)          Apportionment and Application.
 
(i)       So long as no Application Event has occurred
          and is continuing and except as otherwise provided herein with respect to Defaulting Lenders, all principal and interest payments received by Agent shall be apportioned ratably among the Lenders (according to the unpaid principal balance of the
          Obligations to which such payments relate held by each Lender) and all payments of fees and expenses received by Agent (other than fees or expenses that are for Agent’s separate account or for the separate account of Issuing Bank) shall be
          apportioned ratably among the Lenders having a Pro Rata Share of the type of Commitment or Obligation to which a particular fee or expense relates.
 
(ii)        Subject to Section

              2.4(b)(vi) and Section 2.4(e), all payments to be made hereunder by Borrowers shall be remitted to Agent and all such payments, and all proceeds of Collateral received by Agent, shall be
          applied, so long as no Application Event has occurred and is continuing and except as otherwise provided herein with respect to Defaulting Lenders, to reduce the balance of the Revolving Loans outstanding and, thereafter, to Borrowers (to be
          wired to the applicable Designated Account) or such other Person entitled thereto under applicable law.
 

-93-

 

(iii)       At any time that an Application Event has
          occurred and is continuing and except as otherwise provided herein with respect to Defaulting Lenders, all payments remitted to Agent (other than proceeds of German Collateral or on account of or received from the German Loan Parties) and all
          proceeds of Global Collateral received by or remitted to Agent in respect thereof shall be applied to the Global Revolving Facility as follows:

          Commitments of such Facility in effect immediately prior to such reduction are less than $5,000,000), shall be made by providing not less than five Business Days prior written notice to Agent, and if made for all of the Revolver Commitments may
          be conditional.  The Revolver Commitments, once reduced, may not be increased.  Each such reduction of the Revolver Commitments shall reduce the Revolver Commitments of each Lender proportionately in accordance with its ratable share thereof.  In
          connection with any reduction in the Revolver Commitments prior to the Latest Maturity Date, if any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries owns any Margin Stock, Borrowers shall deliver to Agent an updated Form U-1 (with sufficient additional
          originals thereof for each Lender), duly executed and delivered by Borrowers, together with such other documentation as Agent shall reasonably request, in order to enable Agent and the Lenders to comply with any of the requirements under

(i)          Borrowing Base.  If, at any time, the Availability Conditions are not satisfied, then Borrowers shall promptly, but in any event, within one Business Day, prepay the Obligations in accordance with Section

(f)          Application of Payments.
 
(i)         Each prepayment pursuant to Section 2.4(e)(i) shall, (1) so long as no Application Event shall have occurred and be continuing, be applied, first, to the outstanding principal
          amount of the Revolving Loans in respect of the applicable Facility subject to such mandatory prepayment until paid in full, and second, to cash collateralize the Letters of Credit in
          respect of the applicable Facility subject to such mandatory prepayment in the applicable Currency in which such Letters of Credit were issued in an amount equal to (i) 105% of the Letter of Credit Usage with respect to Letters of Credit
          denominated in Dollars, plus (ii) 110% of the applicable Letter of Credit Usage with respect to Letters of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, and (2) if an Application Event shall have occurred and be continuing, be applied in the
          manner set forth in Section 2.4(b)(iii) and (iv).
 
2.5          Promise to Pay; Promissory Notes.
 
(a)        Borrowers agree to pay the Lender Group
          Expenses on the earlier of (i) the first day of the month following the date on which the applicable Lender Group Expenses were first incurred, or (ii) the date on which demand therefor is made by Agent (it being acknowledged and agreed that any
          charging of such costs, expenses or Lender Group Expenses to the Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.6(d) shall be deemed to constitute a demand for payment thereof for the purposes of
          this subclause (ii)).  Borrowers promise to pay all of the Obligations (including principal, interest, premiums, if any, fees, costs, and expenses (including Lender Group Expenses)) in full on the Latest Maturity Date or,
          if earlier, on the date on which the Obligations (other than the Bank Product Obligations) become due and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  Borrowers agree that their obligations contained in the first sentence of this Section 2.5(a) shall survive payment or satisfaction in full of all other Obligations.

(b)         Any Lender may request that any portion of
          its Commitments or the Loans made by it be evidenced by one or more promissory notes.  In such event, Borrowers shall execute and deliver to such Lender the requested promissory notes payable to the order of such Lender in a form furnished by
          Agent and reasonably satisfactory to Borrowers.  Thereafter, the portion of the Commitments and Loans evidenced by such promissory notes and interest thereon shall at all times be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable
          to the order of the payee named therein.

(c)         Default Rate.  If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan, or (ii) any interest payable thereon or any other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when
          due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall (i) automatically upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default under Section 8.4
          or 8.5, and (ii) upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any other Event of Default (other than an Event of Default under Section 8.4 or 8.5), upon the direction of Agent or the Required Lenders bear interest at a rate per annum that

          Documents, and all other Lender Group Expenses shall be due and payable on (x) with respect to Lender Group Expenses outstanding as of the Closing Date, the Closing Date, and (y) otherwise, the earlier of (A) the first day of the month following
          the date on which the applicable costs, expenses, or Lender Group Expenses were first incurred, or (B) the date on which demand therefor is made by Agent (it being acknowledged and agreed that any charging of such costs, expenses or Lender Group
          Expenses to the Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of the following sentence shall be deemed to constitute a demand for payment thereof for the purposes of this subclause (y)).  Borrowers hereby authorize Agent, from time to time without
          prior notice to Borrowers, to charge to the Loan Account (A) on the first day of each quarter (or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, on the first day of each month), all interest accrued during the prior quarter (or if an
          Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, month) on the Revolving Loans hereunder, (B) on the first Business Day of each quarter (or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, on the first Business Day of each month), all
          Letter of Credit Fees accrued or chargeable hereunder during the prior quarter (or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, during the prior month), (C) as and when incurred or accrued, all fees and costs provided for in Section 2.10(a) or (c), (D) on the first day of each quarter (or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, during the prior month), the Unused Line

          under any other Loan Document or under any Bank Product Agreement) charged to the Loan Account shall thereupon constitute Revolving Loans hereunder, shall constitute Obligations hereunder, and shall initially accrue interest at the rate then
          applicable to Revolving Loans that are (x) with respect to any such payments made in Dollars or Canadian Dollars, Base Rate Loans (unless and until converted into Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Rate Loans in accordance with the terms of this
          Agreement) or (y) with respect to any such payments made in a Currency other than Dollars or Canadian Dollars, Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Daily Simple RFR Loans, as applicable, denominated in such Currency.

(e)         Computation.  All interest and fees chargeable under the Loan Documents shall be computed on the basis of a 360 day year other than for Canadian Base Rate Loans which shall
          be calculated on the basis of 365 or 366 day year, as applicable, in each case, for the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which the interest or fees accrue.  In the event the Base Rate is changed from time to time hereafter, the
          rates of interest hereunder based upon the Base Rate automatically and immediately shall be increased or decreased by an amount equal to such change in the Base Rate. Interest on Loans denominated in any Alternative Currency as to which market
          practice differs from the foregoing shall be computed in accordance with market practice for such Loans.
 
(f)          Intent to Limit Charges to Maximum Lawful Rate.  In no event shall the interest rate or rates payable under this Agreement, plus any other amounts paid in connection herewith, exceed the highest rate permissible under any law that a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable.  Borrowers and the Lender
          Group, in executing and delivering this Agreement, intend legally to agree upon the rate or rates of interest and manner of payment stated within it; provided, that anything contained herein to the
          contrary notwithstanding, if such rate or rates of interest or manner of payment exceeds the maximum allowable under applicable law, then, ipso facto, as of the date of this Agreement,
          Borrowers are and shall be liable only for the payment of such maximum amount as is allowed by law, and payment received from Borrowers in excess of such legal maximum, whenever received, shall be applied to reduce the principal balance of the
          Obligations to the extent of such excess.
 
(g)          Interest Act (Canada).  For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada) and disclosure thereunder only, (i) whenever
          any interest or fee payable by any Loan Party is calculated using a rate based on a year of 360 or 365 days, as the case may be, the rate determined pursuant to such calculation, when expressed as an annual rate, is equivalent to (x) the
          applicable rate based on a year of 360 days or 365 days, as the case may be, (y) multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in which such rate is to be ascertained and (z) divided by 360 or 365, as the case may be, (ii) the
          principle of deemed reinvestment of interest does not apply to any interest calculation under this Agreement and (iii) the rates of interest stipulated in this Agreement are intended to be nominal rates and not effective rates or yields.
 
(h)          Criminal Code.  Without limitation to Section 2.6(f), if any provision of this Agreement or of any of the other Loan Documents would obligate the Canadian Borrower to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to the
          Agent or any Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in an amount or calculated at a rate which would be prohibited by law or would result in a receipt by the Agent or any Lender of interest at a criminal rate (as such terms are
          construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)) then, notwithstanding such provisions, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so
          prohibited by law or so result in a receipt by the Agent or any Lender of interest at a criminal rate, such adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, as follows: (1) firstly, by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be
          paid to the Agent or any Lender under this Section 11, and (2) thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and other amounts required to be paid to the Agent or any Lender which would constitute “interest” for purposes of Section 347
          of the Criminal Code (Canada). Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after giving effect to all adjustments contemplated thereby, if the Agent or any Lender shall have received an amount in excess of the maximum permitted by that Section of the
          Criminal Code (Canada), the Canadian Borrower shall be entitled, by notice in writing to the Agent or the applicable Lender, to obtain reimbursement from such party in an amount equal to such excess and, pending such reimbursement, such amount
          shall be deemed to be an amount payable by the Agent or applicable Lender to the Canadian Borrower. Any amount or rate of interest referred to in this Section 11 shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices and
          principles as an effective annual rate of interest over the term that the applicable loan remains outstanding with the assumption that any charges, fees or expenses that fall within the meaning of “interest” (as defined in the Criminal Code
          (Canada)) shall be included in the calculation of such effective rate and, in the event of a dispute, a certificate of a Fellow of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries appointed by the Agent shall be conclusive for the purposes of such
          determination.

2.7        Crediting Payments.  The receipt of any payment item by Agent shall not be required to be considered a payment on account unless such payment item is a wire
        transfer of immediately available funds made to the applicable Agent’s Account in the applicable Currency or unless and until such payment item is honored when presented for payment.  Should any payment item not be honored when presented for
        payment, then Borrowers shall be deemed not to have made such payment.  Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, any payment item shall be deemed received by Agent only if it is received into the applicable Agent’s Account on a
        Business Day on or before 1:30 p.m.  If any payment item is received into the applicable Agent’s Account on a non-Business Day or after 1:30 p.m. on a Business Day (unless Agent, in its sole discretion, elects to credit it on the date received), it
        shall be deemed to have been received by Agent as of the opening of business on the immediately following Business Day.
 
2.8          Designated Account.  Agent is authorized to make the Revolving Loans, and Issuing Bank is authorized to issue the Letters of Credit, under this Agreement
        based upon telephonic or other instructions received from anyone purporting to be an Authorized Person or, without instructions, if pursuant to Section 2.6(d).  Borrowers agree to establish and maintain
        each Designated Account with each Designated Account Bank for the purpose of receiving the proceeds of the Revolving Loans requested by Borrowers and made by Agent or the Lenders hereunder.  Unless otherwise agreed by Agent and Borrowers, any
        Revolving Loan or Swing Loan requested by Borrowers and made by Agent or the Lenders hereunder shall be made to the applicable Designated Account.
 
2.9         Maintenance of Loan Account; Statements of Obligations.  Agent shall maintain an account on its books in the name of Borrowers (the “Loan Account”) on which Borrowers will be charged with all Revolving Loans (including Extraordinary Advances and Swing Loans) made by Agent, Swing Lenders, or the Lenders to Borrowers or for Borrowers’ account, the Letters of
        Credit issued or arranged by Issuing Bank for Borrowers’ account, and with all other payment Obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, including, accrued interest, fees and expenses, and Lender Group Expenses.  In accordance with Section 2.7, the Loan Account will be credited with all payments received by Agent from Borrowers or for Borrowers’ account.  Agent shall make available to Borrowers monthly statements regarding the Loan
        Account, including the principal amount of the Revolving Loans, interest accrued hereunder, fees accrued or charged hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and a summary itemization of all charges and expenses constituting Lender Group
        Expenses accrued hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and each such statement, absent manifest error, shall be conclusively presumed to be correct and accurate and constitute an account stated between Borrowers and the Lender Group unless,
        within 30 days after Agent first makes such a statement available to Borrowers, Borrowers shall deliver to Agent written objection thereto describing the error or errors contained in such statement.

(c)        Field Examination and Other Fees.  Subject to any limitations set forth in Section 5.7(c), Borrowers shall pay to Agent, field examination, appraisal, and valuation fees and charges, as
          and when incurred or chargeable, as follows (i) a fee of $1,000 per day, per examiner, plus out-of-pocket expenses (including travel, meals, and
          lodging) for each field examination of any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries performed by or on behalf of Agent, and (ii) the fees, charges or expenses paid or incurred by Agent if it elects to employ the services of one or more third Persons to
          appraise the Collateral, or any portion thereof, or to assess any Loan Party’s or its Subsidiaries’ business valuation.
 
2.11        Letters of Credit.
 
(a)        Subject to the terms and conditions of this
          Agreement, upon the request of Borrowers made in accordance herewith, and prior to the Latest Maturity Date, (x) Issuing Bank agrees to issue, or to cause Canadian Underlying Issuer (as Issuing Bank’s agent) to issue, a requested standby Global
          Letter of Credit or a sight commercial Global Letter of Credit for the account of any Subsidiary of the Borrowers (provided that the Global Borrowers hereby irrevocably agree to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for amounts drawn on any
          Letters of Credit issued for the account of any Subsidiary of the Borrowers on a joint and several basis with such Subsidiary and shall be a co-applicant for each such Letter of Credit issued for the account of a Subsidiary) in Dollars or one or
          more Alternative Currencies and (y) Issuing Bank agrees to issue a requested standby German Letter of Credit or a sight commercial German Letter of Credit for the account of the German Borrower in Euros or Dollars; provided

          (y) no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue a sight commercial Letter of Credit. If Issuing Bank, at its option, elects to cause a Canadian Underlying Issuer to issue a requested Letter of Credit, then Issuing Bank agrees that it will enter
          into arrangements relative to the reimbursement of such Canadian Underlying Issuer (which may include, among other means, by becoming an applicant with respect to such Letter of Credit or entering into undertakings or other arrangements that
          provide for reimbursement of such Canadian Underlying Issuer with respect to drawings under such Letter of Credit; each such obligation or undertaking, irrespective of whether in writing, a “Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking”) with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Canadian Underlying Issuer. By submitting a request to Issuing Bank for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, Borrowers shall be
          deemed to have requested that Issuing Bank issue, or cause the issuance of, the requested Letter of Credit.  Each request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or the amendment or extension of any outstanding Letter of Credit, shall be (i)
          irrevocable and made in writing by an Authorized Person, (ii) delivered to Agent and Issuing Bank via telefacsimile or other electronic method of transmission reasonably acceptable to Agent and Issuing Bank and reasonably in advance of the
          requested date of issuance, amendment, or extension, and (iii) subject to Issuing Bank’s authentication procedures with results satisfactory to Issuing Bank.  Each such request shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent and
          Issuing Bank and (i) shall specify (A) the amount of such Letter of Credit, (B) the date of issuance, amendment, or extension of such Letter of Credit, (C) the proposed expiration date of such Letter of Credit, (D) the name and address of the

          Borrower) and (G) such other information (including, the conditions to drawing, and, in the case of an amendment or extension, identification of the Letter of Credit to be so amended or extended) as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, or extend
          such Letter of Credit, and (ii) shall be accompanied by such Issuer Documents as Agent or Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer may request or require, to the extent that such requests or requirements are consistent with the Issuer Documents
          that Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer generally requests for Letters of Credit in similar circumstances.  Issuing Bank’s records of the content of any such request will be conclusive.
 

-103-

 

(b)         Issuing Bank shall have no obligation to
          issue a Letter of Credit or to issue a Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking in respect of a Canadian Underlying Letter of Credit if any of the following would result after giving effect to the requested issuance:
 
(A)         the Dollar Equivalent of the Letter of
          Credit Usage would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, or
 
(B)         the Dollar Equivalent of the Letter of
          Credit Usage attributable to Letters of Credit issued by any Issuing Bank would exceed the amount set forth opposite such Issuing Bank’s name  on Schedule C-2, or
 
(C)       the Dollar Equivalent of the Letter of Credit
          Usage denominated in Sterling would exceed the UK Letter of Credit Sublimit, or
 
(D)       the Dollar Equivalent of the Letter of Credit
          Usage denominated in Canadian Dollars would exceed the Canadian Letter of Credit Sublimit, or
 
(E)         the Dollar Equivalent of the German Letter
          of Credit Usage would exceed the German Letter of Credit Sublimit, or
 
(F)         the Availability Conditions are not
          satisfied.
 
(c)          In the event there is a Defaulting Lender
          as of the date of any request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue or arrange for such Letter of Credit to the extent (i) the Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure with respect to such Letter
          of Credit may not be reallocated pursuant to Section 2.3(g)(ii), or (ii) Issuing Bank has not otherwise entered into arrangements reasonably satisfactory to it and Borrowers to eliminate Issuing Bank’s
          risk with respect to the participation in such Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking of the Defaulting Lender, which arrangements may include Borrowers cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure in
          accordance with Section 2.3(g)(ii).  Additionally, Issuing Bank shall have no obligation to issue or extend a Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking if (A) any order, judgment, or
          decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall, by its terms, purport to enjoin or restrain Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking, or any law applicable to Issuing Bank or any request or
          directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over Issuing Bank shall prohibit or request that Issuing Bank refrain from the issuance, or causing the issuance, of letters of credit generally
          or such Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking in particular, (B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking would violate one or more policies of Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer
          applicable to letters of credit generally, or (C) if amounts demanded to be paid under any Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking will not or may not be in Dollars or the applicable Alternative Currency.
 

-104-

 

(d)        Any Issuing Bank (other than Wells Fargo or
          any of its Affiliates) shall notify Agent in writing no later than the Business Day prior to the Business Day on which such Issuing Bank issues any Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking.  In addition, each Issuing Bank (other
          than Wells Fargo or any of its Affiliates) shall, on the first Business Day of each week, submit to Agent a report detailing the daily undrawn amount of each Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking issued by such Issuing Bank
          during the prior calendar week.  Each Letter of Credit shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Issuing Bank, including the requirement that the amounts payable thereunder must be payable in Dollars or an Alternative Currency.  If
          Issuing Bank makes a payment under a Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking, Borrowers shall pay to Agent an amount equal to the applicable Letter of Credit Disbursement on the Business Day such Letter of Credit Disbursement is
          made and, in the absence of such payment, the amount of the Letter of Credit Disbursement immediately and automatically shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder (notwithstanding any failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth in
          Section 3) made in the Currency in which such Letter of Credit was issued to the applicable Borrower acting as applicant for such Letter of Credit and, initially, shall bear interest at (i) for Letters
          of Credit denominated in Dollars or Canadian Dollars, the Base Rate then applicable to Revolving Loans, (ii) for Letters of Credit denominated in Euros, the Eurocurrency Rate then applicable to Revolving Loans for a one (1) month period, and
          (iii) for Letters of Credit denominated in any other  Alternative Currency (other than Canadian Dollars), the rate then applicable to Revolving Loans denominated in such Alternative Currency (other than Canadian Dollars).   If a Letter of Credit
          Disbursement is deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder, Borrowers’ obligation to pay the amount of such Letter of Credit Disbursement to Issuing Bank shall be automatically converted into an obligation to pay the resulting Revolving Loan. 
          Promptly following receipt by Agent of any payment from Borrowers pursuant to this paragraph, Agent shall distribute such payment to Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to Section 2.11(e) to reimburse Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.
 
(e)          Promptly following receipt of a notice of a
          Letter of Credit Disbursement pursuant to Section 2.11(d), each Revolving Lender agrees to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Revolving Loan deemed made pursuant to Section

              2.11(d) on the same terms and conditions as if Borrowers had requested the amount thereof as a Revolving Loan and Agent shall promptly pay to Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.  By the issuance
          of a Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking (or an amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking) and without any further action on the part of Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, Issuing
          Bank shall be deemed to have granted to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, a participation in each Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking issued by Issuing Bank, in an amount equal
          to its Pro Rata Share of such Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking, and each such Revolving Lender agrees to pay to Agent, for the account of Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of any Letter of Credit
          Disbursement made by Issuing Bank under the applicable Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to
          Agent in the applicable Currency, for the account of Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of each Letter of Credit Disbursement made by Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by Borrowers on the date due as provided in Section 2.11(d), or of any reimbursement payment that is required to be refunded (or that Agent or Issuing Bank elects, based upon the advice of counsel, to refund) to Borrowers for any reason.  Each
          Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to deliver to Agent, for the account of Issuing Bank, an amount in the applicable Currency equal to its respective Pro Rata Share of each Letter of Credit Disbursement pursuant to this
          Section 2.11(e) shall be absolute and unconditional and such remittance shall be made notwithstanding the occurrence or continuation of an Event of Default or Default or the failure to satisfy any
          condition set forth in Section 3.  If any such Revolving Lender fails to make available to Agent the amount of such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of a Letter of Credit Disbursement as provided in
          this Section, such Revolving Lender shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender and Agent (for the account of Issuing Bank) shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender together with interest thereon at the
          Defaulting Lender Rate until paid in full.

(f)          Each Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend
          and hold harmless each member of the Lender Group (including Issuing Bank and its branches, Affiliates, Applicable Designees, and correspondents) and each such Person’s respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents (each,
          including Issuing Bank and Canadian Underlying Issuer, a “Letter of Credit Related Person”) (to the fullest extent permitted by law) from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions,
          investigations, proceedings, liabilities, fines, costs, penalties, and damages, and all reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys, experts, or consultants and all other costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith or in connection
          with the enforcement of this indemnification (as and when they are incurred and irrespective of whether suit is brought), which may be incurred by or awarded against any Letter of Credit Related Person (other than Taxes, which shall be governed
          by Section 16) (the “Letter of Credit Indemnified Costs”), and which arise out of or in connection with, or as a result of this Agreement, any Letter of
          Credit, any Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking, any Issuer Document, or any Drawing Document referred to in or related to any Letter of Credit, or any action or proceeding arising out of any of the foregoing (whether administrative, judicial or
          in connection with arbitration); in each case, including that resulting from the Letter of Credit Related Person’s own negligence; provided, that such indemnity shall not be available to any Letter of
          Credit Related Person claiming indemnification to the extent that such Letter of Credit Indemnified Costs may be finally determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted directly from the gross
          negligence or willful misconduct of the Letter of Credit Related Person claiming indemnity.  This indemnification provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and all Letters of Credit.
 
(g)          The liability of Issuing Bank (or any other
          Letter of Credit Related Person) under, in connection with or arising out of any Letter of Credit (or pre-advice), regardless of the form or legal grounds of the action or proceeding, shall be limited to direct damages suffered by Borrowers that
          are caused directly by Issuing Bank’s or Canadian Underlying Issuer’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in (i) honoring a presentation under a Letter of Credit that on its face does not at least substantially comply with the terms and
          conditions of such Letter of Credit, (ii) failing to honor a presentation under a Letter of Credit that strictly complies with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, or (iii) retaining Drawing Documents presented under a Letter of
          Credit.  Borrowers’ aggregate remedies against Issuing Bank and any Letter of Credit Related Person for wrongfully honoring a presentation under any Letter of Credit or wrongfully retaining honored Drawing Documents shall in no event exceed the
          aggregate amount paid by Borrowers to Issuing Bank in respect of the honored presentation in connection with such Letter of Credit under Section 2.11(d), plus interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder (provided that, for purposes of the foregoing, any such amount denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than
          Canadian Dollars) shall be deemed to be an amount denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency) and shall bear interest at the Base Rate).  Borrowers shall take action to avoid and mitigate the
          amount of any damages claimed against Issuing Bank or any other Letter of Credit Related Person, including by enforcing its rights against the beneficiaries of the Letters of Credit.  Any claim by Borrowers under or in connection with any Letter
          of Credit shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum of (x) the amount (if any) saved by Borrowers as a result of the breach or alleged wrongful conduct complained of, and (y) the amount (if any) of the loss that would have been avoided had
          Borrowers taken all reasonable steps to mitigate any loss, and in case of a claim of wrongful dishonor, by specifically and timely authorizing Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer to effect a cure.

(h)          Borrowers are responsible for the final
          text of the Letter of Credit as issued by Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer, irrespective of any assistance Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer may provide such as drafting or recommending text or by Issuing Bank’s or Canadian
          Underlying Issuer’s use or refusal to use text submitted by Borrowers. Borrowers understand that the final form of any Letter of Credit may be subject to such revisions and changes as are deemed necessary or appropriate by Issuing Bank or
          Canadian Underlying Issuer, and Borrowers hereby consent to such revisions and changes not materially different from the application executed in connection therewith. Borrowers are solely responsible for the suitability of the Letter of Credit
          for Borrowers’ purposes.  If Borrowers request Issuing Bank to issue, or cause the issuance of a Letter of Credit for an affiliated or unaffiliated third party (an “Account Party”), (i) such Account
          Party shall have no rights against Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer; (ii) Borrowers shall be responsible for the application and obligations under this Agreement; and (iii) communications (including notices) related to the respective
          Letter of Credit shall be among Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer (if applicable) and Borrowers.  Borrowers will examine the copy of the Letter of Credit and any other documents sent by Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer in
          connection therewith and shall promptly notify Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer, as applicable (not later than three (3) Business Days following Borrowers’ receipt of documents from Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer) of any
          non-compliance with Borrowers’ instructions and of any discrepancy in any document under any presentment or other irregularity.  Borrowers understand and agree that Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer is not required to extend the
          expiration date of any Letter of Credit for any reason. With respect to any Letter of Credit containing an “automatic amendment” to extend the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer, as applicable, in
          its sole and absolute discretion, may give notice of non-extension of such Letter of Credit and, if Borrowers do not at any time want the then current expiration date of such Letter of Credit to be extended, Borrowers will so notify Agent and
          Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer, as applicable, at least 30 calendar days before Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer, as applicable, is required to notify the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any advising bank of such
          non-extension pursuant to the terms of such Letter of Credit.
 
(i)          Borrowers’ reimbursement and payment
          obligations under this Section 2.11 are absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
          whatsoever; provided, that subject to Section 2.11(g) above, the foregoing shall not release Issuing Bank from such liability to Borrowers as may be finally
          determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction against Issuing Bank following reimbursement or payment of the obligations and liabilities, including reimbursement and other payment obligations, of Borrowers to
          Issuing Bank arising under, or in connection with, this Section 2.11 or any Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking.
 
(j)          Without limiting any other provision of
          this Agreement, Issuing Bank and each other Letter of Credit Related Person (if applicable) shall not be responsible to Borrowers for, and Issuing Bank’s rights and remedies against Borrowers and the obligation of Borrowers to reimburse Issuing
          Bank for each drawing under each Letter of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking with respect to such drawing shall not be impaired by:
 

-107-

 

(i)          honor of a presentation under any Letter of
          Credit that on its face substantially complies with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, even if the Letter of Credit requires strict compliance by the beneficiary;
 
(ii)         honor of a presentation of any Drawing
          Document that appears on its face to have been signed, presented or issued (A) by any purported successor or transferee of any beneficiary or other Person required to sign, present or issue such Drawing Document or (B) under a new name of the
          beneficiary;
 
(iii)        acceptance as a draft of any written or
          electronic demand or request for payment under a Letter of Credit, even if nonnegotiable or not in the form of a draft or notwithstanding any requirement that such draft, demand or request bear any or adequate reference to the Letter of Credit;
 
(iv)        the identity or authority of any presenter
          or signer of any Drawing Document or the form, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any Drawing Document (other than Issuing Bank’s or Canadian Underlying Issuer’s determination that such Drawing Document appears on its face substantially to
          comply with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit);
 
(v)       acting upon any instruction or request
          relative to a Letter of Credit or requested Letter of Credit that Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer in good faith believes to have been given by a Person authorized to give such instruction or request;
 
(vi)        any errors, omissions, interruptions or
          delays in transmission or delivery of any message, advice or document (regardless of how sent or transmitted) or for errors in interpretation of technical terms or in translation or any delay in giving or failing to give notice to any Borrower;
 
(vii)        any acts, omissions or fraud by, or the
          insolvency of, any beneficiary, any nominated person or entity or any other Person or any breach of contract between any beneficiary and any Borrower or any of the parties to the underlying transaction to which the Letter of Credit relates;
 
(viii)      assertion or waiver of any provision of the
          ISP or UCP that primarily benefits an issuer of a letter of credit, including any requirement that any Drawing Document be presented to it at a particular hour or place;
 
(ix)       payment to any presenting bank (designated
          or permitted by the terms of the applicable Letter of Credit) claiming that it rightfully honored or is entitled to reimbursement or indemnity under Standard Letter of Credit Practice applicable to it;
 
(x)          acting or failing to act as required or
          permitted under Standard Letter of Credit Practice applicable to where Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer has issued, confirmed, advised or negotiated such Letter of Credit, as the case may be;
 

-108-

 

(xi)       honor of a presentation after the expiration
          date of any Letter of Credit notwithstanding that a presentation was made prior to such expiration date and dishonored by Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer if subsequently Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer or any court or other
          finder of fact determines such presentation should have been honored;
 
(xii)        dishonor of any presentation that does not
          strictly comply or that is fraudulent, forged or otherwise not entitled to honor; or
 
(xiii)      honor of a presentation that is
          subsequently determined by Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer to have been made in violation of international, federal, state, provincial or local restrictions on the transaction of business with certain prohibited Persons.
 
(k)         Borrowers shall pay immediately upon demand
          directly to Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer as non-refundable fees, commissions, and charges (it being acknowledged and agreed that any charging of such fees, commissions, and charges to the Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.6(d) shall be deemed to constitute a demand for payment thereof for the purposes of this Section 2.11(k)):  (i) a fronting fee, which shall be imposed
          by Issuing Bank equal to 0.125% per annum times the average amount of the Dollar Equivalent of the Letter of Credit Usage during the immediately
          preceding quarter (or if an Event of Default has occurred, month) (or portion thereof), plus (ii) the Dollar Equivalent of any and all other customary commissions, fees and charges
          then in effect imposed by, and any and all expenses incurred by, Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer, or by any adviser, confirming institution or entity or other nominated person, relating to Letters of Credit, at the time of issuance of
          any Letter of Credit and upon the occurrence of any other activity with respect to any Letter of Credit (including transfers, assignments of proceeds, amendments, drawings, extensions or cancellations). Borrowers shall also pay directly to
          Canadian Underlying Issuer all of its fees, commissions and charges in respect of Letters of Credit issued by such Canadian Underlying Issuer upon written demand.
 
(l)          If by reason of (x) any Change in Law, or
          (y) compliance by Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or any other member of the Lender Group with any direction, request, or requirement (irrespective of whether having the force of law) of any Governmental Authority or monetary authority
          including, Regulation D of the Board of Governors as from time to time in effect (and any successor thereto):
 
(i)          any reserve, deposit, or similar
          requirement is or shall be imposed or modified in respect of any Letter of Credit issued or caused to be issued hereunder or hereby, or any Loans or obligations to make Loans hereunder or hereby, or
 
(ii)        there shall be imposed on Issuing Bank,
          Canadian Underlying Issuer or any other member of the Lender Group any other condition regarding any Letter of Credit, Loans, or obligations to make Loans hereunder,
 
and the result of the foregoing is to increase, directly or indirectly, the cost to Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or any other member of the Lender Group of
      issuing, making, participating in, or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount receivable in respect thereof, then, and in any such case, Agent may, at any time within a reasonable period after the additional cost is incurred or the
      amount received is reduced, notify Borrowers, and Borrowers shall pay within 30 days after demand therefor, such amounts as Agent may specify to be necessary to compensate Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or any other member of the Lender
      Group for such additional cost or reduced receipt, together with interest on such amount from the date of such demand until payment in full thereof at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder (provided that, for purposes of the
      foregoing, any such amount denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than Canadian Dollars) shall be deemed to be an amount denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency) and shall bear interest
      at the U.S. Base Rate); provided, that (A) Borrowers shall not be required to provide any compensation pursuant to this Section 2.11(l) for any such amounts
      incurred more than 180 days prior to the date on which the demand for payment of such amounts is first made to Borrowers, and (B) if an event or circumstance giving rise to such amounts is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall
      be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.  The determination by Agent of any amount due pursuant to this Section 2.11(l), as set forth in a certificate setting forth the calculation
      thereof in reasonable detail, shall, in the absence of manifest or demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto.
 

-109-

 

(m)        Each standby Letter of Credit shall expire
          not later than the date that is 12 months after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit; provided, that any standby Letter of Credit may provide for the automatic extension thereof for any
          number of additional periods each of up to one year in duration; provided further, that with respect to any Letter of Credit which extends beyond the Latest
          Maturity Date, Letter of Credit Collateralization shall be provided therefor on or before the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.  Each commercial Letter of Credit shall expire on the earlier of (i)

          120 days after the date of the issuance of such commercial Letter of Credit and (ii) five Business Days prior to the Latest Maturity Date.
 
(n)        If (i) any
          Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, or (ii) Availability shall at any time be less than zero, then on the Business Day following the date when Administrative Borrower receives notice from Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the
          maturity of the Obligations has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with Letter of Credit Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total Letter Credit Exposure) demanding Letter of Credit Collateralization pursuant to this Section 2.11(n) upon such demand, Borrowers shall provide Letter of Credit Collateralization with respect to the then existing Letter of Credit Usage..
 
(o)         Unless otherwise expressly agreed by
          Issuing Bank (or Canadian Underlying Issuer, if applicable) and Borrowers when a Letter of Credit is issued, (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the UCP shall apply to each commercial
          Letter of Credit.
 
(p)         Issuing Bank and Canadian Underlying Issuer
          shall be deemed to have acted with due diligence and reasonable care if Issuing Bank’s or Canadian Underlying Issuer’s conduct is in accordance with Standard Letter of Credit Practice or in accordance with this Agreement.
 
(q)         In the event of a direct conflict between
          the provisions of this Section 2.11 and any provision contained in any Issuer Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and construed, to the fullest
          extent possible, to be in concert with each other.  In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this Section 2.11 shall control
          and govern.
 
(r)          The provisions of this Section 2.11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment in full of the Obligations with respect to any Letters of Credit or Canadian Reimbursement Undertaking that remain outstanding.
 

-110-

 



(s)          At Borrowers’ costs and expense, Borrowers shall execute and deliver to Issuing Bank such additional certificates, instruments and/or documents and take such additional action as may be reasonably
          requested by Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer to enable Issuing Bank or Canadian Underlying Issuer to issue any Letter of Credit pursuant to this Agreement and related Issuer Document, to protect, exercise and/or enforce Issuing Banks’
          rights and interests under this Agreement or to give effect to the terms and provisions of this Agreement or any Issuer Document.  Each Borrower irrevocably appoints Issuing Bank as its attorney-in-fact and authorizes Issuing Bank, without notice
          to Borrowers, to execute and deliver ancillary documents and letters customary in the letter of credit business that may include but are not limited to advisements, indemnities, checks, bills of exchange and issuance documents.  The power of
          attorney granted by Borrowers is limited solely to such actions related to the issuance, confirmation or amendment of any Letter of Credit and to ancillary documents or letters customary in the letter of credit business.  This appointment is
          coupled with an interest.

 
2.12        Eurocurrency Rate Option and RFR Option.
 
(a)         Interest and Interest Payment Dates.  Borrowers shall have the option, subject to Section 2.12(b) to have interest on all or a
            portion of the Revolving Loans be charged (whether at the time when made (unless otherwise provided herein), upon conversion from a Base Rate Loan to an applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loan or RFR Loan for such Currency, or upon continuation of a
            Eurocurrency Rate Loan or RFR Loan, as a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or RFR Loan, as applicable, for such Currency) at a rate of interest based upon the applicable Eurocurrency Rate or RFR, for such Currency (in the case of the Eurocurrency Rate,
            the “Eurocurrency Rate Option” and in the case of an RFR, the “RFR Option”).  Interest on the Loans shall be payable on the Interest Payment Date therefor or, if earlier, (i) the date on which all or any portion of the Obligations
            are accelerated pursuant to the terms hereof or (ii) the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof..  With respect to a Daily Simple RFR Loan, on the Interest Payment Date therefor, unless Borrowers have properly
            exercised the RFR Option with respect thereto, such Daily Simple RFR Loan shall automatically be converted into Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the applicable Alternative Currency).  With
            respect to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a SOFR Rate Loan, on the last day of each applicable Interest Period, unless Borrowers have properly exercised the Eurocurrency Rate Option or RFR Option with respect thereto, the interest rate applicable
            to such Loan automatically shall convert to the rate of interest then applicable to Base Rate Loans of the same type hereunder; provided that any outstanding affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency (other
            than Canadian Dollars), shall be converted into Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency) upon expiration of the applicable Interest Period.
 
(b)          Eurocurrency Rate and RFR Election.
 
(i)          Borrowers may, at any time and from time to time, so long as Borrowers have not received a notice from Agent (which notice Agent may elect to give or not give in its discretion
            unless Agent is directed to give such notice by the Required Lenders, in which case, it shall give the notice to Borrowers), after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to terminate the right of Borrowers to exercise
            the Eurocurrency Rate Option or RFR Option during the continuance of such Event of Default, elect to exercise the Eurocurrency Rate Option or RFR Option by notifying Agent prior to 11:00 a.m. as follows: (A) with respect to an RFR Option
            electing a Daily Simple RFR at least five (5) RFR Business Days prior to the requested Funding Date or continuation (the “Daily Simple RFR Deadline”), (B) with respect to an RFR Option electing Term SOFR at least three (3) RFR Business
            Days prior to the commencement of the requested Interest Period (the “Term SOFR Deadline”), and (C) with respect to an Eurocurrency Rate Option electing a Eurocurrency Rate at least three (3) Eurocurrency Banking Days prior to the
            commencement of the requested Interest Period (the “Eurocurrency Deadline”).  Notice of Borrowers’ election of the Eurocurrency Rate Option or RFR Option for a permitted portion of the Revolving Loans and (if applicable) an Interest
            Period pursuant to this Section shall be made by delivery to Agent of a Eurocurrency Rate Notice or RFR Notice, as applicable, received by Agent before the Eurocurrency Deadline, Daily Simple RFR Deadline or Term SOFR Deadline, as applicable. 
            Promptly upon its receipt of each such Eurocurrency Rate Notice or RFR Notice, as applicable, Agent shall provide notice thereof to each of the affected Lenders.  In the event, if Borrowers no longer have the option to request Eurocurrency
            Loans or RFR Loans then any outstanding affected RFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, in each case denominated in Dollars or Canadian Dollars will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest
            Period, and any outstanding affected Daily Simple RFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, in each case, denominated in an Alternative Currency, will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal
            to the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency) immediately or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, at the end of the applicable Interest Period.  If the Borrowers request a conversion to, or continuation of, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan
            or a SOFR Rate Loan, but fail to specify an Interest Period, they will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.



-111-

 

 (ii)        Each Eurocurrency Rate Notice and RFR Notice shall be irrevocable and binding on Borrowers.  In connection with each Eurocurrency Rate Loan and RFR Loan, each Borrower shall
            indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and the Lenders harmless against any loss, cost or expense (including any loss, cost or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds or from any fees payable, but excluding loss of anticipated
            profits) incurred by Agent or any Lender as a consequence of (A) the payment or required assignment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or SOFR Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto or Daily
            Simple RFR Loan other than on the Interest Payment Date therefor (including as a result of an Event of Default), (B) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or SOFR Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
            thereto or any Daily Simple RFR Loan other than on the Interest Payment Date therefor (including as a result of an Event of Default), or (C) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or RFR Loan on the date
            specified in any Eurocurrency Rate Notice or RFR Notice delivered pursuant hereto (such losses, costs, or expenses, “Funding Losses”).  A certificate of Agent or a Lender delivered to Borrowers setting forth in reasonable detail any
            amount or amounts that Agent or such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Borrowers shall pay such amount to Agent or the Lender, as applicable, within 30 days of the
            date of its receipt of such certificate.  If a payment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or SOFR Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period or a Daily Simple RFR Loan on a day other than the Interest Payment Date
            therefor would result in a Funding Loss, Agent may, in its sole discretion at the request of Borrowers, hold the amount of such payment as cash collateral in support of the Obligations until the last day of such Interest Period or until such
            Interest Payment Date, as applicable, and apply such amounts to the payment of the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loan or RFR Loan on such day, it being agreed that Agent has no obligation to so defer the application of payments to any
            Eurocurrency Rate Loan or RFR Loan and that, in the event that Agent does not defer such application, Borrowers shall be obligated to pay any resulting Funding Losses.
 
 (iii)      Unless Agent, in its sole discretion, agrees otherwise, Borrowers shall have not more than five Eurocurrency Rate Loans, and five RFR Loans in effect at any given time.  Borrowers
            may only exercise the Eurocurrency Option for proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loans of at least $1,000,000 and the RFR Option for proposed RFR Loans of at least $1,000,000.

(c)        Conversion; Prepayment.  Borrowers may (i) convert RFR Loans denominated in Dollars and Eurocurrency
            Rate Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars to Base Rate Loans, or (ii) prepay Eurocurrency Loans or RFR Loans at any time; provided, that in the event that any Eurocurrency Rate Loan, or RFR Loans, are converted or prepaid on any date
            that is not the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, including as a result of any prepayment through the required application by Agent of any payments or proceeds of Collateral in accordance with Section 2.4(b) or for any
            other reason, including early termination of the term of this Agreement or acceleration of all or any portion of the Obligations pursuant to the terms hereof, each Borrower shall indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and the Lenders and their
            Participants harmless against any and all Funding Losses in accordance with Section 2.12 (b)(ii).
 
(d)          Special Provisions Applicable to Eurocurrency and RFR.
 
(i)         The applicable Eurocurrency Rate, Term SOFR or the applicable Daily Simple RFR may be adjusted by Agent with respect to any Lender on a prospective basis to take into account any
            additional or increased costs or, with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate, Term SOFR or any Daily Simple RFR, increased costs to such Lender of maintaining or obtaining any deposits in any Currency or increased costs (other than Taxes which shall
            be governed by Section 16), in each case, due to changes in applicable law occurring subsequent to the commencement of the then applicable Interest Period (or in the case of any Daily Simple RFR, occurring subsequent to the Funding Date
            for the applicable Daily Simple RFR Loan), including any Changes in Law and changes in the reserve requirements imposed by the Board of Governors, which additional or increased costs would increase the cost of funding or maintaining loans
            bearing interest at the applicable Eurocurrency Rate, Term SOFR or the applicable Daily Simple RFR.  In any such event, the affected Lender shall give Borrowers and Agent notice of such a determination and adjustment and Agent promptly shall
            transmit the notice to each other Lender and, upon its receipt of the notice from the affected Lender, Borrowers may, by notice to such affected Lender (A) require such Lender to furnish to Borrowers a statement setting forth in reasonable
            detail the basis for adjusting such applicable Eurocurrency Rate, Term SOFR or the applicable Daily Simple RFR and the method for determining the amount of such adjustment, or (B) repay the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Loans of
            such Lender with respect to which such adjustment is made (together with any amounts due under Section 2.12(b)(ii)).
 

-113-

 

(ii)        Subject to the provisions set forth in Section 2.12(d)(iii) below, in connection with any RFR Loan or any Eurocurrency Rate Loan, a request therefor, a conversion to or a
            continuation thereof or otherwise, if for any reason Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that (A)(x) if Daily Simple RFR is utilized in any calculations hereunder or under any other
            Loan Document with respect to any Obligations, interest, fees, commissions or other amounts, reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining Daily Simple RFR pursuant to the definition thereof or (y) if Term SOFR or a Eurocurrency
            Rate is utilized in any calculations hereunder or under any other Loan Document with respect to any Obligations, interest, fees, commissions or other amounts, reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining Term SOFR or such
            Eurocurrency Rate, as applicable, for the applicable Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Rate Loan or such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, as applicable, on or prior to the first day of such Interest Period, (B) a fundamental change has
            occurred in foreign exchange or interbank markets with respect to the applicable Currency (including changes in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls), (C) with
            respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Loan, deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for the applicable Currency or (D) any Change in Law any time after the date hereof, in the reasonable opinion of any
            Lender, makes it unlawful or impractical for such Lender to fund or maintain any applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans or any RFR Loans or to continue such funding or maintaining, or to determine or charge interest rates at the applicable
            Eurocurrency Rate, Term SOFR or the applicable Daily Simple RFR, as applicable), and, in the case clause (D), such Lender has provided notice of such determination to Agent, Agent shall promptly give notice to Administrative Borrower.  Upon
            notice thereof by Agent to Administrative Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make RFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as applicable, in each such Currency, and any right of the Borrowers to convert any Loan in each such Currency (if
            applicable) to or continue any Loan as an RFR Loan or Eurocurrency Rate Loan, as applicable, in each such Currency, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected RFR Loans or, in the case of SOFR Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the
            affected Interest Periods) until Agent (with respect to clause (D), at the instruction of all affected Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, (I) the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion
            to or continuation of RFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans in each such affected Currency (to the extent of the affected RFR Loans or, in the case of SOFR Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the affected Interest Periods) or, failing that,
            (1) in the case of any request for a borrowing of an affected SOFR Rate Loan or Eurocurrency Rate Loan denominated in Canadian Dollars, the Borrowers will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or
            conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (2) in the case of any request for a borrowing of an affected RFR Loan or Eurocurrency Rate Loan in an Alternative Currency, then such request shall be ineffective and (II)(1)
            any outstanding affected SOFR Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loan denominated in Canadian Dollars will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period (or immediately if it is unlawful for any
            such Loan to be outstanding until such time) and (2) any outstanding affected RFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than Canadian Dollars), at the Borrowers’ election, shall either (x) be converted
            into Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency) immediately or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, at the end of the applicable Interest Period (or immediately if it is
            unlawful for any such Loan to be outstanding until such time) or (y) be prepaid in full immediately or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, at the end of the applicable Interest Period  (or immediately if it is unlawful for any such Loan to
            be outstanding until such time); provided that if no election is made by the Borrowers by the date that is three (3) Business Days after receipt by Administrative Borrower of such notice, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have elected
            clause (x) above.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest (except with respect to any prepayment or conversion of a Daily Simple RFR Loan) on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any
            additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.12(b)(ii).
 
(iii)         Benchmark Replacement Setting.
 
(A)       Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, with respect to any
            Benchmark, Agent shall provide written notice to the Lenders thereof and Agent and Administrative Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace such Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark
            Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and Administrative Borrower so long as Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of
            objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.  No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 2.12(d)(iii) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start
            Date.
 

-114-

 

(B)        Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, Agent will have the right to make
            Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any
            other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
 
(C)         Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. Agent will promptly notify Administrative Borrower and the Lenders of (1) the implementation of any Benchmark
            Replacement and (2) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement Agent will promptly notify Administrative Borrower of the removal or reinstatement
            of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.12(d)(iii)(D).  Any determination, decision or election that may be made by Agent or, if applicable any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.12(d)(iii) including any
            determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding
            absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.12(d)(iii).
 
(D)        Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the
            implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (1) if any then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate, EURIBOR or CDOR) and either (I) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information
            service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by Agent in its reasonable discretion or (II) the administrator of such Benchmark or the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public
            statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative or in compliance with or aligned with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for
            Financial Benchmarks, then Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable,  non-representative, non-compliant or
            non-aligned tenor and (2) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (1) above either (I) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (II) is not, or is no longer,
            subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative or in compliance with or aligned with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks for a Benchmark (including a
            Benchmark Replacement), then Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
 

-115-

 

(E)        Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon Administrative Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a given Benchmark,
            (I) the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of RFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, in each case, to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period denominated
            in the applicable Currency and, failing that, (1) in the case of any request for any affected SOFR Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, if applicable, Borrowers will be deemed to have converted any such request
            into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (2) in the case of any request for any affected RFR Loan or Eurocurrency Rate Loan, in each case, in an Alternative Currency (other than
            Canadian Dollars), if applicable, then such request shall be ineffective and (II)(1) any outstanding affected SOFR Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, if applicable, will be deemed to have been converted into
            Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period and (2) any outstanding affected RFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, in each case, denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than Canadian Dollars), at the Borrowers’ election,
            shall either (x) be converted into Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency) immediately or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, at the end of the applicable Interest
            Period or (y) be prepaid in full immediately or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, at the end of the applicable Interest Period; provided that, with respect to any Daily Simple RFR Loan, if no election is made by the Borrowers by
            the date that is three (3) Business Days after receipt by Administrative Borrower of such notice, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have elected clause (x) above; provided, further that, with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Loan,
            if no election is made by the Borrowers by the earlier of (AA) the date that is three (3) Business Days after receipt by Administrative Borrower of such notice and (BB) the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable Eurocurrency
            Rate Loan, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected clause (x) above.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest (except with respect to any prepayment or conversion of a Daily Simple RFR Loan) on
            the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.12(b)(ii).  During a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to any Benchmark or at any time that a tenor for any then-current
            Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark that is the subject of such Benchmark Unavailability Period or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any
            determination of Base Rate.
 
(F)        No Requirement of Matched Funding.  Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither
            Agent, nor any Lender, nor any of their Participants, is required actually to acquire deposits in the applicable Currency to fund or otherwise match fund any Obligation as to which interest accrues at the applicable Eurocurrency Rate, Term SOFR
            or the applicable Daily Simple RFR.
 
(G)       Alternative Currencies.  If, after the designation by the Lenders of any currency as an Alternative Currency, any change in currency controls
            or exchange regulations or any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions are imposed in the country in which such currency is issued, and such change results in, in the reasonable opinion of Agent (i) such
            currency no longer being readily available, freely transferable and convertible into Dollars, (ii) a Dollar Equivalent no longer being readily calculable with respect to such currency, (iii) such currency being impracticable for the Lenders to
            loan or (iv) such currency no longer being a currency in which the Required Lenders are willing to make Revolving Loans (each of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), a “Disqualifying Event”), then Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders
            and Borrowers, and such currency shall no longer be an Alternative Currency until such time as the Disqualifying Event(s) no longer exist.  Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice from Agent, Borrowers shall repay all Loans
            denominated in such currency to which the Disqualifying Event(s) apply or convert such Loans into the Dollar Equivalent in Dollars, bearing interest at the U.S. Base Rate, subject to the other terms contained herein.
 

-116-

 

(H)        Interest Act (Canada).  For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), (i) whenever a rate of interest or fee rate hereunder is calculated on
            the basis of a year (the “deemed year”) that contains fewer days than the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation, such rate of interest or fee rate shall be expressed as a yearly rate by multiplying such rate of interest or
            fee rate by the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation and dividing it by the number of days in the deemed year, (ii) the principle of deemed reinvestment of interest shall not apply to any interest calculation hereunder and
            (iii) the rates of interest stipulated herein are intended to be nominal rates and not effective rates or yields.
 
2.13       Capital Requirements.
 
(a)        If, after the date hereof, Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or any Lender determines that (i) any Change in Law regarding capital, liquidity or reserve requirements for banks
            or bank holding companies, or (ii) compliance by Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or such Lender, or their respective parent bank holding companies, with any guideline, request or directive of any Governmental Authority regarding
            capital adequacy or liquidity requirements (whether or not having the force of law), has the effect of reducing the return on Issuing Bank’s, Canadian Underlying Issuer’s, such Lender’s, or such holding companies’ capital or liquidity as a
            consequence of Issuing Bank’s, Canadian Underlying Issuer’s or such Lender’s commitments, Loans, participations or other obligations hereunder to a level below that which Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer, such Lender, or such holding
            companies could have achieved but for such Change in Law or compliance (taking into consideration Issuing Bank’s, Canadian Underlying Issuer’s, such Lender’s, or such holding companies’ then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy or
            liquidity requirements and assuming the full utilization of such entity’s capital) by any amount deemed by Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or such Lender to be material, then Issuing Bank or such Lender may notify Borrowers and Agent
            thereof.  Following receipt of such notice, Borrowers agree to pay Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or such Lender on demand the amount of such reduction of return of capital as and when such reduction is determined, payable within 30
            days after presentation by Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or such Lender of a statement in the amount and setting forth in reasonable detail Issuing Bank’s, Canadian Underlying Issuer’s or such Lender’s calculation thereof and the
            assumptions upon which such calculation was based (which statement shall be deemed true and correct absent manifest error).  In determining such amount, Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging
            and attribution methods.  Failure or delay on the part of Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of Issuing Bank’s, Canadian Underlying Issuer’s or
            such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided, that Borrowers shall not be required to compensate Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or a Lender pursuant to this Section for any reductions in return incurred more than
            180 days prior to the date that Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or such Lender notifies Borrowers of such Change in Law giving rise to such reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further,
            that if such claim arises by reason of the Change in Law that is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
 

-117-

 

(b)        If Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or any Lender requests additional or increased costs referred to in Section 2.11(l) or Section 2.12(d)(i) or amounts under
            Section 2.13(a) or sends a notice under Section 2.12(d)(ii) relative to changed circumstances (such Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or Lender, an “Affected Lender”), then, at the request of Administrative
            Borrower, such Affected Lender shall use reasonable efforts to promptly designate a different one of its lending offices or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices or branches, if (i) in the reasonable judgment
            of such Affected Lender, such designation or assignment would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.11(l), Section 2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a), as applicable, or would eliminate the illegality or
            impracticality of funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Loans (or any Base Rate Loans determined with reference to the applicable CDOR), and (ii) in the reasonable judgment of such Affected Lender, such designation or assignment
            would not subject it to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to it.  Borrowers agree to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by such Affected Lender in
            connection with any such designation or assignment.  If, after such reasonable efforts, such Affected Lender does not so designate a different one of its lending offices or assign its rights to another of its offices or branches so as to
            eliminate Borrowers’ obligation to pay any future amounts to such Affected Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(l), Section 2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a), as applicable, or to enable Borrowers to obtain the applicable
            Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Loans (or Base Rate Loans determined with reference to the applicable Daily Simple RFR), then Borrowers (without prejudice to any amounts then due to such Affected Lender under Section 2.11(l), Section
              2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a), as applicable) may, unless prior to the effective date of any such assignment the Affected Lender withdraws its request for such additional amounts under Section 2.11(l), Section
              2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a), as applicable, or indicates that it is no longer unlawful or impractical to fund or maintain the applicable Eurocurrency Loans or RFR Loans, may designate a different Issuing Bank or substitute a
            Lender or prospective Lender, in each case, reasonably acceptable to Agent (and, to the extent not an existing Lender, to the Issuing Banks) to purchase the Obligations owed to such Affected Lender and such Affected Lender’s commitments
            hereunder (a “Replacement Lender”), and if such Replacement Lender agrees to such purchase, such Affected Lender shall assign to the Replacement Lender its Obligations and commitments, and upon such purchase by the Replacement Lender,
            which such Replacement Lender shall be deemed to be “Issuing Bank”, “Underlying Canadian Issuer” or a “Lender” (as the case may be) for purposes of this Agreement and such Affected Lender shall cease to be “Issuing Bank”, “Underlying Canadian
            Issuer” or a “Lender” (as the case may be) for purposes of this Agreement.
 
(c)          Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the protection of Sections 2.11(l), 2.12(d), and 2.13 shall be available to Issuing Bank, Canadian
            Underlying Issuer and each Lender (as applicable) regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, judicial ruling, judgment, guideline, treaty or other change or condition which shall
            have occurred or been imposed, so long as it shall be customary for issuing banks or lenders affected thereby to comply therewith.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, neither Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer nor any Lender
            shall demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.13 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of Issuing Bank, Canadian Underlying Issuer or such Lender (as the case may be) to demand such compensation in similar
            circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements, if any.
 
2.14        Incremental Facilities.
 
(a)          At any time during the period from and after the Closing Date, at the option of Borrowers (but subject to the conditions set forth in clause (b) below), the Global Revolver
            Commitments may be increased by an amount in the aggregate for all such increases of the Global Revolver Commitments not to exceed Available Revolver Increase Amount (each such increase, an “Increase”); provided, that in no event
            shall the Global Revolver Commitments be increased by an amount in excess of the Available Revolver Increase Amount.  Agent shall invite each Lender to increase its Global Revolver Commitments (it being understood that no Lender shall be
            obligated to increase its Global Revolver Commitments) in connection with a proposed Increase at the interest margin proposed by Borrowers, and if sufficient Lenders do not agree to increase their Global Revolver Commitments in connection with
            such proposed Increase, then Agent or Borrowers may invite any prospective lender who is reasonably satisfactory to Agent, the Issuing Banks and Borrowers to become a Lender in connection with a proposed Increase.  Any Increase shall be in an
            amount of at least $25,000,0000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  In no event may the Global Revolver Commitments be increased pursuant to this Section 2.14 on more than four (4) occasions in the aggregate for all
            such Increases.
 

-118-

 

(b)          Each of the following shall be conditions precedent to any Increase of the Global Revolver Commitments:
 
(i)         Agent or Borrowers have obtained the commitment of one or more Lenders (or other prospective lenders) reasonably satisfactory to Agent, the Issuing Banks and Borrowers to provide the
            applicable Increase and any such Lenders (or prospective lenders), Borrowers, and Agent have signed a joinder agreement to this Agreement (an “Increase Joinder”), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent, to which such
            Lenders (or prospective lenders), Borrowers, and Agent are party,
 
(ii)           each of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.2 are satisfied,
 
(iii)        in connection with any Increase, if any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries owns or will acquire any Margin Stock, Borrowers shall deliver to Agent an updated Form U-1 (with
            sufficient additional originals thereof for each Lender), duly executed and delivered by Borrowers, together with such other documentation as Agent shall reasonably request, in order to enable Agent and the Lenders to comply with any of the
            requirements under Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors,
 
(iv)        Borrowers have delivered to Agent updated pro forma Projections (after giving effect to the applicable Increase) for the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries evidencing compliance on
            a pro forma basis with Section 7 for the twelve months (on a month-by-month basis) immediately following the proposed date of the applicable Increase (calculated as if a Covenant Testing Period was in effect during the entire twelve
            month period), and
 
(v)         the interest rate margins with respect to the Revolving Loans to be made pursuant to the increased Global Revolver Commitments shall be the same as the interest rate margin
            applicable to Global Revolving Loans hereunder immediately prior to the applicable Increase Date (as defined below).
 
(c)        Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all references in this Agreement and any other Loan Document to Revolving Loans shall be deemed, unless the context otherwise requires,
            to include Revolving Loans made pursuant to the increased Global Revolver Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.14.
 
(d)          Each of the Lenders having a Global Revolver Commitment prior to the Increase Date (the “Pre-Increase Revolver Lenders”) shall assign to any Lender which is acquiring a new or additional Global Revolver Commitment on the Increase Date (the “Post-Increase Revolver Lenders”), and such Post-Increase Revolver Lenders
            shall purchase from each Pre-Increase Revolver Lender, at the principal amount thereof, such interests in the Global Revolving Loans and participation interests in Global Letters of Credit on such Increase Date as shall be necessary in order
            that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, such Global Revolving Loans and participation interests in Global Letters of Credit will be held by Pre-Increase Revolver Lenders and Post-Increase Revolver Lenders ratably in
            accordance with their Pro Rata Share after giving effect to such increased Global Revolver Commitments.
 
(e)        The Global Revolving Loans and Global Revolver Commitments established pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall constitute Revolving Loans, Revolver Commitments, and Maximum
            Revolver Amount under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from any guarantees and the security interests
            created by the Loan Documents.  Borrowers shall take any actions reasonably required by Agent to ensure and demonstrate that the Liens and security interests granted by the Loan Documents continue to be perfected under the Code or the PPSA, as
            applicable, otherwise after giving effect to the establishment of any such new Global Revolver Commitments.

2.15       Joint and Several Liability of Certain Borrowers.
 
(a)          Each of the U.S. Borrowers, the UK Borrower and the Canadian Borrower is accepting joint and several liability hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in consideration of the
            financial accommodations to be provided by the Lender Group under this Agreement, for the mutual benefit, directly and indirectly, of each other Borrower and in consideration of the undertakings of the other Global Borrowers to accept joint and
            several liability for the Obligations of the Borrowers.  For the avoidance of doubt, the German Borrower is not jointly and severally liable for any Global Borrowers’ liability for the Obligations of such Global Borrowers.
 
(b)          Each such Global Borrower, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with
            such other applicable Borrowers, with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations of such other Borrower (including any Obligations arising under this Section 2.15), it being the intention of the parties hereto that
            all the Obligations of such other applicable Global Borrower shall be the joint and several obligations of each such Global Borrower without preferences or distinction among them.  Accordingly, each Borrower hereby waives any and all suretyship
            defenses that would otherwise be available to such Global Borrower under applicable law.
 
(c)          If and to the extent that any such Borrower shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of such Obligations as and when due, whether upon maturity, acceleration, or
            otherwise, or to perform any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such event the other applicable Global Borrowers will make such payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligations until such time as all of
            such Obligations are paid in full, and without the need for demand, protest, or any other notice or formality.
 
(d)        The Obligations of each Global Borrower under the provisions of this Section 2.15 constitute the absolute and unconditional, full recourse Obligations of each Global Borrower
            enforceable against each Global Borrower to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the provisions of this Agreement (other than this Section 2.15(d)) or any other
            circumstances whatsoever.
 

-120-

 

(e)         Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each Global Borrower hereby waives presentments, demands for
            performance, protests and notices, including notices of acceptance of its joint and several liability, notice of any Revolving Loans or any Letters of Credit issued under or pursuant to this Agreement, notice of the occurrence of any Default,
            Event of Default, notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Agreement, notices of the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional Obligations or other financial accommodations
            or of any demand for any payment under this Agreement, notice of any action at any time taken or omitted by Agent or Lenders under or in respect of any of the Obligations, any right to proceed against any other Global Borrower or any other
            Person, to proceed against or exhaust any security held from any other Global Borrower or any other Person, to protect, secure, perfect, or insure any security interest or Lien on any property subject thereto or exhaust any right to take any
            action against any other Global Borrower, any other Person, or any collateral, to pursue any other remedy in any member of the Lender Group’s or any Bank Product Provider’s power whatsoever, any requirement of diligence or to mitigate damages
            and, generally, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all demands, notices and other formalities of every kind in connection with this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement), any right to assert against any member of
            the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider, any defense (legal or equitable), set-off, counterclaim, or claim which each Global Borrower may now or at any time hereafter have against any other Global Borrower or any other party liable to any
            member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider, any defense, set-off, counterclaim, or claim, of any kind or nature, arising directly or indirectly from the present or future lack of perfection, sufficiency, validity, or enforceability
            of the Obligations or any security therefor, and any right or defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider including any defense based upon
            an impairment or elimination of such Borrower’s rights of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution, or indemnity of such Borrower against any other Global Borrower.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Global Borrower hereby
            assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or postponement of the time for the payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any partial payment thereon, any waiver, consent
            or other action or acquiescence by Agent or Lenders at any time or times in respect of any default by any Borrower in the performance or satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Agreement, any and all other indulgences
            whatsoever by Agent or Lenders in respect of any of the Obligations, and the taking, addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, at any time or times, of any security for any of the Obligations or the addition, substitution or
            release, in whole or in part, of any Global Borrower.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Global Borrower assents to any other action or delay in acting or failure to act on the part of any Agent or Lender with respect to
            the failure by any Borrower to comply with any of its respective Obligations, including any failure strictly or diligently to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to comply fully with applicable laws or regulations thereunder, which
            might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.15 afford grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving any Global Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its Obligations under this Section 2.15, it being the intention of
            each Global Borrower that, so long as any of the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the Obligations of each Global Borrower under this Section 2.15 shall not be discharged except by performance and then only to the extent of such
            performance.  The Obligations of each Global Borrower under this Section 2.15 shall not be diminished or rendered unenforceable by any winding up, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation, reconstruction or similar proceeding with
            respect to any other Borrower or any Agent or Lender.  Each of the Global Borrowers waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof.  Any
            payment by any Global Borrower or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to any Global Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to each of the Global Borrowers.  Each of the Global Borrowers
            waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Borrower or any other Person, other than payment of the Obligations to the extent of such payment, based on or arising out of the disability of any Borrower or any other Person,
            or the validity, legality, or unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Borrower other than payment of the Obligations to the extent of such payment.  Agent
            may, at the election of the Required Lenders, foreclose upon any Collateral held by Agent by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales or other dispositions, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable or otherwise
            fails to comply with applicable law or may exercise any other right or remedy Agent, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Bank Product Provider may have against any Borrower or any other Person, or any security, in each case, without
            affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any of the Global Borrowers hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been paid.
 
(f)          Each Global Borrower represents and warrants to Agent and Lenders that such Borrower is currently informed of the financial condition of the Borrowers and of all other circumstances
            which a diligent inquiry would reveal and which bear upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations.  Each Global Borrower further represents and warrants to Agent and Lenders that such Borrower has read and understands the terms and conditions
            of the Loan Documents.  Each Global Borrower hereby covenants that such Borrower will continue to keep informed of the Borrowers’ financial condition and of all other circumstances which bear upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance of the
            Obligations.
 

-121-

 

(g)         The provisions of this Section 2.15 are made for the benefit of Agent, each member of the Lender Group, each Bank Product Provider, and their respective successors and
            assigns, and may be enforced by it or them from time to time against any or all Global Borrowers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of Agent, any member of the Lender Group, any Bank Product Provider, or
            any of their successors or assigns first to marshal any of its or their claims or to exercise any of its or their rights against any Borrower or to exhaust any remedies available to it or them against any Borrower or to resort to any other
            source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy.  The provisions of this Section 2.15 shall remain in effect until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full or otherwise
            fully satisfied.  If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made in respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of
            any Global Borrower, or otherwise, the provisions of this Section 2.15 will forthwith be reinstated in effect, as though such payment had not been made.
 
(h)          Each Global Borrower hereby agrees that it will not enforce any of its rights that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the provisions of this Section

              2.15, including rights of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of Agent, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Bank Product Provider against
            any Borrower, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including the right to take or receive from any Borrower, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in
            any other manner, payment or security solely on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until such time as all of the applicable Obligations have been paid in full in cash.  Any claim which any Global Borrower may have against any
            other Borrower with respect to any payments to any Agent or any member of the Lender Group hereunder or under any of the Bank Product Agreements are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment, without limitation as to any
            increases in the applicable Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full in cash of the applicable Obligations and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other
            similar proceeding under the laws of any jurisdiction relating to any Borrower, its debts or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full in cash before any payment or distribution of any character,
            whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any other Borrower therefor.  If any amount shall be paid to any Global Borrower in violation of the immediately preceding sentence, such amount shall be held in trust for the
            benefit of Agent, for the benefit of the Lender Group and the Bank Product Providers, and shall forthwith be paid to Agent to be credited and applied to the applicable Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Agreement, whether
            matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or to be held as Collateral for any applicable Obligations or other amounts payable under this Agreement thereafter arising.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
            contained in this Agreement, no applicable Global Borrower may exercise any rights of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or other similar rights against, and may not proceed or seek recourse against or with respect to any
            property or asset of, any other applicable Borrower (the “Foreclosed Borrower”), including after payment in full of the Obligations, if all or any portion of the Obligations have been satisfied in connection with an exercise of remedies
            in respect of the Equity Interests of such Foreclosed Borrower whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.

2.16        Extensions of Revolver Commitments.
 
(a)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, pursuant to one or more offers (each, an “Extension Offer”) made from time to time by Administrative Borrower to
            all Lenders with Revolver Commitments with a like maturity date, in each case on a pro rata basis (based on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Revolver Commitments with a like maturity date) and on the same terms to each such
            Lender, Borrowers are hereby permitted to consummate from time to time transactions with individual Lenders that accept the terms contained in such Extension Offers to extend the maturity date of each such Lender’s Revolver Commitments and
            otherwise modify the terms of Revolver Commitments pursuant to the terms of the relevant Extension Offer (including by increasing the interest rate margin, interest rate floor, all-in yield pricing or fees payable in respect of Revolver
            Commitments (and related outstandings)) (each, an “Extension,” and each portion of Revolver Commitments in each case as so extended, as well as  the original Revolver Commitments (in each case not so extended), being a “tranche”;
            any Extended Revolver Commitments shall constitute a separate tranche of Revolver Commitments from the tranche of Revolver Commitments from which they were converted), in each case, so long as each of the following terms is satisfied:  (i) no
            Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time the offering document in respect of an Extension Offer is delivered to the Lenders, (ii) except as to interest rate margin, interest rate floor, all-in yield pricing, fees,
            AHYDO Payments, optional redemption or prepayment terms, final maturity, and after the final maturity date of the other existing Revolver Commitments, any other covenants and provisions (which shall be determined by Borrowers and the Extending
            Revolver Lenders and set forth in the relevant Extension Offer), the Revolver Commitment of any Lender (an “Extending Revolver Lender”) extended pursuant to an Extension (an “Extended Revolver Commitment”), and the related
            outstandings, shall be a Revolver Commitment (or related outstandings, as the case may be) with such other terms substantially identical to, or not more favorable to the Extending Revolver Lenders than those applicable to the Revolver
            Commitments not subject to such Extension Offer (and related outstandings); provided, that (1) the borrowing and repayment (except for (A) payments of interest and fees at different rates on Extended Revolver Commitments (and related
            outstandings), (B) repayments required upon the maturity date of the non-extending Revolver Commitments, and (C) repayment made in connection with a permanent repayment and termination of commitments) of Revolving Loans with respect to Extended
            Revolver Commitments after the applicable Extension date shall be made on a pro rata basis with all other Revolver Commitments, (2) all Swing Loans and Letters of Credit shall be participated on a pro rata basis by all Lenders with Revolver
            Commitments in accordance with their percentage of the Revolver Commitments subject to the express terms herein, (3) the permanent repayment of Revolving Loans with respect to, and termination of, Extended Revolver Commitments after the
            applicable Extension date shall be made on a pro rata basis with all other Revolver Commitments, except that Borrowers shall be permitted to permanently repay and terminate commitments of any tranche on a better than a pro rata basis as
            compared to any other tranche with a later maturity date than such tranche, (4) assignments and participations of Extended Revolver Commitments and extended Revolving Loans shall be governed by the same assignment and participation provisions
            applicable to Revolver Commitments and Revolving Loans, and (5) at no time shall there be Revolver Commitments hereunder (including Extended Revolver Commitments and any original Revolver Commitments) which have more than three different
            maturity dates, (vii) to the extent that the interest rate margin, interest rate floor, all-in yield pricing or fees are increased for the benefit of any Extending Revolver Lender that is payable prior to the payment in full of the Obligations
            of Lenders that are not Extending Revolver Lenders under such Extension Offer, such non-extending Lenders have the right to receive the aggregate value of such increase from and after the date that such interest rate margin, interest rate
            floor, all-in yield pricing or fees (as applicable) accrues in favor of or is payable to any such Extending Revolver Lenders, (viii) if the aggregate principal amount of Revolver Commitments in respect of which Lenders shall have accepted the
            relevant Extension Offer shall exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of Revolver Commitments offered to be extended by Borrowers pursuant to such Extension Offer, then the Revolver Commitments of such Lenders shall be extended ratably
            up to such maximum amount based on the respective principal amounts (but not to exceed actual holdings or commitments of record) with respect to which such Lenders have accepted such Extension Offer, (ix) Borrowers shall have delivered to Agent
            such legal opinions, certificates, resolutions and other documents as Agent shall reasonably request with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.16, (x) all documentation in respect of such Extension shall be
            consistent with the foregoing, (xi) the Revolver Commitments extended pursuant to any Extension Offer shall be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000 and increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (xii) any Extension made pursuant to any
            Extension Offer must be consummated within 30 days of such Extension Offer.
 

-123-

 

(b)        With respect to all Extensions consummated by Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.16, such Extension shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments for
            purposes of this Agreement.  Agent and the Lenders hereby consent to the Extensions and the other transactions contemplated by this Section 2.16 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment of any interest, fees or premium in respect
            of any Extended Revolver Commitments on such terms as may be set forth in the relevant Extension Offer) and hereby waive the requirements of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that may otherwise prohibit any such
            Extension or any other transaction contemplated by this Section 2.16.
 
(c)         No consent of any Lender or Agent shall be required to effectuate any Extension, other than (i) the consent of each Lender agreeing to such Extension with respect to its Revolver
            Commitments (or a portion thereof), and (ii) with respect to any Extension of the Revolver Commitments, the consent of the Issuing Bank or Swing Lenders to the extent the Letter of Credit facility and/or Swing Loan facility is to be extended,
            which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.  All Extended Revolver Commitments and all obligations in respect thereof shall be Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that are secured by the
            Collateral on a pari passu basis with all other applicable Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize Agent to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other
            Loan Documents with the Loan Parties as may be necessary or appropriate in order to establish new tranches or sub-tranches in respect of Revolver Commitments so extended, that reflect the terms and conditions of any such Extension and such
            technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of Agent and Borrowers in connection with the establishment of such new tranches or sub-tranches, in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.16. 

            All such amendments entered into with the Loan Parties by Agent hereunder shall be binding and conclusive on the Lenders.  In addition, if so provided in such amendment and with the consent of Issuing Bank, participations in Letters of Credit
            expiring on or after the Maturity Date in respect of the Revolving Loans shall be re-allocated from Lenders holding Revolver Commitments to Lenders holding Extended Revolver Commitments in accordance with the terms of such amendment; provided,
            that such participation interests shall, upon receipt thereof by the relevant Lenders holding Extended Revolver Commitments, be deemed to be participation interests in respect of such Extended Revolver Commitments and the terms of such
            participation interests (including the fees applicable thereto) shall be adjusted accordingly. Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with any Extensions the respective Loan Parties shall (at their expense) amend (and Agent is hereby
            directed to amend) any Mortgage that has a maturity date prior to the then Latest Maturity Date so that such maturity date is extended to the then Latest Maturity Date hereunder (or such later date as may be reasonably advised by local counsel
            to Agent).  On and after the maturity date with respect to the Revolver Commitment and Revolving Loans of any Lender that has not extended its Revolver Commitments and Revolving Loans beyond such maturity date pursuant to this Section 2.16,
            the Letter of Credit Exposure of such Revolving Lender shall be reallocated to Revolving Lenders that have extended their Revolving Loans and Revolver Commitments beyond such maturity date pro rata in accordance with the Revolver Commitments
            and Revolving Loans of all Revolving Lenders that have so extended their Revolver Commitments and Revolving Loans.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.16, Agent shall have the right to resign on the Maturity Date in
            accordance with Section 15.9.
 

-124-

 

(d)         In connection with any Extension, Borrowers shall provide Agent at least ten days (or such shorter period as may be agreed by Agent) prior
            written notice thereof, and shall agree to such procedures (including rendering timing, rounding and other adjustments and to ensure reasonable administrative management of the credit facilities hereunder after such Extension), if any, as may
            be established by, or acceptable to, Agent, in each case acting reasonably to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.16.
 
3.           CONDITIONS; TERM OF AGREEMENT.
 
3.1         Conditions Precedent to the Initial Extension of Credit.  The obligation of each Lender to make
            the initial extensions of credit provided for hereunder is subject to the fulfillment, to the satisfaction of Agent and each Lender, of each of the conditions precedent set forth on Schedule 3.1 to this Agreement (the making of such
            initial extensions of credit by a Lender being conclusively deemed to be its satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent).
 
3.2         Conditions Precedent to all Extensions of Credit.  The obligation of the Lender Group (or any
            member thereof) to make any Revolving Loans hereunder (or to extend any other credit hereunder), and the Issuing Banks to issue, amend to increase the face amount of, or extend any Letter of Credit, at any time shall be subject to the following
            conditions precedent, which, in the case of a Revolving Loan incurred solely to finance a substantially concurrent Limited Condition Acquisition, shall be subject to Section 1.07:
 
(a)         the representations and warranties of each Loan Party or its Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material
            respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof) on and as of the date of such extension of credit, as
            though made on and as of such date (except to the extent that such representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects (except
            that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof) as of such earlier date);
 
(b)          at the time of and immediately upon giving effect to any Credit Extension, the Availability Conditions shall be satisfied; and
 
(c)         no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such extension of credit, nor shall either result from the making thereof.
 
3.3        Maturity. The Commitments shall continue in full force and effect for a term ending on the
            Latest Maturity Date (unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms hereof).
 

-125-

 

3.4        Effect of Maturity.  On the Latest Maturity Date, all commitments of the Lender Group to provide
            additional credit hereunder shall automatically be terminated and all of the Obligations (other than Hedge Obligations) immediately shall become due and payable without notice or demand and Borrowers shall be required to repay all of the
            Obligations (other than Hedge Obligations) in full.  No termination of the obligations of the Lender Group (other than payment in full of the Obligations and termination of the Commitments) shall relieve or discharge any Loan Party of its
            duties, obligations, or covenants hereunder or under any other Loan Document and Agent’s Liens in the Collateral shall continue to secure the Obligations and shall remain in effect until all Obligations have been paid in full.  When all of the
            Obligations have been paid in full, Agent will, at Borrowers’ sole expense, execute and deliver any termination statements, lien releases, discharges of security interests, and other similar discharge or release documents (and, if applicable,
            in recordable form) as are reasonably necessary to release, as of record, Agent’s Liens and all notices of security interests and liens previously filed by Agent.
 
3.5          Early Termination by Borrowers.  Borrowers have the option, at any time upon five Business
            Days prior written notice to Agent, to repay all of the Obligations in full and terminate the Commitments.  The foregoing notwithstanding, (a) Borrowers may rescind termination notices relative to proposed payments in full of the Obligations
            with the proceeds of third party Indebtedness if the closing for such issuance or incurrence does not happen on or before the date of the proposed termination (in which case, a new notice shall be required to be sent in connection with any
            subsequent termination), and (b) Borrowers may extend the date of termination at any time with the consent of Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
 
3.6        Conditions Subsequent.  The obligation of the Lender Group (or any member thereof) to continue to make Revolving Loans (or otherwise
            extend credit hereunder) is subject to the fulfillment, on or before the date applicable thereto, of the conditions subsequent set forth on Schedule 3.6 to this Agreement (the failure by Borrowers to so perform or cause to be performed
            such conditions subsequent as and when required by the terms thereof (unless such date is extended, in writing, by Agent, which Agent may do without obtaining the consent of the other members of the Lender Group), shall constitute an Event of
            Default).
 
4.          REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.
 
In order to induce the Lender Group to enter into this Agreement, each Borrower and the other Loan Parties makes the following representations and warranties to the Lender Group which shall be
            true, correct, and complete, in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof), as of the
            Closing Date, and shall be true, correct, and complete, in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the
            text thereof), as of the date of the making of each Revolving Loan (or other extension of credit) made thereafter, as though made on and as of the date of such Revolving Loan (or other extension of credit) (except to the extent that such
            representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall 

sdiction) under the
            laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, except with respect to any Immaterial Subsidiaries that are not Loan Parties to the extent that failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
            Effect, (ii) has the power and authority to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being and hereafter proposed to be conducted and (iii) is duly qualified and authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
            character of its Properties or the nature of its business requires such qualification and authorization except in jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
            Adverse Effect.
 
(b)         The jurisdictions in which each Loan Party and each Subsidiary thereof is organized as of the Closing Date are described on Schedule 4.1(a).  Schedule 4.1(a)
            identifies each Borrower and Guarantor as of the Closing Date.
 
(c)           No Loan Party nor any Subsidiary thereof is an Affected Financial Institution.

            Sanctions, Anti-Corruption Laws and Anti-Money Laundering Laws. Each of the Loan Parties, its directors, its officers, its Subsidiaries and its Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and to the best knowledge of each such Loan Party, each employee, agent
            and Affiliate of each such Loan Party, each such Subsidiary and each such Unrestricted Subsidiary, is in compliance with all Sanctions, Anti-Corruption Laws and Anti-Money Laundering Laws.  No proceeds of any Loan made or Letter of Credit

            to any collective bargaining agreement, nor has any labor union been recognized as the representative of its employees except as set forth on Schedule 4.18.  The Borrower knows of no pending, threatened or contemplated strikes, work
            stoppage or other collective labor disputes involving its employees or those of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            to Agent, such Account is (a) a bona fide existing payment obligation of the applicable Account Debtor created by the sale and delivery of Inventory or the rendition of services to such Account Debtor in the ordinary course of a Borrower’s
            business, (b) owed to a Borrower without any known defenses, disputes, offsets, counterclaims, or rights of return or cancellation, and (c) not excluded as ineligible by virtue of one or more of the excluding criteria (other than any

            accurate records itemizing and describing the type, quality, and quantity of its and its Subsidiaries’ Inventory and the book value thereof.
 
4.23        Financial Statements. The audited and unaudited financial statements delivered pursuant to Schedule 3.1 fairly present on a
            Consolidated basis the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Administrative Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at such dates, and the results of the operations and changes of financial position for the periods then ended (other than
            customary year-end adjustments for unaudited financial statements and the absence of footnotes from unaudited financial statements). All such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in all
            material respects in accordance with GAAP. Such financial statements show all material indebtedness and other material liabilities, direct or contingent, of the Administrative Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof, including
            material liabilities for taxes, material commitments, and Indebtedness, in each case, to the extent required to be disclosed under GAAP (except, in the case of any interim financial statements, for any disclosures that would otherwise appear in
            any accompanying footnotes). The financial projections delivered pursuant to Schedule 3.1 represent the good faith estimates (utilizing assumptions believed in good faith to be reasonable at such time) of the financial condition and
            operations of the Administrative Borrower and its Subsidiaries (it being recognized by the Lenders that projections are not to be viewed as facts and that the actual results during the period or periods covered by such projections, many of
            which are beyond the control of the Administrative Borrower and its Subsidiaries, may vary from such projections and that such difference may be material and that such projections are not a guarantee of financial performance).
 
4.24        Absence of Defaults. No event has occurred or is continuing that constitutes a Default or an Event of Default.
 
4.25       Immaterial Subsidiaries. As of the Closing Date, the Immaterial Subsidiaries organized in the US, UK, Canada, and Germany are as set
            forth on Schedule 4.25.

Each  Borrower covenants and agrees that, until the termination of all of the Commitments and payment in full of the Obligations:
 
5.1         Financial Statements, Reports, Certificates.  Borrowers (a) will deliver to Agent, with copies

            will have a fiscal year different from that of Administrative Borrower, (c) agree to maintain a system of accounting that enables Borrowers to produce financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and (d) agree that they will, and will cause

            systems and practices substantially as in effect as of the Closing Date and shall only make material modifications thereto with notice to, and with the consent of, Agent.
 

-134-

            each Lender) each of the reports set forth on Schedule 5.2 to this Agreement at the times specified therein, and (b) agree to use commercially reasonable efforts in cooperation with Agent to facilitate and implement a system of
            electronic collateral reporting in order to provide electronic reporting of each of the items set forth on such Schedule. Borrowers and Agent hereby agree that the delivery of the Borrowing Base Certificate through Agent’s electronic platform
            or portal, subject to Agent’s authentication process, by such other electronic method as may be approved by Agent from time to time in its sole discretion, or by such other electronic input of information necessary to calculate the Borrowing
            Base as may be approved by Agent from time to time in its sole discretion, shall in each case be deemed to satisfy the obligation of Borrowers to deliver such Borrowing Base Certificate, with the same legal effect as if such Borrowing Base
            Certificate had been manually executed by Borrowers and delivered to Agent.
 
5.3          Existence.  Except as otherwise permitted under Section 6.3 or Section 6.4,
            each Loan Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect such Person’s valid existence and good standing in its jurisdiction of organization and, except as could not reasonably be
            expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, good standing with respect to all other jurisdictions in which it is qualified to do business and any rights, franchises, permits, licenses, accreditations, authorizations, or other approvals
            material to their businesses.
 
5.4         Maintenance of Properties.  Each Loan Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
            maintain and preserve all of its assets that are necessary or useful in the proper conduct of its business in good working order and condition, ordinary wear, tear, casualty, and condemnation and Asset Dispositions permitted hereunder excepted
            (and except where the failure to so maintain and preserve assets could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect).
 
5.5        Taxes.  Each Loan Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay, discharge or
            otherwise satisfy all Taxes that may be levied or assessed upon it or any of its Property, except where the failure to pay or perform could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or to
            give rise to a Lien on the Collateral (other than a Permitted Lien pursuant to Section 6.2(c)), other than to the extent that the validity of such Tax is the subject of a Permitted Protest.
 
5.6          Insurance.
 
(a)          Each Loan Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, at Borrowers’ expense, maintain insurance respecting each of each Loan Party’s and its Subsidiaries’ assets
            wherever located, covering liabilities, losses or damages as are customarily are insured against by other Persons engaged in same or similar businesses and similarly situated and located.  All such policies of insurance shall be with
            financially sound and reputable insurance companies acceptable to Agent (it being agreed that, as of the Closing Date, the Loan Parties’ existing insurance providers as set forth in the certificates of insurance delivered to Agent on or about
            the Closing Date shall be deemed to be acceptable to Agent) and in such amounts as is carried generally in accordance with sound business practice by companies in similar businesses similarly situated and located and, in any event, in amount,
            adequacy, and scope reasonably satisfactory to Agent (it being agreed that the amount, adequacy, and scope of the policies of insurance of Borrowers in effect as of the Closing Date are acceptable to Agent).  All property insurance policies are
            to be made payable to Agent for the benefit of Agent and the Lenders, as their interests may appear, in case of loss, pursuant to a standard lender’s loss payable endorsement with a standard non-contributory “lender” or “secured party” clause. 
            All certificates of property and general liability insurance are to be delivered to Agent, with the lender’s loss payable and additional insured endorsements in favor of Agent and shall provide for not less than thirty days (ten days in the
            case of non-payment) prior written notice to Agent of the exercise of any right of cancellation.  If any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries fails to maintain such insurance, Agent may arrange for such insurance, but at Borrowers’ expense and
            without any responsibility on Agent’s part for obtaining the insurance, the solvency of the insurance companies, the adequacy of the coverage, or the collection of claims.

(b)         Borrowers shall give Agent prompt notice of any loss exceeding $5,000,000 covered by the casualty or business interruption insurance of any Loan Party or is Subsidiaries. Upon the
            occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Agent shall have the sole right to file claims under any property and general liability insurance policies in respect of the Collateral, to receive, receipt and give acquittance for
            any payments that may be payable thereunder, and to execute any and all endorsements, receipts, releases, assignments, reassignments or other documents that may be necessary to effect the collection, compromise or settlement of any claims under
            any such insurance policies.
 
(c)        If at any time the area in which any Real Property that is subject to a Mortgage is located is designated a “flood hazard area” in any Flood Insurance Rate Map published by the
            Federal Emergency Management Agency (or any successor agency), obtain flood insurance in such total amount and on terms that are satisfactory to Agent and all Lenders from time to time, and otherwise comply with the Flood Laws or as is
            otherwise satisfactory to Agent and all Lenders.
 
5.7          Inspection.
 
(a)        Each Loan Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, permit Agent, any Lender, and each of their respective duly authorized representatives or agents to visit any of its
            properties and inspect any of its assets or books and records, to examine and make copies of its books and records, and to discuss its affairs, finances, and accounts with, and to be advised as to the same by, its officers and employees (provided,
            that an authorized representative of a Borrower shall be allowed to be present) at such reasonable times and intervals as Agent or any Lender, as applicable, may designate and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is

            Persons, the Lender-Related Persons, the Issuing Bank, and each Participant (each, an “Indemnified Person”) harmless (to the fullest extent permitted by law) from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, investigations,
            proceedings, liabilities, fines, costs, penalties, and damages, and all reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys, experts, or consultants and all other costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith or in connection with the
            enforcement of this indemnification (as and when they are incurred and irrespective of whether suit is brought), at any time asserted against, imposed upon, or incurred by any of them (a) in connection with or as a result of or related to the
            execution and delivery (provided, that Borrowers shall not be liable for costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) of any Lender (other than Wells Fargo and its Affiliates) incurred in advising, structuring, drafting, reviewing,
            administering or syndicating the Loan Documents), enforcement, performance, or administration (including any restructuring or workout with respect hereto) of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, or the transactions contemplated
            hereby or thereby or the monitoring of Loan Parties’ and their Subsidiaries’ compliance with the terms of the Loan Documents (provided, that the indemnification in this clause (a) shall not extend to (i) disputes solely between or among
            the Lenders that do not involve any acts or omissions of any Loan Party, or (ii) disputes solely between or among the Lenders and their respective Affiliates that do not involve any acts or omissions of any Loan Party; it being understood and
            agreed that the indemnification in this clause (a) shall extend to Agent (but not the Lenders unless the dispute involves an act or omission of a Loan Party) relative to disputes between or among Agent on the one hand, and one or more Lenders,
            or one or more of their Affiliates, on the other hand, or (iii) any claims for Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 16, other than Taxes which relate to primarily non-Tax claims), (b) with respect to any actual or prospective
            investigation, litigation, or proceeding related to this Agreement, any other Loan Document, the making of any Loans or issuance of any Letters of Credit hereunder, or the use of the proceeds of the Loans or the Letters of Credit provided
            hereunder (irrespective of whether any Indemnified Person is a party thereto), or any act, omission, event, or circumstance in any manner related thereto, and (c) in connection with or arising out of any presence or release of Hazardous
            Materials at, on, under, to or from any assets or properties owned, leased or operated by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any Environmental Actions, Environmental Liabilities or Remedial Actions related in any way to any such
            assets or properties of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries (each and all of the foregoing, the “Indemnified Liabilities”).  The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, no Borrower shall have any obligation to any Indemnified
            Person under this Section 10.3 with respect to any Indemnified Liability that a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person or
            its officers, directors, employees, attorneys, or agents.  This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment in full of the Obligations.  If any Indemnified Person makes any payment to any other Indemnified Person
            with respect to an Indemnified Liability as to which Borrowers were required to indemnify the Indemnified Person receiving such payment, the Indemnified Person making such payment is entitled to be indemnified and reimbursed by Borrowers with
            respect thereto.  WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY SHALL APPLY TO EACH INDEMNIFIED PERSON WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES WHICH IN WHOLE OR IN PART ARE CAUSED BY OR ARISE OUT OF ANY NEGLIGENT
              ACT OR OMISSION OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED PERSON OR OF ANY OTHER PERSON.

-165-

 

(ii)          Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:

(B)         no assignment may be made to a Loan Party or an Affiliate of a Loan Party,

            of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to Agent) shall be in a minimum amount (unless waived by Agent) of $5,000,000 (except such minimum amount shall not apply to (I) an assignment or delegation
            by any Lender to any other Lender, an Affiliate of any Lender, or a Related Fund of such Lender, or (II) a group of new Lenders, each of which is an Affiliate of each other or a Related Fund of such new Lender to the extent that the aggregate

(D)      each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement,
 
(E)         the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to Agent an Assignment and Acceptance; provided, that Borrowers and Agent may continue to deal solely and directly
            with the assigning Lender in connection with the interest so assigned to an Assignee until written notice of such assignment, together with payment instructions, addresses, and related information with respect to the Assignee, have been given
            to Borrowers and Agent by such Lender and the Assignee,
 
(F)         unless waived by Agent, the assigning Lender or Assignee has paid to Agent, for Agent’s separate account, a processing fee in the amount of $3,500, and
 
(G)       the assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in a form approved by Agent (the “Administrative Questionnaire”).
 
(b)          From and after the date that Agent receives the executed Assignment and Acceptance and, if applicable, payment of the required processing fee, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a
            party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall be a “Lender” and shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, (ii)
            the assigning Lender shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights (except with respect to Section
              10.3) and be released from any future obligations under this Agreement (and in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the
            other Loan Documents, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto and thereto) and (iii) the Assignee shall be deemed to have appointed the Agent (acting through its London Branch) to act as security trustee for it on the terms set out in the
            Loan Documents; provided, that nothing contained herein shall release any assigning Lender from obligations that survive the termination of this Agreement, including such assigning Lender’s obligations under Section 15 and Section

              17.9(a).
 

-166-

 

(c)          By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning Lender thereunder and the Assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties
            hereto as follows:  (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or
            in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto, (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation
            or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Loan Party or the performance or observance by any Loan Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant
            hereto, (iii) such Assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and
            Acceptance, (iv) such Assignee will, independently and without reliance upon Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit
            decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement, (v) such Assignee appoints and authorizes Agent to take such actions and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to Agent, by the
            terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, and (vi) such Assignee agrees that it will perform all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a
            Lender.
 
(d)          Immediately upon Agent’s receipt of the required processing fee, if applicable, and delivery of notice to the assigning Lender pursuant to Section 13.1(b), this Agreement
            shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising therefrom.  The Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce
            such Commitments of the assigning Lender pro tanto.
 
(e)          Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks, financial institutions, or other Persons (a “Participant”) participating interests in all or any portion of
            its Obligations, its Commitment, and the other rights and interests of that Lender (the “Originating Lender”) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; provided, that (i) the Originating Lender shall remain a “Lender” for all
            purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the Participant receiving the participating interest in the Obligations, the Commitments, and the other rights and interests of the Originating Lender hereunder shall not constitute a
            “Lender” hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and the Originating Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the Originating Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations,
            (iii) Borrowers, Agent, and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Originating Lender in connection with the Originating Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (iv) no Lender
            shall transfer or grant any participating interest under which the Participant has the right to approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except to the extent such amendment
            to, or consent or waiver with respect to this Agreement or of any other Loan Document would (A) extend the final maturity date of the Obligations hereunder in which such Participant is participating, (B) reduce the interest rate applicable to
            the Obligations hereunder in which such Participant is participating, (C) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or guaranties (except to the extent expressly provided herein or in any of the Loan Documents) supporting the
            Obligations hereunder in which such Participant is participating, (D) postpone the payment of, or reduce the amount of, the interest or fees payable to such Participant through such Lender (other than a waiver of default interest), or (E)
            decrease the amount or postpone the due dates of scheduled principal repayments or prepayments or premiums payable to such Participant through such Lender, (v) no participation shall be sold to a natural person, (vi) no participation shall be
            sold to a Loan Party or an Affiliate of a Loan Party, and (vii) all amounts payable by Borrowers hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation, except that, if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due
            and unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing
            under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement.  The rights of any Participant only shall be derivative through the Originating Lender with whom
            such Participant participates and no Participant shall have any rights under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any direct rights as to the other Lenders, Agent, Borrowers, the Collateral, or otherwise in respect of the Obligations. 
            No Participant shall have the right to participate directly in the making of decisions by the Lenders among themselves.
 

-167-

 

(f)          In connection with any such assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation or any grant of a security interest in, or pledge of, its rights under and interest
            in this Agreement, a Lender may, subject to the provisions of Section 17.9, disclose all documents and information which it now or hereafter may have relating to any Loan Party and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses.
 
(g)          Any other provision in this Agreement notwithstanding, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of its rights under and interest in
            this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Bank or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR §203.24, and such Federal Reserve Bank
            may enforce such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under applicable law; provided, that no such pledge shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such
            Lender as a party hereto.
 
13.2        Successors.  This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors
            and assigns of each of the parties; provided, that no Borrower may assign this Agreement or any rights or duties hereunder without the Lenders’ prior written consent and any prohibited assignment shall be absolutely void ab initio.  No consent to assignment by the Lenders shall release any Borrower from its Obligations.  A Lender may assign this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and its rights and duties hereunder and
            thereunder pursuant to Section 13.1 and, except as expressly required pursuant to Section 13.1, no consent or approval by any Borrower is required in connection with any such assignment.
 
13.3        Register and Participant Register
 
(a)          The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain a copy of each assignment delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
            addresses of the Lenders, and the terms of, and principal amounts (and related interest amounts) and currencies of the Loans, owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the
            Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
            Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In addition, the Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender.  The Register shall be
            available for inspection by the Borrower, any Agent and any Lender (solely with respect to such Lender’s own interests only), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(b)         The applicable Lender, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant,
            and the amount of each Participant’s interest in such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the
            Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the
            extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103- 1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant
            Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of the applicable rights and/or obligations of such Lender under this Agreement. For the
            avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

            upon at least five Business Days of providing notice, may permanently replace any Lender that failed to give its consent, authorization, or agreement (a “Non-Consenting Lender”) or any Lender that made a claim for compensation (a “Tax
              Lender”) with one or more Replacement Lenders (subject to the consent of the Issuing Banks to the extent such Replacement Lender is not an existing Lender), and the Non-Consenting Lender or Tax Lender, as applicable, shall have no right
            to refuse to be replaced hereunder.  Such notice to replace the Non-Consenting Lender or Tax Lender, as applicable, shall specify an effective date for such replacement, which date shall not be later than 15 Business Days after the date such
            notice is given.
 
(b)         Prior to the effective date of such replacement, the Non-Consenting Lender or Tax Lender, as applicable, and each Replacement Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and
            Acceptance, subject only to the Non-Consenting Lender or Tax Lender, as applicable, being repaid in full its share of the outstanding Obligations (without any premium or penalty of any kind whatsoever, but including (i) all interest, fees and other amounts that may be due in payable in respect thereof, (ii) an assumption of its Pro Rata Share of participations in the Letters of Credit, and (iii) Funding Losses).  If the Non-Consenting
            Lender or Tax Lender, as applicable, shall refuse or fail to execute and deliver any such Assignment and Acceptance prior to the effective date of such replacement, Agent may, but shall not be required to, execute and deliver such Assignment
            and Acceptance in the name or and on behalf of the Non-Consenting Lender or Tax Lender, as applicable, and irrespective of whether Agent executes and delivers such Assignment and Acceptance, the Non-Consenting Lender or Tax Lender, as
            applicable, shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance.  The replacement of any Non-Consenting Lender or Tax Lender, as applicable, shall be made in accordance with the terms of Section 13.1.  Until
            such time as one or more Replacement Lenders shall have acquired all of the Obligations, the Commitments, and the other rights and obligations of the Non-Consenting Lender or Tax Lender, as applicable, hereunder and under the other Loan
            Documents, the Non-Consenting Lender or Tax Lender, as applicable, shall remain obligated to make the Non-Consenting Lender’s or Tax Lender’s, as applicable, Pro Rata Share of Revolving Loans and to purchase a participation in each Letter of
            Credit, in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of participations in such Letters of Credit.
 
14.3       No Waivers; Cumulative Remedies.  No failure by Agent or any Lender to exercise any right,
            remedy, or option under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or delay by Agent or any Lender in exercising the same, will operate as a waiver thereof.  No waiver by Agent or any Lender will be effective unless it is in writing, and then
            only to the extent specifically stated.  No waiver by Agent or any Lender on any occasion shall affect or diminish Agent’s and each Lender’s rights thereafter to require strict performance by the Borrowers of any provision of this Agreement. 
            Agent’s and each Lender’s rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents will be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy that Agent or any Lender may have.

15.         AGENT; THE LENDER GROUP.
 
15.1        Appointment and Authorization of Agent.  Each Lender hereby designates and appoints Wells Fargo
            as its agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to designate, appoint, and authorize) Agent
            to execute and deliver each of the other Loan Documents on its behalf and to take such other action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are
            expressly delegated to Agent by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Agent agrees to act as agent for and on behalf of the Lenders (and the Bank Product
            Providers) on the conditions contained in this Section 15 and the UK Security Agent agrees to act as security trustee for and on behalf of the Lenders (and the Bank Product Providers) to hold on trust the security interests constituted
            by the UK Security Documents and the German Security Agreements as security trustee on the conditions contained in the UK Security Documents.  By signing this Agreement each Lender shall be deemed to have appointed the Agent (acting through its
            London Branch) to act as security trustee for it on the terms set out in the Loan Documents.  Any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document notwithstanding, Agent shall not have any duties or
            responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents, nor shall Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender (or Bank Product Provider), and no implied covenants, functions,
            responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against Agent.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term “agent” or “trustee” in
            this Agreement or the other Loan Documents with reference to Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine or trusteeship doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead, such
            term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only a representative relationship between independent contracting parties.  Each Lender hereby further authorizes (and by entering into a Bank Product
            Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to authorize) Agent to act as the secured party under each of the Loan Documents that create a Lien on any item of Collateral.  Except as expressly otherwise provided in this Agreement,
            Agent shall have and may use its sole discretion with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any discretionary rights or taking or refraining from taking any actions that Agent expressly is entitled to take or assert under or
            pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, or of any other provision of the Loan Documents that provides rights or powers to Agent, Lenders agree that Agent shall have the right
            to exercise the following powers as long as this Agreement remains in effect:  (a) maintain, in accordance with its customary business practices, ledgers and records reflecting the status of the Obligations, the Collateral, payments and
            proceeds of Collateral, and related matters, (b) execute or file any and all financing or similar statements or notices, amendments, renewals, supplements, documents, instruments, proofs of claim, notices and other written agreements with
            respect to the Loan Documents, or to take any other action with respect to any Collateral or Loan Documents which may be necessary to perfect, and maintain perfected, the security interests and Liens upon Collateral pursuant to the Loan
            Documents, (c) make Revolving Loans, for itself or on behalf of Lenders, as provided in the Loan Documents, (d) exclusively receive, apply, and distribute payments and proceeds of the Collateral as provided in the Loan Documents, (e) open and
            maintain such bank accounts and cash management arrangements as Agent deems necessary and appropriate in accordance with the Loan Documents for the foregoing purposes, (f) perform, exercise, and enforce any and all other rights and remedies of
            the Lender Group with respect to any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries, the Obligations, the Collateral, or otherwise related to any of same as provided in the Loan Documents, and (g) incur and pay such Lender Group Expenses as Agent may deem
            necessary or appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its functions and powers pursuant to the Loan Documents.
 

-172-

 

15.2        Delegation of Duties.  Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other
            Loan Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys in fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.  Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or
            attorney in fact that it selects as long as such selection was made without gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 
15.3        Liability of Agent.  None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (a) be liable for any action taken
            or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (b) be responsible in any manner
            to any of the Lenders (or Bank Product Providers) for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any officer or director thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any
            other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness,
            genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.  No
            Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lenders (or Bank Product Providers) to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other
            Loan Document, or to inspect the books and records or properties of any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries.  No Agent-Related Person shall have any liability to any Lender, and Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates if any request for a
            Loan, Letter of Credit or other extension of credit was not authorized by the applicable Borrower.  Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or in the opinion of its counsel, may expose it to liability or that is
            contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law or regulation.
 
15.4      Reliance by Agent.  Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying,
            upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, telefacsimile or other electronic method of transmission, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be
            genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Borrowers or counsel to any Lender), independent accountants and other experts
            selected by Agent.  Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless Agent shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Lenders as it deems appropriate and
            until such instructions are received, Agent shall act, or refrain from acting, as it deems advisable.  If Agent so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders (and, if it so elects, the Bank Product
            Providers) against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
            Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders (and Bank Product Providers).
 

-173-

 

15.5       Notice of Default or Event of Default.  Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of
            the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest, fees, and expenses required to be paid to Agent for the account of the Lenders and, except with respect to Events of
            Default of which Agent has actual knowledge, unless Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or Borrowers referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default, and stating that such notice is a “notice of
            default.”  Agent promptly will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice or of any Event of Default of which Agent has actual knowledge.  If any Lender obtains actual knowledge of any Event of Default, such Lender promptly shall
            notify the other Lenders and Agent of such Event of Default.  Each Lender shall be solely responsible for giving any notices to its Participants, if any.  Subject to Section 15.4, Agent shall take such action with respect to such
            Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Required Lenders in accordance with Section 9; provided, that unless and until Agent has received any such request, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such
            action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable.
 
15.6        Credit Decision.  Each Lender (and Bank Product Provider) acknowledges that none of the
            Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of any Loan Party and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute any
            representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender (or Bank Product Provider).  Each Lender represents (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to represent) to Agent that it
            has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such due diligence, documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations,
            property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of each Borrower or any other Person party to a Loan Document, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to
            enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to Borrowers.  Each Lender also represents (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to represent) that it will, independently and without reliance
            upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the
            other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of each Borrower or any other Person party to a
            Loan Document.  Except for notices, reports, and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by Agent, Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender (or Bank Product Provider) with any credit
            or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any Borrower or any other Person party to a Loan Document that may come into the possession of any of the
            Agent-Related Persons.  Each Lender acknowledges (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to acknowledge) that Agent does not have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing
            basis (except to the extent, if any, that is expressly specified herein) to provide such Lender (or Bank Product Provider) with any credit or other information with respect to any Borrower, its Affiliates or any of their respective business,
            legal, financial or other affairs, and irrespective of whether such information came into Agent’s or its Affiliates’ or representatives’ possession before or after the date on which such Lender became a party to this Agreement (or such Bank
            Product Provider entered into a Bank Product Agreement).
 

-174-

 

15.7       Costs and Expenses; Indemnification.  Agent may incur and pay Lender Group Expenses to the
            extent Agent reasonably deems necessary or appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its functions, powers, and obligations pursuant to the Loan Documents, including court costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses, fees and expenses of
            financial accountants, advisors, consultants, and appraisers, costs of collection by outside collection agencies, auctioneer fees and expenses, and costs of security guards or insurance premiums paid to maintain the Collateral, whether or not
            Borrowers are obligated to reimburse Agent or Lenders for such expenses pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.  Agent is authorized and directed to deduct and retain sufficient amounts from payments or proceeds of the Collateral received by
            Agent to reimburse Agent for such out-of-pocket costs and expenses prior to the distribution of any amounts to Lenders (or Bank Product Providers).  In the event Agent is not reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Loan Parties and their
            Subsidiaries, each Lender hereby agrees that it is and shall be obligated to pay to Agent such Lender’s ratable share thereof.  Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each of the Lenders, on a ratable basis, shall
            indemnify and defend the Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of Borrowers to do so) from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities; provided, that no
            Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from such Person’s gross negligence or willful misconduct nor shall any Lender be liable for the obligations of
            any Defaulting Lender in failing to make a Revolving Loan or other extension of credit hereunder.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse Agent upon demand for such Lender’s ratable share of any costs or out of pocket
            expenses (including attorneys, accountants, advisors, and consultants fees and expenses) incurred by Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment, or enforcement (whether through
            negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the extent that Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of
            Borrowers.  The undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of Agent.
 
15.8        Agent in Individual Capacity.  Wells Fargo and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters
            of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, provide Bank Products to, acquire Equity Interests in, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting, or other business with any Loan Party and its
            Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any other Person party to any Loan Document as though Wells Fargo were not Agent hereunder, and, in each case, without notice to or consent of the other members of the Lender Group.  The other members of the
            Lender Group acknowledge (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to acknowledge) that, pursuant to such activities, Wells Fargo or its Affiliates may receive information regarding a Loan Party
            or its Affiliates or any other Person party to any Loan Documents that is subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such other Person and that prohibit the disclosure of such information to the Lenders (or Bank
            Product Providers), and the Lenders acknowledge (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to acknowledge) that, in such circumstances (and in the absence of a waiver of such confidentiality
            obligations, which waiver Agent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain), Agent shall not be under any obligation to provide such information to them.  The terms “Lender” and “Lenders” include Wells Fargo in its individual capacity.
 

-175-

 

15.9        Successor Agent.  Agent may resign as Agent upon 30 days (ten days if an Event of Default has
            occurred and is continuing) prior written notice to the Lenders (unless such notice is waived by the Required Lenders) and Borrowers (unless such notice is waived by Borrowers or a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) and
            without any notice to the Bank Product Providers.  If Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall be entitled, with (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) the consent of Borrowers (such consent not to
            be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned), appoint a successor Agent for the Lenders (and the Bank Product Providers).  If, at the time that Agent’s resignation is effective, it is acting as Issuing Bank or as a Swing Lender, such
            resignation shall also operate to effectuate its resignation as Issuing Bank or as a Swing Lender, as applicable, and it shall automatically be relieved of any further obligation to issue Letters of Credit, or to make Swing Loans.  If no
            successor Agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of Agent, Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and Borrowers, a successor Agent.  If Agent has materially breached or failed to perform any material
            provision of this Agreement or of applicable law, the Required Lenders may agree in writing to remove and replace Agent with a successor Agent from among the Lenders with (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) the
            consent of Borrowers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned).  In any such event, upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor Agent hereunder, such successor Agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers,
            and duties of the retiring Agent and the term “Agent” shall mean such successor Agent and the retiring Agent’s appointment, powers, and duties as Agent shall be terminated.  After any retiring Agent’s resignation hereunder as Agent, the
            provisions of this Section 15 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.  If no successor Agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date which is 30 days
            following a retiring Agent’s notice of resignation, the retiring Agent’s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Lenders
            appoint a successor Agent as provided for above.
 
15.10      Lender in Individual Capacity.  Any Lender and its respective Affiliates may make loans to,
            issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, provide Bank Products to, acquire Equity Interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting, or other business with any Loan Party
            and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any other Person party to any Loan Documents as though such Lender were not a Lender hereunder without notice to or consent of the other members of the Lender Group (or the Bank Product Providers).  The
            other members of the Lender Group acknowledge (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to acknowledge) that, pursuant to such activities, such Lender and its respective Affiliates may receive
            information regarding a Loan Party or its Affiliates or any other Person party to any Loan Documents that is subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such other Person and that prohibit the disclosure of such
            information to the Lenders, and the Lenders acknowledge (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to acknowledge) that, in such circumstances (and in the absence of a waiver of such
            confidentiality obligations, which waiver such Lender will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain), such Lender shall not be under any obligation to provide such information to them.
 
15.11      Hypothecary Representative (Quebec).  Without limiting the powers of the  Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, to
            the extent necessary for the purposes of holding any Loan Document granted by any Loan Party pursuant to the laws of the Province of Québec, each of the secured parties under any Loan Document and each Bank Product Provider (collectively, the
            “Secured Parties”) hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent, as part of its duties as Agent, to act as the hypothecary representative of all present and future Secured Parties as contemplated under Article 2692 of the Civil Code of
            Quebec.  Any Person who becomes a Secured Party or successor Agent shall be deemed to have consented to and ratified the foregoing appointment of the Agent as the hypothecary representative on behalf of all Secured Parties, including such
            Person and any Affiliate of such Person designated above as a Secured Party. The appointment of a successor Agent pursuant to the terms hereof also constitutes the appointment of a successor hypothecary representative under this Section without
            any further agreement, act or formality (subject to, prior to the successor hypothecary representative exercising the rights relating to the hypothec created under any such Loan Document, the publication by registration of a notice of
            replacement in the applicable registers in accordance with the terms of Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Quebec).  For greater certainty, the Agent, acting as hypothecary representative, will have the same rights, powers, immunities,
            indemnities and exclusions from liability as are prescribed in favor of the Agent in this Agreement, which will apply mutatis mutandis.

15.12      Collateral Matters.
 
(a)         The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to authorize) Agent to release any Lien on any
            Collateral (i) upon the termination of the Commitments and payment and satisfaction in full by the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries of all of the Obligations, (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed of if a release is required or
            desirable in connection therewith and if Borrowers certify to Agent that the sale or disposition is permitted under Section 6.4 (and Agent may rely conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry), (iii) constituting
            property in which no Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries owned any interest at the time Agent’s Lien was granted nor at any time thereafter, (iv) constituting property leased or licensed to a Loan Party or its Subsidiaries under a lease or
            license that has expired or is terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement, (v) in connection with a credit bid or purchase authorized under this Section 15.12, or (vi) constituting property owned by an Unrestricted
            Subsidiary upon designation of any Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary.  The Loan Parties and the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to authorize)
            Agent, based upon the instruction of the Required Lenders, to (a) consent to the sale of, credit bid, or purchase (either directly or indirectly through one or more entities) all or any portion of the Collateral at any sale thereof conducted
            under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of other applicable laws, (b) credit bid or purchase (either directly or indirectly through one or more entities) all or any
            portion of the Collateral at any sale or other disposition thereof conducted under the provisions of the Code, including pursuant to Sections 9-610 or 9-620 of the Code and comparable provisions of other applicable laws, or (c) credit bid or
            purchase (either directly or indirectly through one or more entities) all or any portion of the Collateral at any other sale or foreclosure conducted or consented to by Agent in accordance with applicable law in any judicial action or
            proceeding or by the exercise of any legal or equitable remedy.  In connection with any such credit bid or purchase, (i) the Obligations owed to the Lenders and the Bank Product Providers shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid on a
            ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims being estimated for such purpose if the fixing or liquidation thereof would not impair or unduly delay the ability of Agent to credit bid or purchase at such sale
            or other disposition of the Collateral and, if such contingent or unliquidated claims cannot be estimated without impairing or unduly delaying the ability of Agent to credit bid at such sale or other disposition, then such claims shall be
            disregarded, not credit bid, and not entitled to any interest in the Collateral that is the subject of such credit bid or purchase) and the Lenders and the Bank Product Providers whose Obligations are credit bid shall be entitled to receive
            interests (ratably based upon the proportion of their Obligations credit bid in relation to the aggregate amount of Obligations so credit bid) in the Collateral that is the subject of such credit bid or purchase (or in the Equity Interests of
            the any entities that are used to consummate such credit bid or purchase), and (ii) Agent, based upon the instruction of the Required Lenders, may accept non-cash consideration, including debt and equity securities issued by any entities used
            to consummate such credit bid or purchase and in connection therewith Agent may reduce the Obligations owed to the Lenders and the Bank Product Providers (ratably based upon the proportion of their Obligations credit bid in relation to the
            aggregate amount of Obligations so credit bid) based upon the value of such non-cash consideration; provided, that Bank Product Obligations not entitled to the application set forth in subclause (J) of Section 2.4(b)(iii) or (iv),
            as applicable, shall not be entitled to be, and shall not be, credit bid, or used in the calculation of the ratable interest of the Lenders and Bank Product Providers in the Obligations which are credit bid.  Except as provided above, Agent
            will not execute and deliver a release of any Lien on any Collateral without the prior written authorization of (y) if the release is of all or substantially all of the Collateral, all of the Lenders (without requiring the authorization of the
            Bank Product Providers), or (z) otherwise, the Required Lenders (without requiring the authorization of the Bank Product Providers).  Upon request by Agent or Borrowers at any time, the Lenders will (and if so requested, the Bank Product
            Providers will) confirm in writing Agent’s authority to release any such Liens on particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 15.12; provided, that (1) anything to the contrary contained in any of the Loan
            Documents notwithstanding, Agent shall not be required to execute any document or take any action necessary to evidence such release on terms that, in Agent’s opinion, could expose Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any
            consequence other than the release of such Lien without recourse, representation, or warranty, and (2) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly released) upon (or
            obligations of Borrowers in respect of) any and all interests retained by any Borrower, including, the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.  Each Lender further hereby irrevocably authorizes
            (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to irrevocably authorize) Agent, at its option and in its sole discretion, to subordinate (by contract or otherwise) any Lien granted to or held by Agent
            on any property under any Loan Document (a) to the holder of any Permitted Lien on such property if such Permitted Lien secures purchase money Indebtedness (including Capitalized Lease Obligations) which constitute Indebtedness permitted
            hereunder and (b) to the extent Agent has the authority under this Section 15.12 to release its Lien on such property.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 15.12, Agent shall be authorized, without the consent of any
            Lender and without the requirement that an asset sale consisting of the sale, transfer or other disposition having occurred, to release any security interest in any building, structure or improvement located in an area determined by the Federal
            Emergency Management Agency to have special flood hazards provided that such building, structure or improvement has an immaterial fair market value.
 

-177-

 

(b)          Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any of the Lenders (or the Bank Product Providers) (i) to verify or assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by a Loan Party or any
            of its Subsidiaries or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, (ii) to verify or assure that Agent’s Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, or enforced or are entitled to any
            particular priority, (iii) to verify or assure that any particular items of Collateral meet the eligibility criteria applicable in respect thereof, (iv) to impose, maintain, increase, reduce, implement, or eliminate any particular reserve
            hereunder or to determine whether the amount of any reserve is appropriate or not, or (v) to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights,
            authorities and powers granted or available to Agent pursuant to any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission, or event related thereto, subject to the terms and conditions
            contained herein, Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion given Agent’s own interest in the Collateral in its capacity as one of the Lenders and that Agent shall have no other duty or liability whatsoever to
            any Lender (or Bank Product Provider) as to any of the foregoing, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.
 
15.13      German Parallel Debt.
 
For purposes of taking security in, or subject to the laws of, Germany and ensuring the continued validity of such security, each of the Loan Parties agree:
 

-178-

 

(a)          As used in this Section 15.13, “Corresponding Obligations” means any German Obligation other than the Agent German Parallel Debt
            Claim.
 
(b)       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any Loan Document, each German Loan Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to pay to Agent, as a creditor in its
            own right and not as a representative of the Lenders, an amount (the “Agent German Parallel Debt Claim”) equal to each Corresponding Obligation owed by such German Loan Party by itself under the Loan
            Documents as and when such Corresponding Obligation is due and payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or would be due and payable but for any discharge resulting from any failure of a Lender to take appropriate steps, in
            insolvency or similar proceedings affecting such Loan Party, to preserve its entitlement to be paid such Corresponding Obligation.
 
(c)          Agent shall have its own independent right to demand and enforce payment of Agent German Parallel Debt Claim from a German Loan Party, irrespective of any discharge of such German
            Loan Party’s obligation to pay Agent German Parallel Debt Claim resulting from failure by Agent to take appropriate steps, in insolvency or similar proceedings affecting such German Loan Party, to preserve its entitlement to be paid such Agent
            German Parallel Debt Claim. Agent’s right to enforce Agent Parallel Debt Claim includes, without limitation, the exercise of any remedy available to Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, in law or in equity.
 
(d)         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) any amount due and payable by a German Loan Party to Agent in respect of Agent German Parallel Debt Claim shall be
            reduced if and to the extent the Lenders shall have irrevocably received payment in full of the corresponding amount in respect of the Corresponding Obligations; (ii) any amount due and payable by a German Loan Party to a Lender in respect of a
            Corresponding Obligation shall be reduced if and to the extent that Agent has irrevocably received payment in full of the corresponding amount in respect of Agent German Parallel Debt Claim; and (iii) the aggregate amount of Agent German
            Parallel Debt Claims shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Corresponding Obligations at any time.
 
(e)          Subject to the limitation set forth in clause (d) above, the rights of the Lenders to demand, receive and enforce payment of amounts payable by any German Loan Party in
            respect of the Corresponding Obligations are several, separate and independent from, and without prejudice to, the rights of Agent to demand, receive and enforce payment of Agent German Parallel Debt Claim in its own name.
 
(f)          Each Lender shall, at the request of Agent, perform any act required in connection with the enforcement of any Agent German Parallel Debt Claim, including, without limitation,
            joining in any legal proceedings in respect of Agent German Parallel Debt Claim or the German Collateral.
 
(g)          Each German Loan Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to require a Lender to join with Agent in any legal proceedings as co-claimant with Agent
            in respect of any Agent German Parallel Debt Claim or the German Collateral.
 
15.14      German Transaction Security
 
(a)          The Agent shall administer any security interest under a German Security Agreement which is pledged (Verpfändung) or otherwise transferred to
            any Loan Party under an accessory security right (akzessorische Sicherheit) as agent and security trustee (Treuhänder).
 

-179-

 

(b)          Each Loan Party (other than the Agent) hereby authorises the Agent (whether or not by or through employees or agents):
 




(i)

to exercise such rights, remedies, powers and discretions as are specifically delegated to or conferred upon the Agent under the German Security Agreements together with such powers and discretions as are reasonably incidental
                    thereto;



 




(ii)

to take such action on its behalf as may from time to time be authorised under or in accordance with the German Security Agreements; and



 




(iii)

to accept and enter into as its attorney (Stellvertreter) any pledge or other creation of any accessory security right granted in favour of such Loan Party in connection with the Loan Documents
                    under German law and to agree to and execute on its behalf as its attorney (Stellvertreter) any amendments, confirmations and/or alterations to any German Security Agreements which creates a
                    pledge or any other accessory security right (akzessorische Sicherheit) including the release or confirmation of release of such security interest.



 
(c)          Each of the Loan Parties (other than the Agent) hereby relieves the Agent from the restrictions pursuant to section 181 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches

              Gesetzbuch) and similar restrictions applicable to it pursuant to any other applicable law, in each case to the extent legally possible to such Loan Party. A Loan Party which is barred by its constitutional documents or by-laws from
            granting such exemption shall notify the Agent accordingly.
 
(d)          Each Loan Party (other than the Agent) hereby ratifies and approves all acts and declarations previously done by the Agent on such Loan Party’s behalf (including for the avoidance
            of doubt any declarations made by the Agent as representative without power of attorney (Vertreter ohne Vertretungsmacht) in relation to the creation of any pledge (Pfandrecht)
            on behalf and for the benefit of any Loan Party as future pledgee or otherwise).
 
(e)          Each of the Loan Parties (other than the Agent) hereby authorises the Agent to (sub-) delegate any powers granted to it under this Clause 15.14 to any attorney it may elect in its
            discretion and to grant powers of attorney to any such attorney (including the exemption from self-dealing and representing several persons (in particular from the restrictions of section 181 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch)) (in each case to the extent legally possible)).
 
15.15      Restrictions on Actions by Lenders; Sharing of Payments.
 
(a)          Each of the Lenders agrees that it shall not, without the express written consent of Agent, and that it shall, to the extent it is lawfully entitled to do so, upon the written
            request of Agent, set off against the Obligations, any amounts owing by such Lender to any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries or any deposit accounts of any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries now or hereafter maintained with such Lender.  Each of the
            Lenders further agrees that it shall not, unless specifically requested to do so in writing by Agent, take or cause to be taken any action, including, the commencement of any legal or equitable proceedings to enforce any Loan Document against
            any Borrower or any Guarantor or to foreclose any Lien on, or otherwise enforce any security interest in, any of the Collateral.
 

-180-

 

(b)         If, at any time or times any Lender shall receive (i) by payment, foreclosure, setoff, or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any payments with respect to the Obligations,
            except for any such proceeds or payments received by such Lender from Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) payments from Agent in excess of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of all such distributions by Agent, such Lender promptly
            shall (A) turn the same over to Agent, in kind, and with such endorsements as may be required to negotiate the same to Agent, or in immediately available funds, as applicable, for the account of all of the Lenders and for application to the
            Obligations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement, or (B) purchase, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in the Obligations owed to the other Lenders so that such excess payment received
            shall be applied ratably as among the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares; provided, that to the extent that such excess payment received by the purchasing party is thereafter recovered from it, those purchases of
            participations shall be rescinded in whole or in part, as applicable, and the applicable portion of the purchase price paid therefor shall be returned to such purchasing party, but without interest except to the extent that such purchasing
            party is required to pay interest in connection with the recovery of the excess payment.
 
15.16     Agency for Perfection.  Agent hereby appoints each other Lender (and each Bank Product Provider)
            as its agent (and each Lender hereby accepts (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to accept) such appointment) for the purpose of perfecting Agent’s Liens in assets which, in accordance with
            Article 8 or Article 9, as applicable, of the Code can be perfected by possession or control.  Should any Lender obtain possession or control of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify Agent thereof, and, promptly upon Agent’s request
            therefor shall deliver possession or control of such Collateral to Agent or in accordance with Agent’s instructions.
 
15.17     Payments by Agent to the Lenders.  All payments to be made by Agent to the Lenders (or Bank
            Product Providers) shall be made by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to such wire transfer instructions as each party may designate for itself by written notice to Agent.  Concurrently with each such payment, Agent
            shall identify whether such payment (or any portion thereof) represents principal, premium, fees, or interest of the Obligations.
 
15.18     Concerning the Collateral and Related Loan Documents.  Each member of the Lender Group authorizes
            and directs Agent to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Each member of the Lender Group agrees (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to agree) that any action taken by
            Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents relating to the Collateral and the exercise by Agent of its powers set forth therein or herein, together with such other powers that are reasonably incidental
            thereto, shall be binding upon all of the Lenders (and such Bank Product Provider).
 
15.19    Field Examination Reports; Confidentiality; Disclaimers by Lenders; Other Reports and Information.  By becoming a party to this Agreement,
            each Lender:
 
(a)        is deemed to have requested that Agent furnish such Lender, promptly after it becomes available, a copy of each field examination report respecting any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries
            (each, a “Report”) prepared by or at the request of Agent, and Agent shall so furnish each Lender with such Reports,
 
(b)          expressly agrees and acknowledges that Agent does not (i) make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any Report, and (ii) shall not be liable for any information
            contained in any Report,
 

-181-

 

(c)         expressly agrees and acknowledges that the Reports are not comprehensive audits or examinations, that Agent or other party performing any field examination will inspect only specific
            information regarding the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries and will rely significantly upon the Borrowers’ and their Subsidiaries’ books and records, as well as on representations of Borrowers’ personnel,
 
(d)        agrees to keep all Reports and other material, non-public information regarding the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries and their operations, assets, and existing and contemplated
            business plans in a confidential manner in accordance with Section 17.9, and
 
(e)         without limiting the generality of any other indemnification provision contained in this Agreement, agrees:  (i) to hold Agent and any other Lender preparing a Report harmless from
            any action the indemnifying Lender may take or fail to take or any conclusion the indemnifying Lender may reach or draw from any Report in connection with any loans or other credit accommodations that the indemnifying Lender has made or may
            make to Borrowers, or the indemnifying Lender’s participation in, or the indemnifying Lender’s purchase of, a loan or loans of Borrowers, and (ii) to pay and protect, and indemnify, defend and hold Agent, and any such other Lender preparing a
            Report harmless from and against, the claims, actions, proceedings, damages, costs, expenses, and other amounts (including, attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by Agent and any such other Lender preparing a Report as the direct or indirect
            result of any third parties who might obtain all or part of any Report through the indemnifying Lender.
 
In addition to the foregoing, (x) any Lender may from time to time request of Agent in writing that Agent provide to such Lender a copy of any report or document provided by any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries to
            Agent that has not been contemporaneously provided by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary to such Lender, and, upon receipt of such request, Agent promptly shall provide a copy of same to such Lender, (y) to the extent that Agent is entitled,
            under any provision of the Loan Documents, to request additional reports or information from any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries, any Lender may, from time to time, reasonably request Agent to exercise such right as specified in such Lender’s
            notice to Agent, whereupon Agent promptly shall request of Borrowers the additional reports or information reasonably specified by such Lender, and, upon receipt thereof from such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, Agent promptly shall provide a
            copy of same to such Lender, and (z) any time that Agent renders to Borrowers a statement regarding the Loan Account, Agent shall send a copy of such statement to each Lender.
 
15.20      Several Obligations; No Liability.  Notwithstanding that certain of the Loan Documents now or
            hereafter may have been or will be executed only by or in favor of Agent in its capacity as such, and not by or in favor of the Lenders, any and all obligations on the part of Agent (if any) to make any credit available hereunder shall
            constitute the several (and not joint) obligations of the respective Lenders on a ratable basis, according to their respective Commitments, to make an amount of such credit not to exceed, in principal amount, at any one time outstanding, the
            amount of their respective Commitments.  Nothing contained herein shall confer upon any Lender any interest in, or subject any Lender to any liability for, or in respect of, the business, assets, profits, losses, or liabilities of any other
            Lender.  Each Lender shall be solely responsible for notifying its Participants of any matters relating to the Loan Documents to the extent any such notice may be required, and no Lender shall have any obligation, duty, or liability to any
            Participant of any other Lender.  Except as provided in Section 15.7, no member of the Lender Group shall have any liability for the acts of any other member of the Lender Group.  No Lender shall be responsible to any Borrower or any
            other Person for any failure by any other Lender (or Bank Product Provider) to fulfill its obligations to make credit available hereunder, nor to advance for such Lender (or Bank Product Provider) or on its behalf, nor to take any other action
            on behalf of such Lender (or Bank Product Provider) hereunder or in connection with the financing contemplated herein.
 

-182-

 

15.21     Lead Arranger and Bookrunner.  The Lead Arrangers and the Bookrunners, in such capacities, shall not have any right, power, obligation,
            liability, responsibility, or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to it in its capacity as a Lender, as Agent, as a Swing Lender, or as Issuing Bank.  Without limiting the foregoing, each of Lead Arranger and the Bookrunner in
            such capacities, shall not have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or any Loan Party.  Each Lender, Agent, a Swing Lender, Issuing Bank, and each Loan Party acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on
            Lead Arrangers and the Bookrunners in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.  Each of Lead Arranger and Bookrunner in such capacities, shall be entitled to resign at any time by giving notice to Agent
            and Borrowers.
 
16.         WITHHOLDING TAXES.
 
16.1      Payments.  All payments made by any Loan Party under any Loan Document will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or
            withholding for, any Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable law, and in the event any deduction or withholding of Taxes is required, the applicable Loan Party shall make the required deduction or withholding, promptly pay over to the
            applicable Governmental Authority the tax deducted or withheld, and furnish to Agent as promptly as possible after the date the payment of any such Tax is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of tax receipts, if any, issued by such
            Governmental Authority evidencing such payment by the Loan Parties, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment that is reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.  Furthermore, if any such Tax is an Indemnified Tax,
            the Loan Parties agree to pay such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of all amounts due under this Agreement, any note, or Loan Document (including the payment of any additional amounts paid pursuant to this Section

              16.1 after deduction or withholding for or on account of any Indemnified Taxes on such additional amounts) will not be less than the amount the recipient thereof would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made or
            required.  The Loan Parties will promptly pay any Other Taxes or reimburse Agent for such Other Taxes upon Agent’s demand.  The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Indemnified Person (as defined in Section 10.3)
            (collectively a “Tax Indemnitee”) for the full amount of Indemnified Taxes arising in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or breach thereof by any Loan Party (including any Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on,
            or attributable to, additional amounts payable under this Section 16) imposed on, or paid by, such Tax Indemnitee and all reasonable costs and expenses related thereto (including fees and disbursements of attorneys and other tax
            professionals), as and when they are incurred and irrespective of whether suit is brought, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority (other than Indemnified Taxes
            and additional amounts that a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Tax Indemnitee).  The obligations of the Loan Parties under this Section 16 shall
            survive the termination of this Agreement, the resignation and replacement of Agent, and the repayment of the Obligations.
 
16.2        Exemptions.
 
(a)         If a Lender or Participant is entitled to claim an exemption or reduction from United States withholding tax, such Lender or Participant agrees with and in favor of Agent and
            Borrowers, to deliver to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) and the Administrative Borrower on behalf of all Borrowers one of the following before receiving its first payment under this
            Agreement:
 

-183-

 

(i)         if such Lender or Participant is entitled to claim an exemption from United States withholding tax pursuant to the portfolio interest exception, (A) a statement of the Lender or
            Participant, signed under penalty of perjury, that it is not a (I) a “bank” as described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the IRC, (II) a 10% shareholder of any Borrower (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the IRC), or (III) a controlled
            foreign corporation related to Borrowers within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the IRC, and (B) a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY (with proper attachments as applicable);
 
(ii)         if such Lender or Participant is entitled to claim an exemption from, or a reduction of, withholding tax under a United States tax treaty, a properly completed and executed copy of
            IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable;
 
(iii)        if such Lender or Participant is entitled to claim that interest paid under this Agreement is exempt from United States withholding tax because it is effectively connected with a
            United States trade or business of such Lender, a properly completed and executed copy of IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
(iv)        if such Lender or Participant is entitled to claim that interest paid under this Agreement is exempt from United States withholding tax because such Lender or Participant serves as
            an intermediary, a properly completed and executed copy of IRS Form W-8IMY (including a withholding statement and copies of the tax certification documentation for its beneficial owner(s) of the income paid to the intermediary, if required
            based on its status provided on the Form W-8IMY); or
 
(v)         a properly completed and executed copy of any other form or forms, including IRS Form W-9, as may be required under the IRC or other laws of the United States as a condition to
            exemption from, or reduction of, United States withholding or backup withholding tax.
 
(b)          Each Lender or Participant shall provide new forms (or successor forms) upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered forms and promptly notify Agent and
            Administrative Borrower (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.
 
(c)          If a Lender or Participant claims an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax in a jurisdiction other than the United States, such Lender or such Participant agrees with and
            in favor of Agent and Borrowers, to deliver to Agent and Administrative Borrower (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) any such form or forms, as may be required under the laws of such jurisdiction as
            a condition to exemption from, or reduction of, foreign withholding or backup withholding tax before receiving its first payment under this Agreement (including, if requested, Canada Revenue Agency Forms NR-301, NR-302 or NR-303, as
            applicable), but only if such Lender or such Participant is legally able to deliver such forms, or the providing of or delivery of such forms in the Lender’s reasonable judgment would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or
            expense or materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender (or its Affiliates); provided, further, that nothing in this Section 16.2(c) shall require a Lender or Participant to disclose any
            information that it deems to be confidential (including its tax returns).  Each Lender and each Participant shall provide new forms (or successor forms) upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered forms and promptly notify
            Agent and Administrative Borrower (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.
 

-184-

 

(d)        If a Lender or Participant claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax and such Lender or Participant sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all
            or part of the Obligations of Borrowers to such Lender or Participant, such Lender or Participant agrees to notify Agent and Administrative Borrower (or, in the case of a sale of a participation interest, to the Lender granting the
            participation only) of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner of Obligations of Borrowers to such Lender or Participant.  To the extent of such percentage amount, Agent and Administrative Borrower will treat such
            Lender’s or such Participant’s documentation provided pursuant to Section 16.2(a) or 16.2(c) as no longer valid.  With respect to such percentage amount, such Participant or Assignee may provide new documentation, pursuant to Section

              16.2(a) or 16.2(c), if applicable.  Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of this Section 16 with respect to its participation in any portion of the Commitments and the Obligations so long
            as such Participant complies with the obligations set forth in this Section 16 with respect thereto.
 
(e)          If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable due
            diligence and reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the IRC, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation
            only) at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, the Lender granting the participation) such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as
            prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the IRC) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, the Lender granting the participation) as may be necessary for Agent or Borrowers to comply
            with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (e), “FATCA”
            shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
16.3        Reductions.
 
(a)       If a Lender or a Participant is subject to an applicable withholding tax, Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, the Lender granting the participation) may withhold from any payment
            to such Lender or such Participant an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.  If the forms or other documentation required by Section 16.2(a) or 16.2(c) are not delivered to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant,
            the Lender granting the participation), then Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, the Lender granting the participation) may withhold from any payment to such Lender or such Participant not providing such forms or other documentation an
            amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.
 
(b)        If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the
            participation) did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender or any Participant due to a failure on the part of the Lender or any Participant (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not
            properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify Agent (or such Participant failed to notify the Lender granting the participation) of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax
            ineffective, or for any other reason) such Lender shall indemnify and hold Agent harmless (or, in the case of a Participant, such Participant shall indemnify and hold the Lender granting the participation harmless) for all amounts paid,
            directly or indirectly, by Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, by the Lender granting the participation), as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to
            Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) under this Section 16, together with all costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses).  The obligation of the Lenders and the
            Participants under this subsection shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of Agent.

16.4        Refunds.  If Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes (including
            any Tax credit from the taxing jurisdiction that previously imposed such Indemnified Taxes in lieu of a refund) in respect of which the Loan Parties have indemnified the Agent or such Lender or have paid additional amounts to the Agent or such
            Lender pursuant to this Section 16, then so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Agent or such Lender shall pay over such refund to the Administrative Borrower on behalf of the Loan Parties (but
            only to the extent of payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Loan Parties under this Section 16 with respect to Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such a refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of Agent or such Lender and
            without interest (other than any interest paid by the applicable Governmental Authority with respect to such a refund); provided, that the Loan Parties, upon the request of Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to
            the Loan Parties (plus any penalties, interest or other charges, imposed by the applicable Governmental Authority, other than such penalties, interest or other charges imposed as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Agent
            or Lender hereunder as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) to Agent or such Lender in the event Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything in this
            Agreement to the contrary, this Section 16 shall not be construed to require Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information which it deems confidential) to Loan Parties or any other Person or require
            Agent or any Lender to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to Section 16.4, the payment of which would place Agent or such Lender (or their Affiliates) in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Person would have
            been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.
 
16.5        VAT.
 
(a)          All amounts expressed to be payable under a Loan Document by any party to a Lender, Agent or the Lead Arrangers which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any
            supply for VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on that supply, and accordingly, subject to paragraph (b) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by a Lender, Agent or a Lead Arranger to any
            party under a Loan Document and a Lender, Agent or a Lead Arranger (as applicable) is required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, that party must pay to a Lender, Agent or a Lead Arranger (as applicable) (in addition to and
            at the same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of the VAT (and a Lender, Agent or a Lead Arranger (as applicable) must promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to that party).
 
(b)          If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by a Lender, Agent or a Lead Arranger (the “Supplier”) to any Lender, Agent or any Lead
            Arranger (the “Recipient”) under a Loan Document, and any party other than the Recipient (the “Relevant Party”) is required by the terms of any Loan Document to pay
            an amount equal to the consideration for that supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration):
 

-186-

 

(i)          (where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at the same time as paying that
            amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of the VAT.  The Recipient must (where this paragraph (i) applies) promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment the Recipient receives from the relevant tax
            authority which the Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply; and
 
(ii)        (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand from the Recipient, pay to the
            Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT.
 
(c)          Where a Loan Document requires any party to reimburse or indemnify a Lender, Agent or a Lead Arranger for any cost or expense, that party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case
            may be) such Lender, Agent or such Lead Arranger (as applicable) for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Lender, Agent or such Lead Arranger (as applicable)
            reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.
 
(d)          Any reference in this Clause 16.5 to any party shall, at any time when such party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the
            context otherwise requires) a reference to any relevant group member of such group at such time.
 
(e)          In relation to any supply made by a Lender, Agent or a Lead Arranger to any party under a Loan Document, if reasonably requested by such Lender, Agent or such  Lead Arranger, that
            party must promptly provide such Lender, Agent or such Lead Arranger with details of that party’s VAT registration and such other information as is reasonably requested by such Lender, Agent or the Lead Arranger in connection with its VAT
            reporting requirements in relation to such supply.
 
16.6        Additional United Kingdom Withholding Tax Matters.
 
(i) Subject to (ii) below, each Lender, each Participant and each UK Tax Borrower which makes a payment to such Lender or Participant shall cooperate in completing any procedural formalities
            necessary for such UK Tax Borrower to obtain authorization to make such payment without withholding or deduction for Taxes imposed under the laws of the United Kingdom.
 
(ii)
 
(A)  A Lender on the day on which this Agreement closes that holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme confirms that it wishes such scheme to apply to this Agreement and
            confirms its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence to each UK Tax Borrower and the Agent; and
 
(B)  a Lender which becomes a Lender hereunder, or Participant which becomes a Participant hereunder, after the day on which this Agreement closes that holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty
            Passport scheme shall confirm that it wishes such scheme to apply to this Agreement and shall provide its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence to each UK Tax Borrower and the Agent , and
 

-187-

 

(C) Upon satisfying either clause (A) or (B) above, such Lender or such Participant shall have satisfied its obligation under Section 16.6(i) above.
 
(iii)  If:
 
(A)  any UK Tax Borrower making a payment to such Lender or such Participant has not made a Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of such Lender or Participant; or
 
(B)  any UK Tax Borrower making a payment to such Lender or such Participant has made a Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of such Lender or such Participant but:
 
(1) such Borrower DTTP Filing has been rejected by HM Revenue & Customs; or
 
(2) HM Revenue & Customs has not given such UK Tax Borrower authority to make payments to such Lender without a deduction for tax within 60 days of the date of such Borrower DTTP Filing;
 
and in each case, such UK Tax Borrower has notified that Lender or Participant in writing of either (1) or (2) above,
 
then such Lender or such Participant and such UK Tax Borrower shall co-operate in completing any additional procedural formalities necessary for such UK Tax Borrower to obtain authorization to make that payment without withholding or
            deduction for Taxes imposed under the laws of the United Kingdom.
 
(iv)  If a Lender or Participant has not confirmed its scheme reference number and jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with Section 16.6(ii) above, no UK Tax Borrower shall make a Borrower DTTP Filing or
            file any other form relating to the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme in respect of that Lender’s Commitment(s) or its participation in any Loan unless the Lender or Participant otherwise agrees.
 
(v)  Each UK Tax Borrower shall, promptly on making a Borrower DTTP Filing, deliver a copy of such Borrower DTTP Filing to the Agent for delivery to the relevant Lender.
 
(vi)  Each Lender shall notify any UK Tax Borrower and the Agent if it ceases to be entitled to claim the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United Kingdom is a party with respect to
            payments made by any UK Tax Borrower hereunder.
 
17.          GENERAL PROVISIONS.
 
17.1       Effectiveness.  This Agreement shall be binding and deemed effective when executed by each
            Borrower, Agent, and each Lender whose signature is provided for on the signature pages hereof.
 
17.2       Section Headings.  Headings and numbers have been set forth herein for convenience only.  Unless
            the contrary is compelled by the context, everything contained in each Section applies equally to this entire Agreement.
 

-188-

 

17.3       Interpretation.  Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be
            construed against the Lender Group or any Borrower, whether under any rule of construction or otherwise.  On the contrary, this Agreement has been reviewed by all parties and shall be construed and interpreted according to the ordinary meaning
            of the words used so as to accomplish fairly the purposes and intentions of all parties hereto.
 
17.4       Severability of Provisions.  Each provision of this Agreement shall be severable from every
            other provision of this Agreement for the purpose of determining the legal enforceability of any specific provision.
 
17.5       Bank Product Providers.  Each Bank Product Provider in its capacity as such shall be deemed a
            third party beneficiary hereof and of the provisions of the other Loan Documents for purposes of any reference in a Loan Document to the parties for whom Agent is acting.  Agent hereby agrees to act as agent for such Bank Product Providers and,
            by virtue of entering into a Bank Product Agreement, the applicable Bank Product Provider shall be automatically deemed to have appointed Agent as its agent and to have accepted the benefits of the Loan Documents.  It is understood and agreed
            that the rights and benefits of each Bank Product Provider under the Loan Documents consist exclusively of such Bank Product Provider’s being a beneficiary of the Liens and security interests (and, if applicable, guarantees) granted to Agent
            and the right to share in payments and collections out of the Collateral as more fully set forth herein. In addition, each Bank Product Provider, by virtue of entering into a Bank Product Agreement, shall be automatically deemed to have agreed
            that Agent shall have the right, but shall have no obligation, to establish, maintain, relax, or release reserves in respect of the Bank Product Obligations and that if reserves are established there is no obligation on the part of Agent to
            determine or insure whether the amount of any such reserve is appropriate or not.  In connection with any such distribution of payments or proceeds of Collateral, Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due or owing to any Bank Product
            Provider unless such Bank Product Provider has provided a written certification (setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation) to Agent as to the amounts that are due and owing to it and such written certification is received by Agent a
            reasonable period of time prior to the making of such distribution.  Agent shall have no obligation to calculate the amount due and payable with respect to any Bank Products, but may rely upon the written certification of the amount due and
            payable from the applicable Bank Product Provider.  In the absence of an updated certification, Agent shall be entitled to assume that the amount due and payable to the applicable Bank Product Provider is the amount last certified to Agent by
            such Bank Product Provider as being due and payable (less any distributions made to such Bank Product Provider on account thereof).  Borrowers may obtain Bank Products from any Bank Product Provider, although Borrowers are not required to do
            so.  Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that no Bank Product Provider has committed to provide any Bank Products and that the providing of Bank Products by any Bank Product Provider is in the sole and absolute discretion of such Bank Product
            Provider.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, no provider or holder of any Bank Product shall have any voting or approval rights hereunder (or be deemed a Lender) solely by virtue of its
            status as the provider or holder of such agreements or products or the Obligations owing thereunder, nor shall the consent of any such provider or holder be required (other than in their capacities as Lenders, to the extent applicable) for any
            matter hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, including as to any matter relating to the Collateral or the release of Collateral or Guarantors.
 
17.6       Debtor-Creditor Relationship.  The relationship between the Lenders and Agent, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other hand,
            is solely that of creditor and debtor.  No member of the Lender Group has (or shall be deemed to have) any fiduciary relationship or duty to any Loan Party arising out of or in connection with the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated
            thereby, and there is no agency or joint venture relationship between the members of the Lender Group, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other hand, by virtue of any Loan Document or any transaction contemplated therein.
 

-189-

 

17.7      Counterparts; Electronic Execution.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts
            and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement.  Execution of any such
            counterpart may be by means of (a) an electronic signature that complies with the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, as in effect from time to time, state enactments of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, as
            in effect from time to time, or any other relevant and applicable electronic signatures law; (b) an original manual signature; or (c) a faxed, scanned, or photocopied manual signature. Each electronic signature or faxed, scanned, or photocopied
            manual signature shall for all purposes have the same validity, legal effect, and admissibility in evidence as an original manual signature.  Agent reserves the right, in its discretion, to accept, deny, or condition acceptance of any
            electronic signature on this Agreement.  Any party delivering an executed counterpart of this Agreement by faxed, scanned or photocopied manual signature shall also deliver an original manually executed counterpart, but the failure to deliver
            an original manually executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability and binding effect of this Agreement.  The foregoing shall apply to each other Loan Document, and any notice delivered hereunder or thereunder, mutatis mutandis.
 
17.8        Revival and Reinstatement of Obligations; Certain Waivers.
 
(a)        If any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider repays, refunds, restores, or returns in whole or in part, any payment or property (including any proceeds of
            Collateral) previously paid or transferred to such member of the Lender Group or such Bank Product Provider in full or partial satisfaction of any Obligation or on account of any other obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document or any
            Bank Product Agreement, because the payment, transfer, or the incurrence of the obligation so satisfied is asserted or declared to be void, voidable, or otherwise recoverable under any law relating to creditors’ rights, including provisions of
            the Bankruptcy Code relating to fraudulent transfers, preferences, or other voidable or recoverable obligations or transfers (each, a “Voidable Transfer”), or because such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider elects to do
            so on the reasonable advice of its counsel in connection with a claim that the payment, transfer, or incurrence is or may be a Voidable Transfer, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount thereof that such member of the Lender Group
            or Bank Product Provider elects to repay, restore, or return (including pursuant to a settlement of any claim in respect thereof), and as to all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees of such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product
            Provider related thereto, (i) the liability of the Loan Parties with respect to the amount or property paid, refunded, restored, or returned will automatically and immediately be revived, reinstated, and restored and will exist, and (ii)
            Agent’s Liens securing such liability shall be effective, revived, and remain in full force and effect, in each case, as fully as if such Voidable Transfer had never been made.  If, prior to any of the foregoing, (A) Agent’s Liens shall have
            been released or terminated, or (B) any provision of this Agreement shall have been terminated or cancelled, Agent’s Liens, or such provision of this Agreement, shall be reinstated in full force and effect and such prior release, termination,
            cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligation of any Loan Party in respect of such liability or any Collateral securing such liability. This provision shall survive the termination
            of this Agreement and the repayment in full of the Obligations.

17.9        Confidentiality.
 
(a)         Agent and Lenders each individually (and not jointly or jointly and severally) agree that material, non-public information regarding the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries, their
            operations, assets, and existing and contemplated business plans (“Confidential Information”) shall be treated by Agent and the Lenders in a confidential manner, and shall not be disclosed by Agent and the Lenders to Persons who are not
            parties to this Agreement, except: (i) to attorneys for and other advisors, accountants, auditors, and consultants to any member of the Lender Group and to employees, directors and officers of any member of the Lender Group (the Persons in this
            clause (i), “Lender Group Representatives”) on a “need to know” basis in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and on a confidential basis, (ii) to Subsidiaries and Affiliates of any member of the Lender
            Group (including the Bank Product Providers); provided, that any such Subsidiary or Affiliate shall have agreed to receive such information hereunder subject to the terms of this Section 17.9, (iii) as may be required by
            regulatory authorities so long as such authorities are informed of the confidential nature of such information, (iv) as may be required by statute, decision, or judicial or administrative order, rule, or regulation; provided, that (x)
            prior to any disclosure under this clause (iv), the disclosing party agrees to provide Borrowers with prior notice thereof, to the extent that it is practicable to do so and to the extent that the disclosing party is permitted to provide such
            prior notice to Borrowers pursuant to the terms of the applicable statute, decision, or judicial or administrative order, rule, or regulation and (y) any disclosure under this clause (iv) shall be limited to the portion of the Confidential
            Information as may be required by such statute, decision, or judicial or administrative order, rule, or regulation, (v) as may be agreed to in advance in writing by Borrowers, (vi) as requested or required by any Governmental Authority pursuant
            to any subpoena or other legal process; provided, that (x) prior to any disclosure under this clause (vi) the disclosing party agrees to provide Borrowers with prior written notice thereof, to the extent that it is practicable to do so
            and to the extent that the disclosing party is permitted to provide such prior written notice to Borrowers pursuant to the terms of the subpoena or other legal process and (y) any disclosure under this clause (vi) shall be limited to the
            portion of the Confidential Information as may be required by such Governmental Authority pursuant to such subpoena or other legal process, (vii) as to any such information that is or becomes generally available to the public (other than as a
            result of prohibited disclosure by Agent or the Lenders or the Lender Group Representatives), (viii) in connection with any assignment, participation or pledge of any Lender’s interest under this Agreement; provided, that prior to
            receipt of Confidential Information any such assignee, participant, or pledgee shall have agreed in writing to receive such Confidential Information either subject to the terms of this Section 17.9 or pursuant to confidentiality
            requirements substantially similar to those contained in this Section 17.9 (and such Person may disclose such Confidential Information to Persons employed or engaged by them as described in clause (i) above), (ix) in connection with any
            litigation or other adversary proceeding involving parties hereto which such litigation or adversary proceeding involves claims related to the rights or duties of such parties under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided,
            that prior to any disclosure to any Person (other than any Loan Party, Agent, any Lender, any of their respective Affiliates, or their respective counsel) under this clause (ix) with respect to litigation involving any Person (other than any
            Borrower, Agent, any Lender, any of their respective Affiliates, or their respective counsel), the disclosing party agrees to provide Borrowers with prior written notice thereof, and (x) in connection with, and to the extent reasonably
            necessary for, the exercise of any secured creditor remedy under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document.
 
(b)        Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Agent may disclose information concerning the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to loan
            syndication and pricing reporting services or in its marketing or promotional materials, with such information to consist of deal terms and other information customarily found in such publications or marketing or promotional materials and may
            otherwise use the name, logos, and other insignia of any Borrower or the other Loan Parties and the Commitments provided hereunder in any “tombstone” or other advertisements, on its website or in other marketing materials of Agent.
 

-191-

 

(c)          Each Loan Party agrees that Agent may make materials or information provided by or on behalf of Borrowers hereunder (collectively, “Borrower Materials”) available to the
            Lenders by posting the Communications on IntraLinks, SyndTrak or a substantially similar secure electronic transmission system (the “Platform”).  The Platform is provided “as is” and “as available.”  Agent does not warrant the accuracy
            or completeness of the Borrower Materials, or the adequacy of the Platform and expressly disclaim liability for errors or omissions in the communications.  No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including any warranty of
            merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by Agent in connection with the Borrower Materials or the Platform.  In no event shall Agent or any
            of the Agent-Related Persons have any liability to the Loan Parties, any Lender or any other person for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort,
            contract or otherwise) arising out of any Loan Party’s or Agent’s transmission of communications through the Internet, except to the extent the liability of such person is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
            jurisdiction to have resulted from such person’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Each Loan Party further agrees that certain of the Lenders may be “public-side” Lenders (i.e., Lenders that do not
            wish to receive material non-public information with respect to the Loan Parties or their securities) (each, a “Public Lender”).  The Loan Parties shall be deemed to have authorized Agent and its Affiliates and the Lenders to treat
            Borrower Materials marked “PUBLIC” or otherwise at any time filed with the SEC as not containing any material non-public information with respect to the Loan Parties or their securities for purposes of United States federal and state securities
            laws.  All Borrower Materials marked “PUBLIC” are permitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform designated as “Public Investor” (or another similar term).  Agent and its Affiliates and the Lenders shall be entitled to treat
            any Borrower Materials that are not marked “PUBLIC” or that are not at any time filed with the SEC as being suitable only for posting on a portion of the Platform not marked as “Public Investor” (or such other similar term).
 
17.10     Survival.  All representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and
            in the certificates or other instru-ments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and
            delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that Agent, Issuing Bank, or any Lender may have
            had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of, or any accrued interest
            on, any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstand-ing or unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or been terminated.
 
17.11      Patriot Act; Due Diligence.  Each Lender that is subject to the requirements of the Patriot Act
            hereby notifies the Loan Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of each Loan Party
            and other information that will allow such Lender to identify each Loan Party in accordance with the Patriot Act.  In addition, Agent and each Lender shall have the right to periodically conduct due diligence on all Loan Parties, their senior
            management and key principals and legal and beneficial owners including in relation to satisfaction of know-your-customer requirements whether as a result of the introduction of or any change in (or in the interpretation, administration or
            application of) any law or regulation made after the date of this Agreement, any change in the status of a Loan Party or any change in the composition of the shareholders of any Loan Party after the date of this Agreement or a proposed
            assignment or transfer by a Lender of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a party that is not a Lender prior to such assignment or transfer or otherwise..  Each Loan Party agrees to cooperate in respect of the conduct of
            such due diligence and further agrees that the reasonable costs and charges for any such due diligence by Agent shall constitute Lender Group Expenses hereunder and be for the account of Borrowers.
 

-192-

 

17.12     CAML.  Each Loan Party acknowledges that, pursuant to CAML the Agent and each Lender may be required to obtain, verify and record
            information regarding the Borrowers, the other Loan Parties and their respective directors, authorized signing officers and controlling direct or indirect shareholders, and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Loan Party shall promptly
            provide all such information, including supporting documentation and other evidence, as may be reasonably requested by the Agent or any Lender, or any prospective assignee or participant of a Lender, in order to comply with any applicable CAML,
            whether now or hereafter in existence. If the Agent has ascertained the identity of a Borrower or Loan Party or any authorized signatories of a Borrower or a Loan Party for the purposes of applicable CAML, then the Agent: (a) shall be deemed to
            have done so as an agent for each Lender, and this Agreement shall constitute a “written agreement” in such regard between each Lender and the Agent within the meaning of applicable CAML; and (b) shall provide to each Lender copies of all
            information obtained in such regard without any representation or warranty as to its accuracy or completeness. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence and except as may otherwise be agreed in writing, each of the Lenders agrees that the Agent
            has no obligation to ascertain the identity of the Borrower or any Loan Party or any authorized signatories of the Borrower or any Loan Party on behalf of any Lender, or to confirm the completeness or accuracy of any information it obtains from
            the Borrower or any Loan Party or any such authorized signatory in doing so.
 
17.13     Integration.  This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, reflects the entire
            understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not be contradicted or qualified by any other agreement, oral or written, before the date hereof.  The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, all
            Bank Product Agreements, if any, are independent agreements governed by the written provisions of such Bank Product Agreements, which will remain in full force and effect, unaffected by any repayment, prepayments, acceleration, reduction,
            increase, or change in the terms of any credit extended hereunder, except as otherwise expressly provided in such Bank Product Agreement.
 
17.14      Viavi Solutions, Inc. as Agent for Borrowers.  Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Viavi
            Solutions, Inc., as the borrowing agent and attorney-in-fact for all Borrowers (the “Administrative Borrower”) which appointment shall remain in full force and effect unless and until Agent shall have received prior written notice signed
            by each Borrower that such appointment has been revoked and that another Borrower has been appointed Administrative Borrower.  Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes Administrative Borrower (a) to provide Agent with all
            notices with respect to Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit obtained for the benefit of any Borrower and all other notices and instructions under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (and any notice or instruction provided by
            Administrative Borrower shall be deemed to be given by Borrowers hereunder and shall bind each Borrower), (b) to receive notices and instructions from members of the Lender Group (and any notice or instruction provided by any member of the
            Lender Group to Administrative Borrower in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been given to each Borrower), (c) to enter into Bank Product Provider Agreements on behalf of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, and (d) to take
            such action as Administrative Borrower deems appropriate on its behalf to obtain Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit and to exercise such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.  It is
            understood that the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral in a combined fashion, as more fully set forth herein, is done solely as an accommodation to Borrowers in order to utilize the collective borrowing powers of Borrowers in the most
            efficient and economical manner and at their request, and that Lender Group shall not incur liability to any Borrower as a result hereof.  Each Borrower expects to derive benefit, directly or indirectly, from the handling of the Loan Account
            and the Collateral in a combined fashion since the successful operation of each Borrower is dependent on the continued successful performance of the integrated group.  To induce the Lender Group to do so, and in consideration thereof, each
            Borrower hereby jointly and severally agrees to indemnify each member of the Lender Group and hold each member of the Lender Group harmless against any and all liability, expense, loss or claim of damage or injury, made against the Lender Group
            by any Borrower or by any third party whosoever, arising from or incurred by reason of (i) the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral of Borrowers as herein provided, or (ii) the Lender Group’s relying on any instructions of Administrative
            Borrower, except that Borrowers will have no liability to the relevant Agent-Related Person or Lender-Related Person under this Section 17.14 with respect to any liability that
            has been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent-Related Person or Lender-Related Person, as the case may be.

17.15     Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document
            or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured,
            may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
 
(a)          the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party
            hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and
 
(b)          the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
 
(i)       

 of any such liability;
 
(ii)          a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such the applicable Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or
            a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other
            Loan Document; or
 
(iii)        the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.
 

-194-

 

17.16      Judgment Currency.  If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other
            Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day or
            Eurocurrency Banking Day, as applicable, preceding that on which final judgment is given.  The obligation of Borrowers in respect of any such sum due from it to Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall,
            notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the “Agreement Currency”), be discharged only to
            the extent that on the Business Day or Eurocurrency Banking Day, as applicable, following receipt by Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, Agent or such Lender, as the case may be,
            may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to Agent or any Lender from Borrowers in the
            Agreement Currency, Borrowers agree, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than
            the sum originally due to Agent or any Lender in such Currency, Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to Borrowers (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under Applicable Law).
 
17.17    Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs.  To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise,
            for Hedge Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit Support” and each such QFC a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of
            the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special
              Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State
            of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States): In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution
            Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such
            QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and
            rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.  In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime,
            Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights
            could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.  Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and
            agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

17.18      Erroneous Payments.
 
(a)         Each Lender, each Issuing Bank, each other Bank Product Provider and any other party hereto hereby severally agrees that if (i) Agent notifies (which such notice shall be conclusive
            absent manifest error) such Lender or Issuing Bank or any Bank Product Provider (or the Lender which is an Affiliate of a Lender, Issuing Bank or Bank Product Provider) or any other Person that has received funds from Agent or any of its
            Affiliates, either for its own account or on behalf of a Lender, Issuing Bank or Bank Product Provider (each such recipient, a “Payment Recipient”) that Agent has determined in its sole discretion that any funds received by such Payment
            Recipient were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Payment Recipient) or (ii) any Payment Recipient receives any payment from Agent (or any of its
            Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, as
            applicable, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, as applicable, or (z) that such Payment
            Recipient otherwise becomes aware was transmitted or received in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) then, in each case, an error in payment shall be presumed to have been made (any such amounts specified in clauses (i) or (ii) of this Section

              17.18(a), whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise; individually and collectively, an “Erroneous Payment”), then, in each case, such Payment Recipient is deemed
            to have knowledge of such error at the time of its receipt of such Erroneous Payment; provided that nothing in this Section shall require Agent to provide any of the notices specified in clauses (i) or (ii) above. Each Payment Recipient agrees
            that it shall not assert any right or claim to any Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by Agent for the return of any
            Erroneous Payments, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine.
 
(b)          Without limiting the immediately preceding clause (a), each Payment Recipient agrees that, in the case of clause (a)(ii) above, it shall promptly notify Agent in writing of
            such occurrence.
 
(c)        In the case of either clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of Agent and shall be segregated by the Payment Recipient and held
            in trust for the benefit of Agent, and upon demand from Agent such Payment Recipient shall (or, shall cause any Person who received any portion of an Erroneous Payment on its behalf to), promptly, but in all events no later than one Business
            Day (or such later date as Agent may agree in its sole discretion) thereafter, return to Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds and in the currency so received,
            together with interest thereon (except to the extent waived in writing) in respect of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to
            Agent at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect.
 
(d)        In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause
            (c), from any Lender that is a Payment Recipient or an Affiliate of a Payment Recipient (such unrecovered amount as to such Lender, an “Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency”), then at the sole discretion of Agent and upon Agent’s written
            notice to such Lender (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have made a cashless assignment of the full face amount of the portion of its Loans (but not its Commitments) with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the “Erroneous
              Payment Impacted Loans”) to Agent or, at the option of Agent, Agent’s applicable lending affiliate (such assignee, the “Agent Assignee”) in an amount that is equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount
            as Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Loans (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Loans, the “Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment”) plus any accrued and unpaid interest on such assigned amount, without
            further consent or approval of any party hereto and without any payment by Agent Assignee as the assignee of such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment.  Without limitation of its rights hereunder, following the effectiveness of the Erroneous
            Payment Deficiency Assignment, Agent may make a cashless reassignment to the applicable assigning Lender of any Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment at any time by written notice to the applicable assigning Lender and upon such reassignment
            all of the Loans assigned pursuant to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment shall be reassigned to such Lender without any requirement for payment or other consideration.  The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (1) any assignment
            contemplated in this clause (d) shall be made without any requirement for any payment or other consideration paid by the applicable assignee or received by the assignor and (2) the provisions of this clause (d) shall govern in the event of any
            conflict with the terms and conditions of Section 13.
 

-196-

 

(e)          Each party hereto hereby agrees that (x) in the event an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered from any Payment Recipient that has received such Erroneous Payment
            (or portion thereof) for any reason, Agent (1) shall be subrogated to all the rights of such Payment Recipient and (2) is authorized to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Payment Recipient under any Loan
            Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by Agent to such Payment Recipient from any source, against any amount due to Agent under this Section 17.18 or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement, (y) the receipt of
            an Erroneous Payment by a Payment Recipient shall not for the purpose of this Agreement be treated as a payment, prepayment, repayment, discharge or other satisfaction of any Obligations owed by Borrowers or any other Loan Party, except, in
            each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by Agent from Borrowers or any other Loan Party for the purpose of making for a payment on
            the Obligations and (z) to the extent that an Erroneous Payment was in any way or at any time credited as payment or satisfaction of any of the Obligations, the Obligations or any part thereof that were so credited, and all rights of the
            Payment Recipient, as the case may be, shall be reinstated and continue in full force and effect as if such payment or satisfaction had never been received.
 
(f)          Each party’s obligations under this Section 17.18 shall survive the resignation or replacement of Agent or any transfer of right or obligations by, or the replacement of, a
            Lender, the termination of the Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.
 
(g)         The provisions of this Section 17.18 to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this Section 17.18 will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party
            hereunder arising from any Payment Recipient’s receipt of an Erroneous Payment and (ii) there will only be deemed to be a recovery of the Erroneous Payment to the extent that Agent has received payment from the Payment Recipient in immediately
            available funds the Erroneous Payment Return, whether directly from the Payment Recipient, as a result of the exercise by Agent of its rights of subrogation or set off as set forth above in clause (e) or as a result of the receipt by Agent
            Assignee of a payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Loans assigned to Agent Assignee pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, but excluding any other amounts in respect thereof (it being agreed that any payments of
            interest, fees, expenses or other amounts (other than principal) received by Agent Assignee in respect of the Loans assigned to Agent Assignee pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment shall be the sole property of Agent Assignee
            and shall not constitute a recovery of the Erroneous Payment).
 
17.19      Certain ERISA Matters.
 
(a)         Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the
            date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Agent, the Lead Arrangers and their respective Affiliates, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, that at
            least one of the following is and will be true:
 
(i)         such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans with respect to such Lender’s entrance into,
            participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit or the Commitments or this Agreement;
 

-197-

 

(ii)         the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as PTE 84-14 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset
            managers), PTE 95-60 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTE 91-38 (a class
            exemption for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds) or PTE 96-23 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect to such Lender’s entrance into,
            participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement;
 
(iii)       (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager
            made the investment decision on behalf of such Lender to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of and
            performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84-14 and (D) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection
            (a) of Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement; or
 
(iv)        such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Agent, in its sole discretion, and such Lender.
 
(b)          In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has provided another representation, warranty
            and covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person
            became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Agent, each Arranger and their respective Affiliates, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrowers
            or any other Loan Party, that none of the Agent, the Lead Arrangers and their respective Affiliates is a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and
            performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or
            thereto).
 
17.20      Applicable Designees.  Agent, Issuing Bank, each Swing Lender and each Borrower hereby agree that each Lender at its option may make any Revolving Loan
            (including purchasing participations in any Letter of Credit and Letter of Credit Exposure) and each Issuing Bank may issue any Letter of Credit, in each case, by causing any domestic or foreign office, branch or Affiliate of such Lender or
            Issuing Bank (each, an “Applicable Designee”) to make such Revolving Loan (including purchasing participations in any Letter of Credit and Letter of Credit Exposure) or issue such Letter of Credit, as applicable; provided that any
            exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Furthermore, with respect to (a) each provision of this Agreement relating to the funding or
            participation in any Revolving Loans or the repayment or the reimbursement thereof by a Borrower in connection therewith, (b) any rights of set-off, (c) any rights of indemnification or expense reimbursement, and (d) reserves, capital adequacy
            or other provisions, each reference to Agent or a Lender shall be deemed to include Agent’s or such Lender’s Applicable Designee. Notwithstanding the designation by Agent or any Lender of an Applicable Designee, Borrowers, Agent and the Lenders
            shall deal solely and directly with Agent or such Lender in connection with Agent’s or such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement; provided that each Applicable Designee shall be subject to the provisions obligating or
            restricting Agent or Lenders, as applicable, under this Agreement.
