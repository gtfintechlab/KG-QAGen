(b)                                 Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section 2.06 and may, in reliance on such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on written demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Term Loans.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
 
SECTION 2.07.                                                     Interest Elections.  (a)  Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in the applicable Borrowing Request or as otherwise provided in Section 2.03.  Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such
 
48





 
Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.07.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
 
(b)                                 To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.07, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Term Loan Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election (it being understood and agreed that such an election may be made prior to the Closing Date).  Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall, to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent, be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or facsimile to the Administrative Agent of an executed written Interest Election Request.  Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
 
(i)                                     the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
 
(ii)                                  the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(iii)                               whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
 
(iv)                              if the resulting Borrowing is to be a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period.
 
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.
 
(c)                                  Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request in accordance with this Section 2.07, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing.
 
(d)                                 If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of
 
49





 
such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing for an additional Interest Period of one month.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Borrower, then, so long as such Event of Default is continuing, (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
 
SECTION 2.08.                                                     Termination and Reduction of Commitments.  (a)  Unless previously terminated, the Initial Term Loan Commitments shall automatically terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the earliest of (x) the Long Stop Date, (y) the Certain Funds Termination Date and (z) the date on which all of the Certain Funds Purposes have been achieved without the making of any Initial Term Loans.  In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds are received by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of any Prepayment Event during the Certain Funds Period, the Borrower or any such Subsidiary shall deposit such Net Proceeds in an Escrow Account within one Business Day after the receipt of such Net Proceeds, and upon such deposit, the Commitments shall be reduced in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the amount of such Net Proceeds.
 
(b)                                 The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time permanently reduce, the Commitments; provided that each partial reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000.
 
(c)                                  The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section 2.08 at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be irrevocable.  Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent.  Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
 
SECTION 2.09.                                                     Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.  (a)  The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Initial Term Loan of such Lender on the Term Maturity Date.
 
(b)                                 The records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be prima facie evidence (absent manifest error) of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower in respect of Loans, interest and fees due or accrued hereunder; provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay any amounts due hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
50





 
(c)                                  Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or to such payee and its registered assigns) to the extent requested and required by such Lender.
 
SECTION 2.10.                                                     [Reserved].
 
SECTION 2.11.                                                     Prepayment of Loans.  (a)    The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to the requirements of this Section 2.11.
 
(b)                                 [Reserved].
 
(c)                                  In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds (other than from Excluded Sources)  are received by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of any Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall, not later than the fifth Business Day following the day such Net Proceeds are received, prepay Term Loan Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the amount of such Net Proceeds;
 
(d)                                 [Reserved].
 
(e)                                  Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Borrowings under this Section 2.11, the Borrower shall, subject to the next sentence, specify the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid in the notice of such prepayment delivered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section 2.11.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Term Lender may elect, by notice to the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by hand delivery or facsimile) at least one Business Day (or such shorter period as may be established by the Administrative Agent) prior to the required prepayment date, to decline all or any portion of any prepayment of its Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.11 (other than an optional prepayment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 2.11, which may not be declined), in which case the aggregate amount of the payment that would have been applied to prepay Term Loans but was so declined shall be retained by the Borrower.
 
(f)                                   The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by hand delivery or facsimile) of any optional prepayment and, to the extent practicable, any mandatory prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., Local Time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., Local Time, one Business Day (or two Business Days, in the case of a mandatory prepayment) before the date of prepayment.  Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each
 
51





 
Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment; provided that a notice of prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 2.11 may state that such notice is conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein, in which case such notice of prepayment may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified date of prepayment) if such condition is not satisfied.  Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment.  Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.  Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.
 
SECTION 2.12.                                                     Fees.
 
(a)                                 The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
 
(b)                                 All fees payable hereunder shall be paid in U.S. Dollars on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent.  Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
 
SECTION 2.13.                                                     Interest.  (a)  The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
 
(b)                                 The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
 
(c)                                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2.00% per annum plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 2.13 or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2.00% per annum plus the rate applicable to ABR Term Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.13.
 
(d)                                 Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 2.13 shall be payable on written demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii)
 
52





 
in the event of any conversion of a Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.  All interest shall be payable in the currency in which the applicable Loan is denominated.
 
(e)                                  All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable Alternate Base Rate and Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
SECTION 2.14.                                                     Alternate Rate of Interest.  If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing:
 
(a)                                 the Administrative Agent determines in good faith (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means (including by means of an Interpolated Rate) do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or
 
(b)                                 the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Eurocurrency Borrowing for such Interest Period;
 
(c)                                  then the Administrative Agent shall give notice (which may be telephonic) thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as promptly as practicable and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, and (ii) any Borrowing Request for a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars shall be treated as a request for an ABR Borrowing.
 
SECTION 2.15.                                                     Increased Costs.  (a)  If any Change in Law shall:
 
(i)                                     impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate);
 
(ii)                                  impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender; or
 
53





 
(iii)                               subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of the term Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, from time to time upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs or expenses incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b)                                 If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has had or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then, from time to time upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c)                                  [Reserved].
 
(d)                                 A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.15 delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
(e)                                  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any increased costs or expenses incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or expenses or reductions and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or expenses or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
 
54





 
SECTION 2.16.                                                     Break Funding Payments.  In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert or continue any Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto, (d) the failure to prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on a date specified therefor in any notice of prepayment given by the Borrower (whether or not such notice may be revoked in accordance with the terms hereof) or (e) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19 or 9.02(c), then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event.  Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan (but not including the Applicable Rate applicable thereto), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate such Lender would bid if it were to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in U.S. Dollars of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the London interbank market.  A certificate of any Lender delivered to the Borrower and setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof.
 
SECTION 2.17.                                                     Taxes.  (a)  Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.17) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
 
(b)                                 Payment of Other Taxes by the Loan Parties.  The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
 
55





 
(c)                                  Evidence of Payment.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.17, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(d)                                 Indemnification by the Loan Parties.  The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.17) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(e)                                  Indemnification by the Lenders.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).
 
(f)                                   Status of Lenders.  (i)  Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
 
56





 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
 
(ii)                                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person:
 
(A)                               any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
 
(B)                               any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(1)                                 in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;
 
(2)                                 executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
(3)                                 in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the
 
57





 
Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E; or
 
(4)                                 to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
 
(C)                               any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)                               if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their
 
58





 
obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

(g)                                  Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.17 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevan

indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund has not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed, and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
SECTION 2.18.                                                     Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs.  (a)  The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15 or 2.17, or otherwise) in U.S. Dollars prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without any setoff or counterclaim.  All such payments in U.S. Dollars shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its designated office, except payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein.  Any amounts received after the time required to be received hereunder on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payment received by it for the account of
 
59





 
any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments required to be made by any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made in U.S. Dollars except that any amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 9.03 (or any indemnification or expense reimbursement provision of any other Loan Document) that are invoiced in a currency other than U.S. Dollars shall be payable in the currency so invoiced.
 
(b)                                 If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
 
(c)                                  Except to the extent that this Agreement provides for payments to be disproportionately allocated to or retained by a particular Lender or group of Lenders, each Lender agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the aggregate amount of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amounts of principal of and accrued interest on their Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, as in effect from time to time), or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any Person that is an Eligible Assignee (as such term is defined from time to time).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent prohibited by applicable law as described in the definition of Excluded Swap Obligation, no amounts received from, or set off with respect to, any Loan Party shall be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligations of such Loan Party.
 
60





 
(d)                                 Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
(e)                                  If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it hereunder to or for the account of the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations in respect of such payment until all such unsatisfied obligations have been discharged or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender pursuant to Sections 2.06(a), 2.17(e), 2.18(d) and 9.03(c), in each case in such order as shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
 
SECTION 2.19.                                                     Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  (a)  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Loan Party is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or to any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use commercially reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment and delegation (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment and delegation.
 
(b)                                 If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or (iii) any Lender has become a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17) and obligations under this
 
61





 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment and delegation); provided that (A) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from the assignee (in the case of such principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts, (C) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (D) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver or consent by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation have ceased to apply.
 
SECTION 2.20.                                                     Defaulting Lenders.   Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
 
(a)                                 Waivers and Amendments.  The Commitment and Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); provided that any amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or all Lenders affected thereby shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02, require the consent of such Defaulting Lender in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
(b)                                 Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Non-Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.

then, subject to Section 4.04, and (i) in every such event (other than an event with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article VII), and at any time after the Closing Date and thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by written notice to the Borrower, take any or all of the following actions, at the same or different times:  (A) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately and (B) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part (but ratably as among the Loans at such time outstanding), in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued or owing hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, in each case without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower; and (ii) in the case of any event with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article VII, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrower hereunder, shall immediately and automatically become due, in each case without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date falling 180 days after the Closing Date (the Clean-Up Date), notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document, any breach of covenants, misrepresentation or other default which arises with respect to the Target Group will be deemed not to be a breach of representation or warranty, a breach of covenant or an Event of Default, as the case may be, if:
 
(i)                                     it is capable of remedy and reasonable steps are being taken to remedy it;
 
(ii)                                  the circumstances giving rise to it have not knowingly been procured by or approved by the Borrower; and
 
(iii)                               it is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis.
 
104





 
If the relevant circumstances are continuing on or after the Clean-Up Date, there shall be a breach of representation or warranty, breach of covenant or Event of Default, as the case may be, notwithstanding the above.
 
ARTICLE VIII
 
The Administrative Agent
 
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the entity named as Administrative Agent in the heading of this Agreement and its permitted successors to serve as administrative agent and collateral agent under the Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as Administrative Agent, to execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to take such actions and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto (including, as trustee under any Security Document governed by English, Israeli or other relevant law).  It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent (or any similar term) herein or in any other Loan Document with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary duty or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead, such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
 
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or to exercise any discretionary power (including with respect to enforcement and collection), except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in the Loan Documents); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could expose the Administrative Agent to liability or be contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or applicable law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents,
 
105





 
the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Affiliate of any of the foregoing that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  Notwithstanding clause (b) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take, or to omit to take, any action hereunder or under the Loan Documents unless, upon demand, the Administrative Agent receives an indemnification satisfactory to it from the Lenders (or, to the extent applicable and acceptable to the Administrative Agent, any other Secured Party) against all liabilities, costs and expenses that, by reason of such action or omission, may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent or any Related Person thereof.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in the Loan Documents) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment).  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have actual knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof (stating that it is a notice of default) is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or satisfaction of any condition that expressly refers to the matters described therein being acceptable or satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall not incur any liability for relying, upon any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof).  The Administrative Agent also shall be entitled to rely, and shall not incur any liability for relying, upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof), and may act upon any such statement prior to receipt of written confirmation thereof.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender
 
106





 
unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
The Administrative Agent may perform any of and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any of and all their duties and exercise their rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article VIII shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
 
Subject to the terms of this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time from its capacity as such.  In connection with such resignation, the Administrative Agent shall give written notice of its intent to resign to the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower (and so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, with the consent of the Borrower, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor which will be a bank with an office in New York, New York or an Affiliate of any such bank.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its intent to resign, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank subject, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, to the approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower and such successor.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its intent to resign, the retiring Administrative Agent may give notice of the effectiveness of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower, whereupon, on the date of effectiveness of such resignation stated in such notice, (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its
 
107





 
duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; provided that, solely for purposes of maintaining any security interest granted to the Administrative Agent under any Security Document for the benefit of the Secured Parties, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to be vested with such security interest and be subject to such compliance as collateral agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and, in the case of any Collateral in the possession of the Administrative Agent, shall continue to hold such Collateral, in each case until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed and accepts such appointment in accordance with this paragraph (it being understood and agreed that the retiring Administrative Agent shall have no duty or obligation to take any further action under any Security Document, including any action required to maintain the perfection of any such security interest), and (b) the Required Lenders shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent; provided that (i) all payments required to be made hereunder or under any other Loan Document to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Person other than the Administrative Agent shall be made directly to such Person and (ii) all notices and other communications required or contemplated to be given or made to the Administrative Agent shall also directly be given or made to each Lender.  Following the effectiveness of the Administrative Agents resignation from its capacity as such, the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.03, as well as any exculpatory, reimbursement and indemnification provisions set forth in any other Loan Document, shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent and in respect of the matters referred to in the proviso under clause (a) above.
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement and funding its Loans on the Effective Date, or delivering its signature page to an Assignment and Assumption or any other Loan Document pursuant to which it shall become a Lender hereunder, shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and approved, this Agreement and each other Loan Document and each other document required to be delivered to, or be approved by or satisfactory to, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders on the Effective Date (and the Closing Date, as applicable).
 
Except with respect to the exercise of setoff rights of any Lender in accordance with Section 9.08 or with respect to a Lenders right to file a proof of claim in an insolvency proceeding, no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize
 
108





 
upon any of the Collateral or to enforce any Guarantee of the Obligations, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under the Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms thereof.  In the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or other disposition, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale or other disposition, and the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Loan Document Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties at such sale or other disposition.
 
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation thereof, no Hedging Agreement the obligations under which constitute Secured Hedging Obligations will create (or be deemed to create) in favor of any Secured Party that is a party thereto any rights in connection with the management or release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Loan Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.  By accepting the benefits of the Collateral, each Secured Party that is a party to any such Hedging Agreement shall be deemed to have appointed the Administrative Agent to serve as administrative agent and collateral agent under the Loan Documents and agreed to be bound by the Loan Documents as a Secured Party thereunder, subject to the limitations set forth in this paragraph.
 
The Secured Parties irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 6.02(f).  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Administrative Agents Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.
 
In case of the pendency of any proceeding with respect to any Loan Party under any Federal, State or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
 
(a)                                 to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or
 
109





 
advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim under Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
 
(b)                                 to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and each other Secured Party to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders or the other Secured Parties, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due to it, in its capacity as the Administrative Agent, under the Loan Documents (including under Section 9.03).
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Arranger shall have no duties or obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except in its capacity, as applicable, as a Lender), but all such Persons shall have the benefit of the indemnities provided for hereunder.
 
The provisions of this Article VIII are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and, except solely to the extent of the Borrowers rights to consent and notice pursuant to and subject to the conditions set forth in this Article VIII, none of the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any such provisions.  Each Secured Party, whether or not a party hereto, will be deemed, by its acceptance of the benefits of the Collateral and the Guarantees of the Obligations provided under the Loan Documents, to have agreed to the provisions of this Article VIII.

(b)                                 Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet and intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices under Article II to any Lender if such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article II by electronic communication.  Any notices or other communications to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may be delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by the recipient thereof prior thereto; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited or rescinded by any such Person by notice to each other such Person.
 
Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the senders receipt of an acknowledgment from the intended recipient (such as by the return receipt requested function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgment) and (ii) notices and other communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient, at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i), of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefore; provided that, for both clauses (i) and (ii) above, if such notice or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient.

111





 
omissions in the Communications.  No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made, or shall be deemed to be made, by the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties in connection with the Communications or the Platform.
 
SECTION 9.02.                                                     Waivers; Amendments.  (a)  No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 9.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
 
(b)                                 Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, none of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders and, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders (unless the Administrative Agent has express authority herein or therein to consent unilaterally), provided that (i) any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency so long as, in each case, (A) such amendment does not adversely affect in any material respect the rights of any Lender or (B) the Lenders shall have received at least five Business Days prior written notice thereof and the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of the date of such notice to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that the Required Lenders object to such amendment and (ii) no such agreement shall (A) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (B) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon (except in connection with the waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates), or reduce any fees payable hereunder, in each case,  without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely effected thereby (in which case the separate consent of the Required Lenders shall not be required), (C) postpone the scheduled maturity date of any Loan, or the date of any scheduled payment of the principal amount of any Term Loan under Section 2.10,
 
112





 
or any date for the payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse 

 the definition of the term Required Lenders or any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or otherwise modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; provided that, with the consent of the Required Lenders, the provisions of this Section 9.02 and the definition of the term Required Lenders may be amended to include references to any new class of loans created under this Agreement (or to lenders extending such loans) on substantially the same basis as the corresponding references relating to the existing classes of Loans or Lenders, (F) release all or substantially all of the value of the Guarantees provided by the Loan Parties under the Guarantee Agreement without the written consent of each Lender (except as expressly provided in Section 9.14 or the Guarantee Agreement (including any such release by the Administrative Agent in connection with any sale or other disposition of any Subsidiary upon the exercise of remedies under the Security Documents), it being understood and agreed that an amendment or other modification of the type of obligations guaranteed under the Guarantee Agreement shall not be deemed to be a release or limitation of any Guarantee), (G) release all or substantially all the Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents without the written consent of each Lender (except as expressly provided in Section 9.14 or the applicable Security Document (including any such release by the Administrative Agent in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Collateral upon the exercise of remedies under the Security Documents), it being understood and agreed that an amendment or other modification of the type of obligations secured by the Security Documents shall not be deemed to be a release of the Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents) or (H) waive any of the conditions specified in Sections 4.01, 4.02 or 4.03 without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify, extend or otherwise affect the rights or obligations of the Administrative Agent without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, no consent with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be required of any Defaulting Lender, except with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of clause (ii) of the first proviso of this paragraph and then only in the event such Defaulting Lender shall be affected by such amendment, waiver or other modification.
 
(c)                                  In connection with any proposed amendment, modification, waiver, consent or termination (a Proposed Change) requiring the consent of all Lenders or all affected Lenders, if the consent of the Required Lenders (and, to the extent any Proposed Change requires the consent of Lenders holding Loans pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 9.02, the consent of a majority in interest of the outstanding
 
113





 
Loans and unused Commitments) to such Proposed Change is obtained, but the consent to such Proposed Change of other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is not obtained as described in paragraph (b) of this Section 9.02 being referred to as a Non-Consenting Lender), then, so long as the Lender that is acting as Administrative Agent is not a Non-Consenting Lender, the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Non-Consenting Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Non-Consenting Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Non-Consenting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, (iii) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the processing and recordation fee specified in Section 9.04(b), (iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law and (v) the assignee shall have given its consent to such Proposed Change.
 
(d)                                 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent may, without the consent of any Secured Party, consent to a departure by any Loan Party from any covenant of such Loan Party set forth in this Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement, the Collateral Agreement or any other Security Document to the extent such departure is consistent with the authority of the Administrative Agent set forth in the definition of the term Collateral and Guarantee Requirement.
 
(e)                                  The Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, with the concurrence of any Lender, execute amendments, waivers or other modifications on behalf of such Lender.  Any amendment, waiver or other modification effected in accordance with this Section 9.02 shall be binding upon each Person that is at the time thereof a Lender and each Person that subsequently becomes a Lender.

115





 
foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and whether initiated against or by any party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any Affiliate of any of the foregoing or any third party (and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto); provided that the foregoing indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, apply to any losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities or related expenses to the extent they (A) are found in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnitee, (B) result from a claim brought by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries for a material breach of such Indemnitees obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document if the Borrower or such Subsidiary has obtained a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in the Borrowers or its Subsidiarys favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or (C) result from a proceeding that does not involve an act or omission by the Borrower or any of its Affiliates and that is brought by an Indemnitee against any other Indemnitee (other than a proceeding that is brought against the Administrative Agent or any Arranger in its capacity as such or in fulfilling its roles as an agent or arranger hereunder or any similar role with respect to the Indebtedness incurred or to be incurred hereunder).  This paragraph shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims or damages arising from any non-Tax claim.

(d)                                 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, or permit any of its Affiliates or Related Parties to assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee (i) for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet) or (ii) on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.
 
(e)                                  All amounts due under this Section 9.03 shall be payable within ten Business Days after written demand therefor.

(A)                               the Borrower (it being agreed that notwithstanding anything herein, during the Certain Funds Period the Borrower may withhold such consent in its sole discretion unless a Certain Funds Default is continuing); provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required (1) for an assignment and delegation to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, (2) if an Event of Default (or during the Certain Funds Period a Certain Funds Default) has occurred and is continuing, for any other assignment and delegation; provided further that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment and delegation unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten Business Days after having received notice thereof; and
 
(B)                               the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment and delegation of any Term Loan to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.
 
(ii)                                  Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
 
117





 
(A)                               except in the case of an assignment and delegation to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment and delegation of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment or Loans , the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment and delegation (determined as of the trade date specified in the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment and delegation or, if no trade date is so specified, as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment and delegation is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $10,000,000;
 
(B)                               each partial assignment and delegation shall be made as an assignment and delegation of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement; provided that this clause (B) shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment and delegation of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations in respect of Commitments or Loans;
 
(C)                               the parties to each assignment and delegation shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, provided that (1) only one such processing and recordation fee shall be payable in the event of simultaneous assignments and delegations from any Lender or its Approved Funds to one or more other Approved Funds of such Lender and (2) with respect to any assignment and delegation pursuant to Section 2.19(b) or 9.02(c), the parties hereto agree that such assignment and delegation may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto; and
 
(D)                               the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall (1) deliver to the Administrative Agent and to the Borrower any tax forms required by Section 2.17(f) and (2) to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in which the assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain MNPI) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignees compliance procedures and applicable law, including Federal, State and foreign securities laws.
 
(iii)                               Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(v) of this Section 9.04, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder
 
118





 
shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned and delegated by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned and delegated by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of (and subject to the obligations and limitations of) Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03).  Any assignment, delegation or other transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 9.04(c).
 
(iv)                              The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and, as to entries pertaining to it, any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(v)                                 Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignees completed Administrative Questionnaire and any tax forms required by Section 2.17(f) (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 9.04 and any written consent to such assignment and delegation required by paragraph (b) of this Section 9.04, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to accept such Assignment and Assumption or so record the information contained therein if the Administrative Agent reasonably believes that such Assignment and Assumption lacks any written consent required by this Section 9.04 or is otherwise not in proper form, it being acknowledged that the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or obligation (and shall incur no liability) with respect to obtaining (or confirming the receipt) of any such written consent or with respect to the form of (or any defect in)
 
119





 
such Assignment and Assumption, any such duty and obligation being solely with the assigning Lender and the assignee.  No assignment or delegation shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph, and following such recording, unless otherwise determined by the Administrative Agent (such determination to be made in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent, which determination may be conditioned on the consent of the assigning Lender and the assignee), shall be effective notwithstanding any defect in the Assignment and Assumption relating thereto.  Each assigning Lender and the assignee, by its execution and delivery of an Assignment and Assumption, shall be deemed to have represented to the Administrative Agent that all written consents required by this Section 9.04 with respect thereto (other than the consent of the Administrative Agent) have been obtained and that such Assignment and Assumption is otherwise duly completed and in proper form, and each assignee, by its execution and delivery of an Assignment and Assumption, shall be deemed to have represented to the assigning Lender and the Administrative Agent that such assignee is an Eligible Assignee.
 
(vi)                              The words execution, signed, signature and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as applicable, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act or any other similar State laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
 
(c)                                  Any Lender may, without the consent of (or notice to) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more Eligible Assignees (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and Loans ); provided that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant or requires the approval of all the Lenders.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the
 
120





 
requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.17(f) (it being understood and agreed that the documentation required under Section 2.17(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 9.04; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.18 and 2.19 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section 9.04 and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers request and reasonable expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.19(b) with respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
(d)                                 Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section 9.04 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(e)                                  Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any attempted assignment or sale of a participation to a Person who is not an Eligible Assignee shall be null and void.
 
121





 
SECTION 9.05.                                                     Survival.  All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, any Lender or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time this Agreement or any other Loan Document is executed and delivered or any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.  The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.18(e) and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
 
SECTION 9.06.                                                     Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, upon the Administrative Agents request, the Loan Parties agree to promptly execute and deliver such amendments to this Agreement (other than any amendment to the definition of Certain Funds Default, Certain Funds Period, Certain Funds Purposes, Long Stop Date, Mandatory Cancellation Event, Certain Funds Representations (or any Section or definition referred to therein or any Section including any of those terms, or cross-references to any of the Sections referred to in this Section to the extent modifying the conditionality or availability of the Initial Term Loans in a manner adverse to the Borrower), Section 4.02, Section 4.03, Section 4.04, Sections 9.04, 9.19 or this Section 9.06 or that would otherwise impair the availability of the Initial Term Loans for Certain Funds Purposes during the Certain Funds Period or would otherwise conflict with restrictions set out in Section 4.04 (it being understood this parenthetical shall not restrict modifications to the fees and pricing of the Initial Term Loans nor shall it restrict immaterial changes to such provisions)) as shall be necessary to implement any modifications to this Agreement pursuant to any separate letter agreements between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent during the period permitted therein.  This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent or the syndication of the Loans and Commitments constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto,
 
122





 
and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
 
SECTION 9.07.                                                     Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
SECTION 9.08.                                                     Right of Setoff.  Subject to Section 4.04, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the making of the request or the granting of the consent specified in Article VI to authorize the Administrative Agent to declare the Loans due and payable pursuant to Article VI shall have occurred, each Lender and each of its Affiliates, is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) or other amounts at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Loan Parties against any of and all the obligations then due of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender or any such Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or any such Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations of the Loan Parties are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or any such Affiliate different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such Indebtedness.  Each Lender agrees to notify the applicable Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give or any delay in giving such notice shall not affect the validity of any such setoff and application.
 
SECTION 9.09.                                                     Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.  (a)  This Agreement and any claim, controversy, dispute or cause of action (whether in contract or tort or otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.
 
(b)                                 The Borrower each irrevocably and unconditionally agree that it will not commence any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing in any way relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions relating hereto or thereto, in any forum other than the courts of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in respect of any action, litigation or proceeding may be heard
 
123





 
and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such Federal court.  Each party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action, litigation or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any Loan Party or any of its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
 
(c)                                  The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action, litigation or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 9.09.  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

SECTION 9.12.                                                     Confidentiality.  Each Lender acknowledges that its ability to disclose information concerning the Transactions is restricted by the City Code and the Panel and that Section 9.12 is subject to those restrictions. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
 
124





 
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Related Parties, including accountants, legal counsel and other agents and advisors, it being understood and agreed that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential, (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process (provided that the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, agrees that it will, to the extent practicable and other than with respect to any audit or examination conducted by bank accountants or any governmental bank regulatory authority exercising examination or regulatory authority, notify the Borrower promptly thereof, unless such notification is prohibited by law), (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, in each case, only such information as is reasonably necessary to exercise such remedies or enforce such rights, (f) subject to an agreement containing confidentiality undertakings substantially similar to those of this Section 9.12, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its Related Parties) to any Hedging Agreement relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary and its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (g) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided for herein or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers with respect to the credit facilities provided for herein, (h) with the consent of the Borrower or (i) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 9.12 or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or its Subsidiary.  For purposes of this Section 9.12, Information means all information received from the Borrower or its Related Parties relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or their businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender prior to disclosure by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries on a nonconfidential basis from a Person that is not subject to a confidentiality obligation to the Borrower or any of its Related Parties.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 9.12 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if it has complied with the requirements set forth in this Section 9.12 and such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information (absent gross negligence or willful misconduct).

Each Lender acknowledges that its ability to disclose information concerning the Transactions is restricted by the City Code and the Panel and that Section 9.12 is subject to those restrictions.
 
(b)                                 The Borrower and each Lender acknowledge that, if information furnished by the Borrower pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is being distributed by the Administrative Agent through the Platform, (i) the Administrative Agent may post any information that the Borrower has indicated as containing MNPI solely on that portion of the Platform designated for Private Side Lender Representatives
 
127





 
and (ii) if the Borrower has not indicated whether any information furnished by it pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement contains MNPI, the Administrative Agent reserves the right to post such information solely on that portion of the Platform as is designated for Private Side Lender Representatives.  The Borrower agrees to clearly designate all information provided to the Administrative Agent by or on behalf of the Borrower that is suitable to be made available to Public Side Lender Representatives, and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such designation by the Borrower without liability or responsibility for the independent verification thereof.
 
SECTION 9.18.                                                     Judgment Currency.  (a)  If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in U.S. Dollars into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction U.S. Dollars could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.
 
(b)                                 The obligations of each party hereto in respect of any sum due to any other party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the Applicable Creditor) shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the Judgment Currency) other than U.S. Dollars, be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase U.S. Dollars with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of U.S. Dollars so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in U.S. Dollars, such party agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such deficiency.  The obligations of the parties contained in this Section 9.18 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.
 
SECTION 9.19.                                                     Debt Syndication During the Certain Funds Period.  Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent confirms that it is aware of the terms and requirements of Practice Statement No. 25 (Debt Syndication during Offer Periods) issued by the Panel.

(f)                                   None of the Administrative Agent or the Secured Parties shall have any responsibility for, or liability for its failure in, observing or performing any obligations to be observed and performed by such Grantor under any contract, agreement or instrument relating to the Article 9 Collateral, and such Grantor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties from and against any and all liability for such performance.
 
(g)                                  Such Grantor shall not make or permit to be made any transfer of the Article 9 Collateral (other than Dispositions permitted under the Credit Agreement).

(i)                                     Such Grantor irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent (and its designees) as such Grantors true and lawful agent (and attorney-in-fact) for the purpose, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, of making, settling and adjusting claims in respect of Article 9 Collateral under policies of insurance, endorsing the name of such Grantor on any check, draft, instrument or other item of payment for the proceeds of such policies of insurance and for making all determinations and decisions with respect thereto.  In the event that such Grantor at any time or times shall fail to obtain or maintain any of the policies of insurance required pursuant to Section 5.07 of the Credit Agreement, or to pay any premium in whole or part relating thereto, the Administrative Agent may, without waiving or releasing any obligation or liability of the Grantors hereunder or any Event of Default, in its sole discretion, obtain and maintain such policies of insurance and pay such premium and take any other actions with respect thereto as the Administrative Agent deems reasonably necessary after providing ten (10) days notice to such Grantor.  All sums disbursed by the Administrative Agent in connection with this paragraph, including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket outside counsel attorneys fees, court costs, expenses and other charges relating thereto, shall be payable reasonably promptly upon written demand by such Grantor to the Administrative Agent and shall be additional Obligations secured hereby.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, all insurance payments, proceeds of insurance and any awards arising from condemnation of any Collateral of such Grantor received by the Administrative Agent in connection with any loss, damage or destruction of any Collateral shall be transferred to such Grantor.
 
SECTION 3.04.                                   Instruments and Tangible Chattel Paper.  Without limiting such Grantors obligations under Article II, if such Grantor shall at any time after the Closing Date acquire any Instruments (other than any instrument with a face amount of less than $10,000,000) or Tangible Chattel Paper (other than Tangible Chattel Paper with a value less than $10,000,000) constituting Collateral, such Grantor shall within 30 days (or such other period as may be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) after acquisition thereof endorse, assign and deliver the same to the Administrative Agent, accompanied by such instruments of transfer or assignment duly executed in blank as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably request.
 
SECTION 3.05.                                   Intellectual Property Covenant.
 
(a)                                 Such Grantor agrees that it will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve, renew, and keep in full force and effect the legal existence of all Intellectual Property, which, in the reasonable judgment of the Borrower, is material to the conduct of the business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
 
(b)                                 Such Grantor agrees that, should it acquire an ownership or other interest in any Article 9 Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property after the Closing Date (After-Acquired Intellectual Property), (i) the provisions of this Agreement shall automatically apply thereto, and (ii) any such After-Acquired Intellectual Property shall automatically become part of the Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement with respect thereto.  Such Grantor shall (i) within twenty (20) days of such acquisition, with respect to any United States registered Copyrights or exclusive Copyright Licenses for United States registered Copyrights, provide the Administrative Agent with an updated Schedule III, Part 3, (ii) within sixty (60) days of such acquisition, with respect to any United States registered Patents, Trademarks and applications therefor, provide the Administrative Agent with an updated Schedule III, Parts 1 and 2 and (iii) promptly after providing such updates, execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an appropriate IP Security Agreement supplement to evidence the Administrative Agents security interest in any United States registered or applied for After-Acquired Intellectual Property.  In each case, such Grantor will promptly cooperate as reasonably necessary to enable the Administrative Agent to make any necessary or advisable recordations with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office, as applicable.
 
13





 
(c)                                  With respect to each item of its material registered Intellectual Property and material applications therefor, such Grantor agrees to take all commercially reasonable steps (i) to maintain the validity and enforceability of any such Intellectual Property and to maintain such Intellectual Property in full force and effect and (ii) to pursue the registration and maintenance of each such registration or application, now or hereafter included in the Intellectual Property of such Grantor, including the payment of required fees and taxes, the filing of responses to office actions issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or other governmental authorities, the filing of applications for renewal or extension, the filing of affidavits under Sect

s competitive value), except to the extent that so acting or the failure to so act would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(e)                                  Such Grantor shall take all commercially reasonable steps to preserve and protect each item of its material Intellectual Property, including maintaining the quality of any and all products or services used or provided in connection with any of the Trademarks, consistent with the quality of the products and services as of the date hereof, and taking all reasonable steps to ensure that all licensed users of any of the Trademarks abide by the applicable licenses terms with respect to the standards of quality, except to the extent that the failure to so act would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(f)                                   In the event that such Grantor has reason to believe that any Intellectual Property material to the conduct of the business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, has been or is likely to be infringed, misappropriated or diluted by a third party, such Grantor shall, if consistent with reasonable business judgment, promptly sue for infringement, misappropriation or dilution and to recover any and all damages for such infringement, misappropriation or dilution, and take such other actions as appropriate in such Grantors reasonable business judgment.
 
SECTION 3.06.                                   Commercial Tort Claims. In the event any Supplement shall set forth any Commercial Tort Claim, Schedule IV shall be deemed to be supplemented to include the reference to such Commercial Tort Claim (and the description thereof), in the same form as such reference and description are set forth on such Supplement.
 
ARTICLE IV
 
Remedies
 
SECTION 4.01.                                   Remedies Upon Default.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, after the Administrative Agent shall have notified the Grantors that it is exercising its rights under this Section 4.01, each Grantor agrees to deliver each item of Collateral to the Administrative Agent on written demand, and it is agreed that the Administrative Agent shall have the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times:  (a) with respect to any Article 9 Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property, on written demand, to cause the Security Interest to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such Article 9 Collateral by the
 
14





 
applicable Grantors to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, or to license or sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis, any such Article 9 Collateral throughout the world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine (other than in violation of any then-existing licensing arrangements to the extent that waivers cannot be obtained using commercially reasonable efforts), and (b) with or without legal process or demand for performance, to take upon prior notice possession of the Article 9 Collateral and without liability for trespass to enter upon prior notice any premises where the Article 9 Collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the Article 9 Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the Administrative Agent shall have the right upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral at a public or private sale or at any brokers board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate.  The Administrative Agent shall be authorized to take the actions set forth in Sections 4.03, 4.04 and 4.05.  Each such purchaser at any sale of Collateral shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal that such Grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
 
The Administrative Agent shall give the applicable Grantors no less than 10 days prior written notice (which each Grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Administrative Agents intention to make any sale of Collateral.  Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a brokers board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange.  Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Administrative Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale.  At any such sale, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Administrative Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine.  The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given.  The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned.  In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice.  In the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or other disposition, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale or other disposition, and the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Loan Document Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties at such sale or other disposition.  As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Administrative Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof
 
15





 
pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.  Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.01 shall be deemed to conform to commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions.
 
SECTION 4.02.                                   Application of Proceeds.  The Administrative Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection, sale, foreclosure or other realization upon any Collateral, including any Collateral consisting of cash, as follows:
 
FIRST, subject to Section 9.03 of the Credit Agreement, to the payment of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with such collection, sale, foreclosure or realization or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the Obligations, including all court costs and the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of its agents and outside legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document on behalf of any Grantor and any other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document;
 
SECOND, to the Payment In Full of the Obligations (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the Secured Parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the Obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution); and
 
THIRD, to the Grantors, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.
 
The Administrative Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement.  Upon any sale of Collateral by the Administrative Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the Administrative Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Administrative Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.  The Grantors shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all Obligations, including any outside counsel attorneys fees and other documented expenses incurred by Administrative Agent or any Lender to collect such deficiency.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the proceeds of any collection, sale, foreclosure or realization upon any Collateral of any Grantor, including any collateral consisting of cash, shall not be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligation of such Grantor and shall instead be applied to other obligations.
 
SECTION 4.03.                                   Grant of License To Use Intellectual Property.  For the purpose of enabling the Administrative Agent to exercise rights and remedies under this Agreement at such time as the Administrative Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each Grantor hereby grants to the Administrative Agent an irrevocable, nonexclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the Grantors) to use, license or sublicense any of the Article 9 Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property now owned or hereafter acquired by such Grantor, and wherever the same may be located, and including in such license access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof, the right to prosecute and maintain all Intellectual Property and the right to sue for past, present or future infringement of the Intellectual Property, to the extent that such non-exclusive license (a) does not violate the express terms of any agreement between a Grantor and a third
 
16





 
party governing the applicable Grantors use of such Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property, or gives such third party any right of acceleration, modification or cancelation therein and (b) is not prohibited by any Requirements of Law other than, in each case, to the extent that any such term or prohibition would be rendered ineffective pursuant to any other applicable Requirements of Law, including pursuant to Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the New York UCC or any other applicable law.  The use of such license by the Administrative Agent may be exercised, at the option of the Administrative Agent, only upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default; provided that any license, sublicense or other transaction entered into by the Administrative Agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon the Grantors notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an Event of Default.
 
SECTION 4.04.                                   Securities Act.  In view of the position of the Grantors in relation to the Pledged Collateral, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the Securities Act as now or hereafter in effect or any similar statute hereafter enacted analogous in purpose or effect (such Act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the Federal Securities Laws) with respect to any disposition of the Pledged Collateral permitted hereunder.  Each Grantor understands that compliance with the Federal Securities Laws might very strictly limit the course of conduct of the Administrative Agent if the Administrative Agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the Pledged Collateral, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any Pledged Collateral could dispose of the same.  Similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the Administrative Agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the Pledged Collateral under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect.  Each Grantor recognizes that in light of such restrictions and limitations the Administrative Agent may, with respect to any sale of the Pledged Collateral, and shall be authorized to, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such Pledged Collateral for their own account for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale may assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Pledged Collateral so sold.  Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that in light of such restrictions and limitations, the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, (a) may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Pledged Collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under the Federal Securities Laws or, to the extent applicable, blue sky or other state securities laws to the extent the Administrative Agent has determined that such registration is not required by any Requirement of Law and (b) may approach and negotiate with a limited number of potential purchasers (including a single potential purchaser) to effect such sale.  Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions.  In the event of any such sale, the Administrative Agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the Pledged Collateral at a price that the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem fair under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a limited number of potential purchasers (or a single purchaser) were approached.  The provisions of this Section 4.04 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the Administrative Agent sells.
 
ARTICLE V   Indemnity, Subrogation, Contribution and Subordination
 
SECTION 5.01.                                   Indemnity and Subrogation.  In addition to all such rights of indemnity as the Grantors may have under applicable law (but subject to Section 5.03), each of the Borrower and each Domestic Subsidiary Loan Party agrees that in the event any assets of any Grantor
 
17





 
shall be sold pursuant to this Agreement or any other Security Document to satisfy in whole or in part any Obligation of the Borrower or such Domestic Subsidiary Loan Party, the Borrower (if such Obligation is an obligation of the Borrower), or such Domestic Subsidiary Loan Party (if such Obligation is an obligation of such Domestic Subsidiary Loan Party), shall indemnify such Grantor therefor.
 
SECTION 5.02.                                   Contribution and Subrogation.  Each Grantor (each such Grantor (other than, in the case of any payment referred to in this sentence in respect of any Obligation of the Borrower or any Domestic Subsidiary Loan Party, the Borrower or such Domestic Subsidiary Loan Party, as applicable) being called a Contributing Party) agrees (subject to Section 5.03) that, in the event assets of any other Grantor shall be sold pursuant to any Security Document to satisfy any Obligation (other than any assets of the Borrower or of any Domestic Subsidiary Loan Party sold to satisfy its own Obligations) and such other Grantor (the Claiming Party) shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrower or the applicable Domestic Subsidiary Loan Party, as applicable, as provided in Section 5.01, such Contributing Party shall indemnify the Claiming Party therefor.  Any Contributing Party making any payment to a Claiming Party pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall (subject to Section 5.03) be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Party under Section 5.01 to the extent of such payment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any Claiming Partys right to indemnification hereunder arises from a sale of Collateral made to satisfy Obligations constituting Swap Obligations, only those Contributing Parties for whom such Swap Obligations do not constitute Excluded Swap Obligations shall indemnify such Claiming Party.
 
SECTION 5.03.                                   Subordination.  (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all rights of the Grantors under Sections 5.01 and 5.02 and all other rights of the Grantors of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to Payment In Full.  No failure on the part of the Borrower or any other Grantor to make the payments required by Sections 5.01 and 5.02 (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Grantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Grantor shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Grantor hereunder.
 
(b)                                 Each Grantor hereby agrees that all Indebtedness and other monetary obligations owed by it to, or to it by, any other Grantor or any other Subsidiary shall be fully subordinated to Payment In Full.
 
ARTICLE VI
 
Miscellaneous
 
SECTION 6.01.                                   Notices.  All communications and notices to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement.  All communications and notices hereunder to any Domestic Subsidiary Loan Party shall be given to it in care of the Borrower as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement.
 
SECTION 6.02.                                   Waivers; Amendment.  (a)  No failure or delay by any Secured Party in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Secured Parties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any
 
18





 
Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 6.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.  No notice or demand on any Loan Party in any case shall entitle any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
 
(b)                                 Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified (other than supplements expressly contemplated hereby) except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is applicable, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement; provided that the Administrative Agent may, without the consent of any Secured Party, consent to a departure by any Loan Party from any covenant of such Loan Party set forth herein or in any other Security Document to the extent such departure is not inconsistent with the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement or with any other limitation on the authority of the Administrative Agent set forth in the Credit Agreement.
 
(c)                                  This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Loan Party and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Loan Party without the approval of any other Loan Party and without affecting the obligations of any other Loan Party hereunder.
 
SECTION 6.03.                                   Administrative Agents Fees and Expenses; Indemnification.  (a)  The Loan Parties party hereto jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Administrative Agent for its fees and expenses incurred hereunder as provided in Section 9.03(a) of the Credit Agreement as if each reference therein to the Borrower were a reference to the Grantors.
 
(b)                                 The Grantors jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee as provided in Section 9.03(b) of the Credit Agreement as if each reference to the Borrower therein were a reference to the Grantors.
 
(c)                                  Any amounts payable hereunder, including as provided in Section 6.03(a) or 6.03(b), shall be additional Obligations secured hereby and by the other Security Documents.  All amounts due under Section 6.03(a) or 6.03(b) shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.
 
(d)                                 To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Grantor shall assert, or permit any of its subsidiaries to assert, and each Grantor hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee (i) for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet), unless determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, or (ii) on any theory of liability, for special, i

ies and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Secured Party and notwithstanding that any Secured Party may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any Loan Document is executed and delivered or any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and, subject to Section 6.11 hereof, shall continue in full force and effect until Payment In Full.
 
SECTION 6.05.                                   Counterparts; Effectiveness; Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement shall become effective as to any Loan Party when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Loan Party shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Loan Party and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Loan Party, the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Loan Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein or in the Collateral (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Loan Party shall be null and void), except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or the Credit Agreement.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
 
SECTION 6.06.                                   Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision i

terminations of financing statements necessary to evidence such termination or release.  Any execution and delivery of documents by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
 
SECTION 6.12.                                   Additional Subsidiaries.  Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, certain Subsidiaries not party hereto on the Closing Date may be required to enter into this Agreement.  Upon the execution and delivery by the Administrative Agent and any such Subsidiary of a Supplement, such Subsidiary shall become a Domestic Subsidiary Loan Party and a Grantor hereunder, with the same force and effect as if originally named as such herein.  The execution and delivery of any Supplement shall not require the consent of any other Loan Party.  The rights and obligations of each Loan Party hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Domestic Subsidiary Loan Party as a party to this Agreement.
 
SECTION 6.13.                                   Administrative Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact.  Each Grantor hereby appoints the Administrative Agent the attorney-in-fact of such Grantor for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem necessary to accomplish the purposes hereof at any time after and during the continuance of an Event of Default, which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall have the right, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and notice by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower of its intent to exercise such rights, with full power of substitution either in the Administrative Agents name or in the name of such Grantor (a) to receive, endorse, assign and/or deliver any and all notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money orders or other evidences of payment relating to the Collateral or any part thereof; (b) to demand, collect, receive payment of, give receipt for and give discharges and releases of all or any of the Collateral; (c) to sign the name of any Grantor on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the Collateral; (d) to commence and prosecute any and all suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect or otherwise realize on all or any of the Collateral or to enforce any rights in respect of any Collateral; (e) to settle, compromise, compound, adjust or defend any actions, suits or proceedings relating to all or any of the Collateral; and (f) to use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with all or any of the Collateral, and to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner of the Collateral for all purposes; provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the Administrative Agent to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the Administrative Agent, or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby.  The Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts actually received as a result of the exercise of the powers granted to them herein, and neither they nor their Related Parties shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment).
 
SECTION 6.14.                                   Secured Cash Management Obligations and Secured Hedging Obligations.  No Secured Party that obtains the benefit of this Agreement shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to, any action hereunder or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including, without limitation, the release or impairment of any Collateral) other than in its capacity as a Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, and, in any such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents, including without limitation Article VIII of the Credit Agreement.  Each Secured Party not a party to the Credit Agreement that obtains the benefit of this Agreement shall be deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the appointment of the Administrative

A.  Reference is made to the 364-Day Bridge Credit Agreement dated as of January [11], 2016 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement), among the Borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto and JPMCB, as Administrative Agent.
 
B.  Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Collateral Agreement and the Credit Agreement referred to therein, as applicable.

SECTION 2.  The New Subsidiary represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties that this Supplement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by it and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors rights generally and to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
 





 
SECTION 3.  This Supplement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Supplement shall become effective when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of the New Subsidiary shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Supplement by facsimile or other electronic imaging shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Supplement.

SECTION 5.  Except as expressly supplemented hereby, the Collateral Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
 
SECTION 6.  THIS SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

SECTION 7.  Any provision of this Supplement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction
 
SECTION 8.  All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in Section 6.01 of the Collateral Agreement.

Guarantee
 
SECTION 2.01.                                   Guarantee.  Each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, by way of an independent payment obligation, the punctual payment of the Obligations when due (other than, with respect to any Loan Party, any Excluded Swap Obligations of such Loan Party).  Each Guarantor (solely in its capacity as such) further agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed (in the case of the Loan Document Obligations, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement), in whole or in part, or amended or modified (in the case of the Loan Document Obligations, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement), without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension, renewal, amendment or modification of any Obligation.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to the Borrower or any other Loan Party of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee hereunder and notice of protest for nonpayment.
 
SECTION 2.02.                                   Guarantee of Payment; Continuing Guarantee.  Each Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to any security held for the payment of the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in favor of the Borrower, the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person.  Each Guarantor agrees that its guarantee hereunder is continuing in nature and applies to all Obligations, whether currently existing or hereafter incurred.
 
SECTION 2.03.                                   No Limitations.  (a) Except for the termination or release of a Guarantors obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section 4.11 or any Guarantor Limit, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of the Obligations or otherwise.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for the termination or release of its obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section 4.11 or any Guarantor Limit, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the obligations of each Guarantor
 
2





 
hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, any Loan Document or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement; (iii) except for the release of any Guarantors Collateral as expressly provided in any Collateral Agreement to which such Guarantor is a party, the release of, or any impairment of or failure to perfect any Lien on or security interest in, any security held by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party for any of the Obligations; (iv) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations; or (v) any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than Payment In Full).  Each Guarantor expressly authorizes the Secured Parties to take and hold security for the payment and performance of the Obligations, to exchange, waive or release any or all such security (with or without consideration), to enforce or apply such security and direct the order and manner of any sale thereof in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Loan Documents in their sole discretion or to release or substitute any one or more other guarantors or obligors upon or in respect of the Obligations, all without affecting the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder.
 
(b)                                 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower or any other Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, other than Payment In Full.  The Administrative Agent (acting on behalf of the Secured Parties) may, at its election and in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Loan Documents, foreclose on any security held by it by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with the Borrower or any other Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to it against the Borrower or any other Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent Payment In Full shall have occurred.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Loan Party, as the case may be, or any security.
 
SECTION 2.04.                                   Reinstatement.  Each Guarantor agrees that unless released pursuant to Section 4.11, this Agreement and its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or otherwise.
 
SECTION 2.05.                                   Agreement to Pay; Subrogation.  In furtherance of the foregoing provisions of this Article II and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, but subject to any Guarantor Limit, upon the failure of the Borrower or any other Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will promptly pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the applicable Secured Parties in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligation.  Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Loan Party arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subject to Article III.
 
3





 
SECTION 2.06.                                   Information.  Each Guarantor (a) assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrowers and each other Loan Partys financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and (b) agrees that none of the Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties will have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.
 
ARTICLE III
 
Indemnity, Subrogation, Contribution and Subordination
 
SECTION 3.01.                                   Indemnity and Subrogation.  In addition to all such rights of indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law (but subject to Section 3.03), each Guarantor agrees that in the event a payment in respect of any Obligation shall be made by any Guarantor (other than such Guarantor, if such Obligation is of such Guarantor) under this Agreement, such Guarantor shall indemnify such other Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment.
 
SECTION 3.02.                                   Contribution and Subrogation.  Each Guarantor (each such Guarantor (other than

 of this Agreement to the contrary, all rights of the Guarantors under Sections 3.01 and 3.02 and all other rights of the Guarantors of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to Payment In Full.  No failure on the part of any Guarantor to make the payments required by Sections 3.01 and 3.02 (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Guarantor shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.
 
(b)                                 Each Guarantor hereby agrees that all Indebtedness and other monetary obligations owed by it to any other Guarantor or any other Subsidiary shall be fully subordinated to Payment In Full.

SECTION 4.02.                                   Waivers; Amendment.  (a) No failure or delay by any Secured Party in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Secured Parties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 4.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.  No notice or demand on any Loan Party in any case shall entitle any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
 
(b)                                 Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified (other than supplements expressly contemplated hereby) except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is applicable, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement; provided that the Administrative Agent may, without the consent of any Secured Party, consent to a departure by any Loan Party from any covenant of such Loan Party set forth herein or in any other Security Document to the extent such departure is not inconsistent with the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement or with any other limitation on the authority of the Administrative Agent set forth in the Credit Agreement.
 
(c)                                  This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Loan Party and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Loan Party without the approval of any other Loan Party and without affecting the obligations of any other Loan Party hereunder.
 
SECTION 4.03.                                   Administrative Agents Fees and Expenses; Indemnification.  (a) The Loan Parties party hereto jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Administrative Agent for its fees and expenses incurred hereunder as provided in Section 9.03(a) of the Credit Agreement as if each reference therein to the Borrower were a reference to the Guarantors.
 
(b)                                 The Guarantors jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee as provided in Section 9.03(b) of the Credit Agreement as if each reference to the Borrower therein were a reference to the Guarantors.
 
(c)                                  Any amounts payable hereunder, including as provided in Section 4.03(a) or 4.03(b), shall be additional Obligations secured hereby and by the other Security Documents.  All amounts due under Section 4.03(a) or 4.03(b) shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.
 
(d)                                 To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Guarantor shall assert, or permit any of its subsidiaries to assert, and each Guarantor hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee (i) for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet), unless

determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, or (ii) on any theory of liabilit

ies and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Secured Party and notwithstanding that any Secured Party may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any Loan Document is executed and delivered or any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and, subject to Section 4.11 hereof, shall continue in full force and effect until Payment In Full.
 
SECTION 4.05.                                   Counterparts; Effectiveness; Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement shall become effective as to any Loan Party when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Loan Party shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Loan Party and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Loan Party, the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Loan Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Loan Party shall be null and void), except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or the Credit Agreement.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
 
SECTION 4.06.                                   Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisd

6





 
that all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by it or any of its Affiliates shall be brought, and shall be heard and determined, exclusively in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court.  Each party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against any Loan Party or any of its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
 
(c)                                  Each of the Loan Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 4.07.  Each of the Loan Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
 
(d)                                 Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 4.01.  Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in an

(c)                                  In connection with any termination or release pursuant to this Section 4.11, the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to any Loan Party, at such Loan Partys expense, all documents that such Loan Party shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or release.  Any execution and delivery of documents by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 4.11 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
