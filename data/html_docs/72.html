Agents Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Swing Line Advance to be purchased by such Lender. Each Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale and assignment. Each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees, promptly upon receipt of such notice from the Administrative Agent, to purchase its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding Swing Line Advance on the third Business Day after the date demand therefor. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swing Line Advances pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance
of a Default or Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Upon any such assignment by any Swing Line Lender to any
other Lender of a portion of a Swing Line Advance, such Swing Line Lender represents and warrants to such other Lender that such Swing Line Lender is the legal and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, but makes no other
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to such Swing Line Advance, this Agreement, the Notes or the Borrowers. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Swing Line Advance available
to the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such Lender is required to have made such amount available to the
Administrative Agent until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the higher of the Overnight Rate and the cost of funds incurred by the Administrative Agent in respect of such amount, plus any administrative, processing or
similar fees customarily charge by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such amount for the account of such Swing Line Lender on any Business Day, such amount so paid in
respect of principal shall constitute a Swing Line Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Swing Line Advance made by such Swing Line Lender shall be reduced by
such amount on such Business Day. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(e) At any time after any Lender has funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Advance, if any Swing
Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Advance, such Swing Line Lender will promptly distribute to such Lender its ratable share thereof in the same funds as those received by such Swing Line Lender. </p>
