any participation, than its participating Bank would have been entitled to

participation agrees, at the Borrower's request and expense, to use reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section
8.06 with respect to any Participant. Each Bank that sells a participation
shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower,
maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant
and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest
in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the </font><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Participant Register</font></u><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">); </font><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">provided</font></u><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> that no Bank
shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant
Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating
to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its
other obligations hereunder) to any Person except to the extent that such
disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of
credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of
the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register
shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Bank shall treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such
participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to
the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Servicing Agent (in its capacity
as Servicing Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant
Register.</font></p>
