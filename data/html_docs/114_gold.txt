(A)
Except as provided in subsection (C) below, Revolving Loans shall accrue interest at the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable
Margin.
(B)
The LIBOR Rate may be adjusted by Agent with respect to any Lender on a prospective basis to take into account any additional
or increased costs to such Lender of maintaining or obtaining any eurodollar deposits or increased costs, in each case, due to
changes in applicable Law occurring subsequent to the commencement of the then applicable Interest Period, including changes in
tax laws (except changes of general applicability in corporate income tax laws) and changes in the reserve requirements imposed
by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor), which additional or increased costs would increase
the cost of funding loans bearing interest based upon the LIBOR Rate; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules,
guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives
promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar
authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed
to be a "change in applicable Law", regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued. In any such event, the affected
Lender shall give Borrowers and Agent notice of such a determination and adjustment and Agent promptly shall transmit the notice
to each other Lender and, upon its receipt of the notice from the affected Lender, Borrowers may, by notice to such affected Lender
(I) require such Lender to furnish to Borrowers a statement setting forth the basis for adjusting such LIBOR Rate and the
method for determining the amount of such adjustment, or (II) repay the Loans bearing interest based upon the LIBOR Rate with
respect to which such adjustment is made.
(C)
In the event that any change in market conditions or any law, regulation, treaty, or directive, or any change therein or
in the interpretation of application thereof, shall at any time after the date hereof, in the reasonable opinion of any Lender,
make it unlawful or impractical for such Lender to fund or maintain Loans bearing interest based upon the LIBOR Rate or to continue
such funding or maintaining, or to determine or charge interest rates at the LIBOR Rate, such Lender shall give notice of such
changed circumstances to Agent and Borrowers and Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and (I) in
the case of any outstanding Loans of such Lender bearing interest based upon the LIBOR Rate, the date specified in such Lender's
notice shall be deemed to be the last day of the Interest Period of such Loans, and interest upon such Lender's Loans thereafter
shall accrue interest at Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, and (II) such Loans shall continue to accrue interest at Base
Rate plus the Applicable Margin until such Lender determines that it would no longer be unlawful or impractical to maintain such
Loans at the LIBOR Rate.

Borrowers shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of all Lenders committed to make Revolving Loans on the Closing Date, a fee as compensation
for the costs of such Lenders being prepared to make funds available to Borrowers under this Agreement, equal to an amount determined
by multiplying the Revolving Loan Commitment by the following applicable percentage amount: 2.5% for the first year following the

by Agent in respect of such wires.
(i)
Late Charges. If payments of principal (other than a final installment of principal upon the Termination Date), interest
due on the Obligations, or any other amounts due hereunder or under the other Financing Documents are not timely made and remain
overdue for a period of five (5) days, Borrowers, without notice or demand by Agent, promptly shall pay to Agent, for its own account
and not for the benefit of any other Lenders, as additional compensation to Agent in administering the Obligations, an amount equal
to two percent (2.0%) of each delinquent payment.

Computation of Interest and Related Fees. All interest and fees under each Financing Document shall be calculated
on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. The date of funding of a Loan shall be included in the calculation
of interest. The date of payment of a Loan shall be excluded from the calculation of interest. If a Loan is repaid on the same
day that it is made, one (1) day's interest shall be charged.
Section 2.3
Notes. The portion of the Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced, if so requested by such Lender, by one
or more promissory notes executed by Borrowers on a joint and several basis (each, a "Note") in an original principal

one or more Letters of Credit and (ii) a Lender, identified by Agent, as an LC Issuer, of one or more Lender Letters of Credit,

Lender. Each Lender that is an LC Issuer hereby agrees to give Agent prompt written notice of each issuance of a Lender Letter

Notwithstanding

available for the issuance of a Letter of Credit until such times as Agent notifies Borrower Representative that a Lender party
to this Agreement is an LC Issuer.
(b)
Letter of Credit Fee. Borrowers shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares, a letter of credit fee with respect to the Letter of Credit Liabilities for each Letter of Credit,

and on such date. In addition, Borrowers agree to pay promptly to the LC Issuer any fronting or other fees that it may charge in
connection with any Letter of Credit.
(c)
Reimbursement Obligations of Borrowers. If either (i) Agent shall make a payment to an LC Issuer pursuant to a Support
Agreement, or (ii) any Lender shall notify Agent that it has made payment in respect of, a Lender Letter of Credit, (A) the applicable
Borrower shall reimburse Agent or such Lender, as applicable, for the amount of such payment by the end of the day on which Agent
or such Lender shall make such payment and (B) Borrowers shall be deemed to have immediately requested that Revolving Lenders make
a Revolving Loan, in a principal amount equal to the amount of such payment (but solely to the extent such Borrower shall have
failed to directly reimburse Agent or, with respect to Lender Letters of Credit, the applicable LC Issuer, for the amount of such
payment). Agent shall promptly notify Revolving Lenders of any such deemed request and each Revolving Lender hereby agrees to make
available to Agent not later than noon (Eastern time) on the Business Day following such notification from Agent such Revolving
Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Revolving Loan. Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to fund such
Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Loan described in the immediately preceding sentence, unaffected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including, without limitation, (x) the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default, (y) the fact that, whether
before or after giving effect to the making of any such Revolving Loan, the Revolving Loan Outstandings exceed or will exceed the
Revolving Loan Limit, and/or (z) the non-satisfaction of any conditions set forth in Section 7.2. Agent hereby agrees to apply
the gross proceeds of each Revolving Loan deemed made pursuant to this Section 2.5(c) in satisfaction of Borrowers' reimbursement
obligations arising pursuant to this Section 2.5(c). Borrowers shall pay interest, on demand, on all amounts so paid by Agent pursuant
to any Support Agreement or to any applicable Lender in honoring a draw request under any Lender Letter of Credit for each day
from the date of such payment until Borrowers reimburse Agent or the applicable Lender therefor (whether pursuant to clause (A)
or (B) of the first sentence of this subsection (c)) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of two percent (2%) plus the interest
rate applicable to Revolving Loans for such day.

LC Issuer pursuant to Section 2.5(c) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, under all circumstances whatsoever, including the following:
(i)
any lack of validity or enforceability of, or any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from, any Letter of
Credit or any related document;
(ii)
the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right which any Borrower may have at any time against the beneficiary
of any Letter of Credit, the LC Issuer (including any claim for improper payment), Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether
in connection with any Financing Document or any unrelated transaction, provided, however, that nothing herein shall
prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;
(iii)
any statement or any other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient
in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever;

outstanding Letter of Credit Liabilities to be available to Agent, for its benefit and the benefit of issuers of Letters of Credit,
to reimburse payments of drafts drawn under such Letters of Credit and pay any fees and expenses related thereto, and (ii) prepay
the fee payable under Section 2.5(b) with respect to such Letters of Credit for the full remaining terms of such Letters of Credit
assuming that the full amount of such Letters of Credit as of the date of such repayment or termination remain outstanding until
the end of such remaining terms. Upon termination of any such Letter of Credit and so long as no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, the unearned portion of such prepaid fee attributable to such Letter of Credit shall be refunded to Borrowers,
together with the deposit described in the preceding clause (i) attributable to such Letter of Credit, but only to the extent not
previously applied by Agent in the manner described herein.

40
 


(f)
Participations in Support Agreements and Lender Letters of Credit.
(i)
Concurrently with the issuance of each Supported Letter of Credit, Agent shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to
each Revolving Lender, and each such Revolving Lender shall be deemed irrevocably and immediately to have purchased and received
from Agent, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in, to the extent of such Lender's Pro Rata Share,
Agent's Support Agreement liabilities and obligations in respect of such Supported Letter of Credit and Borrowers' Reimbursement
Obligations with respect thereto. Concurrently with the issuance of each Lender Letter of Credit, the LC Issuer in respect thereof
shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each Revolving Lender, and each such Revolving Lender shall be deemed irrevocably
and immediately to have purchased and received from such LC Issuer, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation
in, to the extent of such Lender's Pro Rata Share, such Lender Letter of Credit and Borrowers' Reimbursement Obligations with respect
thereto. Any purchase obligation arising pursuant to the immediately two preceding sentences shall be absolute and unconditional
and shall not be affected by any circumstances whatsoever.
(ii)
If either (A) Agent makes any payment or disbursement under any Support Agreement and/or (B) an LC Issuer makes
any payment or disbursement under any Lender Letter of Credit, and (I) Borrowers have not reimbursed Agent or the applicable
LC Issuer, as applicable, in full for such payment or disbursement in accordance with Section 2.5(c), or (II) any reimbursement
under any Support Agreement or Lender Letter of Credit received by Agent or any LC Issuer, as applicable, from any Credit Party
is or must be returned or rescinded upon or during any bankruptcy or reorganization of any Credit Party or otherwise, each Revolving
Lender shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to pay to Agent or the applicable LC Issuer, as applicable, its Pro Rata
Share of such payment or disbursement (but no such payment shall diminish the Obligations of Borrowers under Section 2.5(c)). To
the extent any such Revolving Lender shall not have made such amount available to Agent or the applicable LC Issuer, as applicable,
before 12:00 Noon (Eastern time) on the Business Day on which such Lender receives notice from Agent or the applicable LC Issuer,
as applicable, of such payment or disbursement, or return or rescission, as applicable, such Lender agrees to pay interest on such
amount to Agent or the applicable LC Issuer, as applicable, forthwith on demand accruing daily at the Federal Funds Rate, for the
first three (3) days following such Lender's receipt of such notice, and thereafter at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin
in respect of Revolving Loans. Any such Revolving Lender's failure to make available to Agent or the applicable LC Issuer, as applicable,
its Pro Rata Share of any such payment or disbursement, or return or rescission, as applicable, shall not relieve any other Lender
of its obligation hereunder to make available such other Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of such payment, but no Revolving Lender
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make available such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of any such payment
or disbursement, or return or rescission.

Section 2.6
General Provisions Regarding Payment; Loan Account.
(a)
All payments to be made by each Borrower under any Financing Document, including payments of principal and interest made
hereunder and pursuant to any other Financing Document, and all fees, expenses, indemnities and reimbursements, shall be made without
set-off, recoupment or counterclaim. If any payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such
payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall
be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension (it being understood and agreed that, solely for purposes of calculating
financial covenants and computations contained herein and determining compliance therewith, if payment is made, in full, on any
such extended due date, such payment shall be deemed to have been paid on the original due date without giving effect to any extension
thereto). Any payments received in the Payment Account before 12:00 Noon (Eastern time) on any date shall be deemed received by
Agent on such date, and any payments received in the Payment Account at or after 12:00 Noon (Eastern time) on any date shall be
deemed received by Agent on the next succeeding Business Day.
(b)
Agent shall maintain a loan account (the "Loan Account") on its books to record Loans and other extensions
of credit made by Lenders hereunder or under any other Financing Document, and all payments thereon made by each Borrower. All
entries in the Loan Account shall be made in accordance with Agent's customary accounting practices as in effect from time to time.
The balance in the Loan Account, as recorded in Agent's books and records at any time shall be conclusive and binding evidence
of the amounts due and owing to Agent by each Borrower absent manifest error; provided, however, that any failure
to so record or any error in so recording shall not limit or otherwise affect any Borrower's duty to pay all amounts owing hereunder
or under any other Financing Document. Agent shall endeavor to provide Borrowers with a monthly statement regarding the Loan Account
(but neither Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability if Agent shall fail to provide any such statement). Unless any Borrower
notifies Agent of any objection to any such statement (specifically describing the basis for such objection) within ninety (90)
days after the date of receipt thereof, it shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive upon Borrowers in all respects as to all
matters reflected therein.
Section 2.7
Maximum Interest. In no event shall the interest charged with respect to the Loans or any other Obligations of
any Borrower under any Financing Document exceed the maximum amount permitted under the laws of the State of New York or of any
other applicable jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or elsewhere, if at any time the rate of interest
payable hereunder or under any Note or other Financing Document (the "Stated Rate") would exceed the highest rate
of interest permitted under any applicable law to be charged (the "Maximum Lawful Rate"), then for so long as
the Maximum Lawful Rate would be so exceeded, the rate of interest payable shall be equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate; provided,
however, that if at any time thereafter the Stated Rate is less than the Maximum Lawful Rate, each Borrower shall, to the
extent permitted by law, continue to pay interest at the Maximum Lawful Rate until such time as the total interest received is
equal to the total interest which would have been received had the Stated Rate been (but for the operation of this provision) the
interest rate payable. Thereafter, the interest rate payable shall be the Stated Rate unless and until the Stated Rate again would
exceed the Maximum Lawful Rate, in which event this provision shall again apply. In no event shall the total interest received
by any Lender exceed the amount which it could lawfully have received had the interest been calculated for the full term hereof
at the Maximum Lawful Rate. If, notwithstanding the prior sentence, any Lender has received interest hereunder in excess of the
Maximum Lawful Rate, such excess amount shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Loans or to other amounts
(other than interest) payable hereunder, and if no such principal or other amounts are then outstanding, such excess or part thereof
remaining shall be paid to Borrowers. In computing interest payable with reference to the Maximum Lawful Rate applicable to any
Lender, such interest shall be calculated at a daily rate equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate divided by the number of days in the
year in which such calculation is made.

42
 


Section 2.8
Taxes; Capital Adequacy.
(a)
All payments of principal and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Financing
Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any present or future Taxes, except as required by applicable
Law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction
or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled
to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority
in accordance with applicable Law and if any such withholding or deduction is in respect of any Indemnified Taxes, then Credit
Parties shall pay such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by Agent and
each Lender will equal the full amount Agent and such Lender would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required
(including, without limitation, such withholdings and deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.8).
After payment of any Tax by a Credit Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.8, such Credit Party shall promptly
forward to Agent the original or a certified copy of an official receipt, a copy of the return reporting such payment, or other
documentation satisfactory to Agent evidencing such payment to such authority. Borrowers shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
(b)
The Credit Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify Agent and Lenders, within ten (10) days after demand thereof, for
the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable
under this Section 2.8) payable or paid by Agent or any Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to Agent
or any Lender and any expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' and
tax advisor fees and expenses), whether or not such Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted
by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate in reasonable detail as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to Borrower Representative by a Lender (with a copy to Agent), or by Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

43
 


(i)
Each Lender that is not a "United States person" (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is a party hereto on the Closing Date or purports to become an assignee of an interest
pursuant to Section 11.17(a) after the Closing Date (unless such Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to
such assignment) (each such Lender a "Foreign Lender") shall, to the extent permitted by Law, execute and deliver
to Borrower Representative and Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date
on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request
of the Borrower Representative or Agent) whichever of the following is applicable: (A) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming
the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, (x) with respect to payments of interest under
any Financing Document, two (2) properly completed and executed originals of United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS")
Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant
to the "interest" article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Financing
Documents, two (2) properly completed and executed originals of IRS Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) establishing
an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to the "business profits" or "other income"
article of such tax treaty; (B) two (2) executed originals of Form W-8ECI (or successor form); (C) in the case of a Foreign
Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a "bank" within the
meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a "10 percent shareholder" of any Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B)
of the Code, or a "controlled foreign corporation" described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a "U.S.
Tax Compliance Certificate") and (y) two (2) executed originals of IRS Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form);
(D) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, two (2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied
by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form
of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9 (or successor form), and/or other certification documents from
each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect
partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance
Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; or (E) other
applicable forms, certificates or documents prescribed by the IRS. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously
delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify
Borrower Representative and Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, such forms shall be delivered by each Foreign Lender upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered
by such Foreign Lender. Each Foreign Lender shall promptly notify Borrower Representative at any time it determines that it is
no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to Borrower Representative (or any other form of certification
adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose).

44
 

 
(ii)
Each Lender that is a "United States person" (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is a party hereto on the Closing Date or purports to become an assignee of an interest
pursuant to Section 11.17(a) after the Closing Date (unless such Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to
such assignment) shall, to the extent permitted by Law, provide to Borrower Representative and Agent on or prior to the date on
which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower
Representative or Agent), a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 or any successor form certifying as to such Lender's entitlement
to an exemption from U.S. backup withholding and other applicable forms, certificates or documents prescribed by the IRS or reasonably
requested by Borrower Representative or Agent. Each such Lender shall promptly notify Borrowers at any time it determines that
any certificate previously delivered to Borrower Representative (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. governmental
authorities for such purposes) is no longer valid.
(iii)
Any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower Representative and Agent (in
such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender
under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower Representative or Agent), executed
copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding
Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit Borrowers
or Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
(c)
[Reserved].
(d)
If any Lender determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund in respect of any
Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.8 (including by the payment of additional
amounts pursuant to this Section 2.8), then it shall promptly pay an amount equal to such refund to Borrowers, net of all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or of Agent with respect thereto, including any Taxes; provided, however,
that Borrowers, upon the written request of such Lender or Agent, agree to repay any amount paid over to Borrowers to such Lender
or to Agent (plus any related penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event
such Lender or Agent is required, for any reason, to disgorge or otherwise repay such refund. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 2.8, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant
to this Section 2.8(d) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than
the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted,
withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.
This Section 2.8 shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information
relating to its Taxes that it deems in good faith to be confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

45
 


(e)
If a payment made to a Lender under any Financing Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA
if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b)
or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower Representative and Agent at the time or times prescribed
by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable
Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested
by Borrower Representative or Agent as may be necessary for Borrowers and Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and
to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and
withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (e), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to
FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(f)
Each Lender shall severally indemnify Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable
to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without
limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the
provisions of Section 11.17 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to
such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by Agent in connection with any Financing Document, and any reasonable expenses
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by Agent shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender
under any Financing Document or otherwise payable by Agent to such Lender from any other source against any amount due to Agent
under this paragraph (f).
(g)
Each party's obligations under Section 2.8(a) through (f) shall survive the resignation
or replacement of Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge
of all Obligations hereunder.
(h)
If any Lender shall reasonably determine that the adoption or taking effect of, or any change in, any applicable Law regarding
capital adequacy, in each instance, after the Closing Date, or any change after the Closing Date in the interpretation, administration
or application thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation, administration
or application thereof, or the compliance by any Lender or any Person controlling such Lender with any request, guideline or directive
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of Law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable
agency adopted or otherwise taking effect after the Closing Date, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on
such Lender's or such controlling Person's capital as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder to a level below that
which such Lender or such controlling Person could have achieved but for such adoption, taking effect, change, interpretation,
administration, application or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such controlling Person's policies with respect
to capital adequacy) then from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate setting
forth the basis for such demand and a calculation of the amount thereof in reasonable detail, a copy of which shall be furnished
to Agent), Borrowers shall promptly pay to such Lender such additional amount as will compensate such Lender or such controlling
Person for such reduction, so long as such amounts have accrued on or after the day which is two hundred seventy (270) days prior
to the date on which such Lender first made demand therefor; provided that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, (i) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives
thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank
for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United
States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a "change
in applicable Law", regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.

46
 


(i)
If any Lender requests compensation under any of Section 2.1(b)(iv) or Section 2.8(h), or requires Borrowers to
pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.8,
then, upon the written request of Borrower Representative, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending
office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder (subject to the provisions
of Section 11.17) to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation
or assignment (i) would eliminate or materially reduce amounts payable pursuant to any such Section, as the case may be, in
the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous
to such Lender (as determined in its sole good faith discretion). Without limitation of the provisions of Section 12.14, each
Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection
with any such designation or assignment.
Section 2.9
Appointment of Borrower Representative.
(a)
Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints and constitutes Borrower Representative as its agent and attorney-in-fact to request
and receive Loans in the name or on behalf of such Borrower and any other Borrowers, deliver Notices of Borrowing, Notices of LC
Credit Events and Borrowing Base Certificates, give instructions with respect to the disbursement of the proceeds of the Loans,
requesting Letters of Credit, giving and receiving all other notices and consents hereunder or under any of the other Financing
Documents and taking all other actions (including in respect of compliance with covenants) in the name or on behalf of any Borrower
or Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement and the other Financing Documents. Agent and Lenders may disburse the Loans to such bank
account of Borrower Representative or a Borrower or otherwise make such Loans to a Borrower, and LC Issuer may provide such Letters
of Credit for the account of a Borrower, in each case as Borrower Representative may designate or direct, without notice to any
other Borrower. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Agent may at any time and from time to time require
that Loans to or for the account of any Borrower be disbursed directly to an operating account of such Borrower.
(b)
Borrower Representative hereby accepts the appointment by Borrowers to act as the agent and attorney-in-fact of Borrowers
pursuant to this Section 2.9. Borrower Representative shall ensure that the disbursement of any Loans that are at any time requested
by or to be remitted to or for the account of a Borrower, or the issuance of any Letter of Credit requested on behalf of a Borrower
hereunder, shall be remitted or issued to or for the account of such Borrower.

47
 


(c)
Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints and constitutes Borrower Representative as its agent to receive statements on
account and all other notices from Agent, Lenders and LC Issuer with respect to the Obligations or otherwise under or in connection
with this Agreement and the other Financing Documents.
(d)
Any notice, election, representation, warranty, agreement or undertaking made or delivered by or on behalf of any Borrower
by Borrower Representative shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made or delivered by such Borrower, as the case may be,
and shall be binding upon and enforceable against such Borrower to the same extent as if made or delivered directly by such Borrower.
(e)
No resignation by or termination of the appointment of Borrower Representative as agent and attorney-in-fact as aforesaid
shall be effective, except after ten (10) Business Days' prior written notice to Agent. If the Borrower Representative resigns
under this Agreement, Borrowers shall be entitled to appoint a successor Borrower Representative (which shall be a Borrower and
shall be reasonably acceptable to Agent as such successor). Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor Borrower Representative
hereunder, such successor Borrower Representative shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Borrower Representative
and the term "Borrower Representative" shall mean such successor Borrower Representative for all purposes of this Agreement
and the other Financing Documents, and the retiring or terminated Borrower Representative's appointment, powers and duties as Borrower
Representative shall be thereupon terminated.
Section 2.10
Joint and Several Liability; Rights of Contribution; Subordination and Subrogation.
(a)
Borrowers are defined collectively to include all Persons named as one of the Borrowers herein and Guarantors are defined
collectively to include all Persons named as one of the Guarantors herein; provided, however, that any references
herein to "any Borrower", "any Guarantor", "each Borrower", "each Guarantor" or similar
references, shall be construed as a reference to each individual Person named as one of the Borrowers or Guarantors herein. Each
Person so named shall be jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of the Credit Parties under this Agreement. Each
Credit Party, individually, expressly understands, agrees and acknowledges, that the credit facilities would not be made available
on the terms herein in the absence of the collective credit of all of the Persons named as the Credit Parties herein, the joint
and several liability of all such Persons, and the cross-collateralization of the Collateral of all such Persons. Accordingly,
each Credit Party individually acknowledges that the benefit to each of the Persons named as one of the Credit Parties as a whole
constitutes reasonably equivalent value, regardless of the amount of the credit facilities actually borrowed by, advanced to, or
the amount of Collateral provided by, any individual Borrower or other Credit Party. In addition, each entity named as one of the
Credit Parties herein hereby acknowledges and agrees that all of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, conditions,
agreements and other terms contained in this Agreement shall be applicable to and shall be binding upon and measured and enforceable
individually against each Person named as one of the Credit Parties herein as well as all such Persons when taken together. By
way of illustration, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the terms of Section 10.1 of this Agreement are to be
applied to each individual Person named as one of the Credit Parties herein (as well as to all such Persons taken as a whole),
such that the occurrence of any of the events described in Section 10.1 of this Agreement as to any Person named as one of the
Credit Parties herein shall constitute an Event of Default even if such event has not occurred as to any other Persons named as
the Credit Parties or as to all such Persons taken as a whole.

48
 


(b)
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, it is intended that the joint and several nature of the
liability of each Credit Party for the Obligations and the Liens granted by Credit Parties to secure the Obligations, not constitute
a Fraudulent Conveyance (as defined below). Consequently, Agent, Lenders and each Credit Party agree that if the liability of a
Credit Party for the Obligations, or any Liens granted by such Credit Party securing the Obligations would, but for the application
of this sentence, constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance, the liability of such Credit Party and the Liens securing such liability
shall be valid and enforceable only to the maximum extent that would not cause such liability or such Lien to constitute a Fraudulent
Conveyance, and the liability of such Credit Party and this Agreement shall automatically be deemed to have been amended accordingly.
For purposes hereof, the term "Fraudulent Conveyance" means a fraudulent conveyance under Section 548 of Chapter
11 of Title II of the Bankruptcy Code or a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under the applicable provisions of any
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or similar law of any state, nation or other governmental unit, as in effect from
time to time.
(c)
Agent is hereby authorized, without notice or demand (except as otherwise specifically required under this Agreement) and
without affecting the liability of any Credit Party hereunder, at any time and from time to time, to (i) renew, extend or
otherwise increase the time for payment of the Obligations; (ii) with the written agreement of any Borrower, change the terms
relating to the Obligations or otherwise modify, amend or change the terms of any Note or other agreement, document or instrument
now or hereafter executed by any Borrower and delivered to Agent for any Lender; (iii) accept partial payments of the Obligations;
(iv) in accordance with the exercise of its rights as provided in the Financing Documents and/or applicable law, take and hold
any Collateral for the payment of the Obligations or for the payment of any guaranties of the Obligations and exchange, enforce,
waive and release any such Collateral; (v)  in accordance with the exercise of its rights as provided in the Financing Documents
and/or applicable law, apply any such Collateral and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as Agent, in its sole discretion,
may determine; and (vi) in accordance with the exercise of its rights as provided in the Financing Documents and/or applicable
law, settle, release, compromise, collect or otherwise liquidate the Obligations and any Collateral therefor in any manner, all
guarantor and surety defenses being hereby waived by each Credit Party. Without limitations of the foregoing, with respect to the
Obligations, each Borrower hereby makes and adopts each of the agreements and waivers set forth in each Guarantee, the same being
incorporated hereby by reference. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents, Agent
shall have the exclusive right to determine the time and manner of application of any payments or credits, whether received from
any Credit Party or any other source, and such determination shall be binding on all Credit Parties. All such payments and credits
may be applied, reversed and reapplied, in whole or in part, to any of the Obligations that Agent shall determine, in its sole
discretion, without affecting the validity or enforceability of the Obligations of the other Credit Party.

49
 


(d)
Each Credit Party hereby agrees that, except as hereinafter provided, its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional,
irrespective of (i) the absence of any attempt to collect the Obligations from any obligor or other action to enforce the
same; (ii) the waiver or consent by Agent with respect to any provision of any instrument evidencing the Obligations, or any
part thereof, or any other agreement heretofore, now or hereafter executed by a Credit Party and delivered to Agent; (iii) failure
by Agent to take any steps to perfect and maintain its security interest in, or to preserve its rights to, any security or collateral
for the Obligations; (iv) the institution of any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar proceeding, by or against
a Credit Party or Agent's election in any such proceeding of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (v) any
borrowing or grant of a security interest by a Credit Party as debtor-in-possession, under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code;
(vi) the disallowance, under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, of all or any portion of Agent's claim(s) for repayment of
any of the Obligations; or (vii) any other circumstance other than payment in full of the Obligations which might otherwise
constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor or surety.
(e)
The Credit Parties hereby agree, as between themselves, that to the extent that Agent, on behalf of Lenders, shall have
received from any Credit Party any Recovery Amount (as defined below), then the paying Credit Party shall have a right of contribution
against each other Credit Party in an amount equal to such other Credit Party's contributive share of such Recovery Amount; provided,
however, that in the event any Credit Party suffers a Deficiency Amount (as defined below), then the Credit Party suffering
the Deficiency Amount shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against the other Credit Parties in an amount
equal to the Deficiency Amount; and provided, further, that in no event shall the aggregate amounts so reimbursed
by reason of the contribution of any Credit Party equal or exceed an amount that would, if paid, constitute or result in Fraudulent
Conveyance. Until all Obligations have been paid and satisfied in full, no payment made by or for the account of a Credit Party
including, without limitation, (i) a payment made by such Credit Party on behalf of the lia

de by any other Guarantor under any Guarantee, shall entitle such Credit Party, by subrogation or otherwise,
to any payment from such other Credit Party or from or out of such other Credit Party's property. The right of each Credit Party
to receive any contribution under this Section 2.10(e) or by subrogation or otherwise from any other Credit Party shall be subordinate
in right of payment to the Obligations and such Credit Party shall not exercise any right or remedy against such other Credit Party
or any property of such other Credit Party by reason of any performance of such Credit Party of its joint and several obligations
hereunder, until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and satisfied in full, and no Credit Party shall exercise any right
or remedy with respect to this Section 2.10(e) until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and satisfied in full. As used
in this Section 2.10(e), the term "Recovery Amount" means the amount of proceeds received by or credited to Agent
from the exercise of any remedy of Lenders under this Agreement or the other Financing Documents, including, without limitation,
the sale of any Collateral. As used in this Section 2.10(e), the term "Deficiency Amount" means any amount that
is less than the entire amount a Credit Party is entitled to receive by way of contribution or subrogation from, but that has not
been paid by, the other Credit Parties in respect of any Recovery Amount attributable to the Credit Party entitled to contribution,
until the Deficiency Amount has been reduced to $0 through contributions and reimbursements made under the terms of this Section
2.10(e) or otherwise.

(f)
Each Qualified ECP Credit Party hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide
such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Credit Party to honor all of its obligations under
this Section 2.10 in respect of Swap Obligations. The obligations of each Qualified ECP Credit Party under this Section 2.10 shall
remain in full force and effect until the Commitments are terminated, all Letters of Credit have expired or been cancelled, replaced,
backstopped or cash collateralized, and all Obligations payable by the Borrowers and the Guarantors under this Agreement and all
other Financing Documents shall have been paid in full. Each Qualified ECP Credit Party intends that this Section 2.10(f) constitute,
and this Section 2.10(f) shall be deemed to constitute, a "keepwell, support, or other agreement" for the benefit of
each other Credit Party for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
Section 2.11
Collections and Lockbox Account.
(a)
Borrowers shall maintain a lockbox (the "Lockbox") with a United States depository institution designated
from time to time by Agent (the "Lockbox Bank"), subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and shall execute
with the Lockbox Bank a Deposit Account Control Agreement and such other agreements related to such Lockbox as Agent may require.
Borrowers shall ensure that all collections of Accounts are paid directly from Account Debtors (i) into the Lockbox for deposit
into the Lockbox Account and/or (ii) directly into the Lockbox Account; provided, however, unless Agent shall
otherwise direct by written notice to Borrowers, Borrowers shall be permitted to cause Account Debtors who are individuals to pay
Accounts directly to Borrowers, which Borrowers shall then administer and apply in the manner required below. All funds deposited
into a Lockbox Account shall be transferred into the Payment Account by the close of each Business Day.
(b)
[Reserved]
(c)
Notwithstanding anything in any lockbox agreement or Deposit Account Control Agreement to the contrary, Borrowers agree
that they shall be liable for any fees and charges in effect from time to time and charged by the Lockbox Bank in connection with
the Lockbox, the Lockbox Account, and that Agent shall have no liability therefor. Borrowers hereby indemnify and agree to hold
Agent harmless from any and all liabilities, claims, losses and demands whatsoever, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses,
arising from or relating to actions of Agent or the Lockbox Bank pursuant to this Section or any lockbox agreement or Deposit Account
Control Agreement or similar agreement, except to the extent of such losses arising solely from Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct.
(d)
Agent shall apply, on a daily basis, all funds transferred into the Payment Account pursuant to this Section to reduce the
outstanding Revolving Loans in such order of application as Agent shall elect. If as the result of collections of Accounts pursuant
to the terms and conditions of this Section, a credit balance exists with respect to the Loan Account, such credit balance shall
not accrue interest in favor of Borrowers, but Agent shall transfer such funds into an account designated by Borrower Representative
for so long as no Event of Default exists.

51
 


(e)
To the extent that any collections of Accounts or proceeds of other Collateral are not sent directly to the Lockbox or Lockbox
Account but are received by any Borrower, such collections shall be held in trust for the benefit of Agent pursuant to an express
trust created hereby and immediately remitted, in the form received, to applicable Lockbox or Lockbox Account. No such funds received
by any Borrower shall be commingled with other funds of the Borrowers.
(f)
Borrowers acknowledge and agree that compliance with the terms of this Section is essential, and that Agent and Lenders
will suffer immediate and irreparable injury and have no adequate remedy at law, if any Borrower, through acts or omissions, causes
or permits Account Debtors to send payments other than to the Lockbox or Lockbox Accounts or if any Borrower fails to promptly
deposit collections of Accounts or proceeds of other Collateral in the Lockbox Account as herein required. Accordingly, in addition
to all other rights and remedies of Agent and Lenders hereunder, Agent shall have the right to seek specific performance of the
Borrowers' obligations under this Section, and any other equitable relief as Agent may deem necessary or appropriate, and Borrowers
waive any requirement for the posting of a bond in connection with such equitable relief.
(g)
Borrowers shall not, and Borrowers shall not suffer or permit any Credit Party to, (i) withdraw any amounts from any
Lockbox Account, (ii) change the procedures or sweep instructions under the agreements governing any Lockbox Accounts, or
(iii) send to or deposit in any Lockbox Account any funds other than payments made with respect to and proceeds of Accounts
or other Collateral. Borrowers shall, and shall cause each Credit Party to, cooperate with Agent in the identification and reconciliation
on a daily basis of all amounts received in or required to be deposited into the Lockbox Accounts. If more than five percent (5%)
of the collections of Accounts received by Borrowers during any given calendar month period is not identified or reconciled to
the reasonable satisfaction of Agent within ten (10) Business Days of receipt, Agent shall not be obligated to make further advances
under this Agreement until such amount is identified or is reconciled to the reasonable satisfaction of Agent, as the case may
be. In addition, if any such amount cannot be identified or reconciled to the reasonable satisfaction of Agent, Agent may utilize
its own staff or, if it reasonably deems necessary, engage an outside auditor, in either case at Borrowers' expense (which in the
case of Agent's own staff shall be in accordance with Agent's then prevailing customary charges (plus reasonable expenses)), to
make such examination and report as may be necessary to identify and reconcile such amount.
(h)
If any Borrower breaches its obligation to direct payments of the proceeds of the Collateral to the Lockbox Account, Agent,
as the irrevocably made, constituted and appointed true and lawful attorney for Borrowers, may, by the signature or other act of
any of Agent's authorized representatives (without requiring any of them to do so), direct any Account Debtor to pay proceeds of
the Collateral to Borrowers by directing payment to the Lockbox Account.

52
 


Section 2.12
Termination; Restriction on Termination.
(a)
Termination by Lenders. In addition to the rights set forth in Section 10.2, Agent may, and at the direction of Required
Lenders shall, terminate this Agreement without notice upon or after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default.
(b)
Termination by Borrowers. Upon at least ten (10) days' prior written notice to Agent and Lenders, Borrowers may,
at its option, terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that no such termination shall be effective until Borrowers
have (i) paid or collateralized to Agent's satisfaction all of the Obligations in immediately available funds, all Letters
of Credit and Support Agreements have expired, terminated or have been cash collateralized to Agent's satisfaction, and (ii) complied
with Section 2.2(f). Any notice of termination given by Borrowers shall be irrevocable unless all Lenders otherwise agree in writing
and no Lender shall have any obligation to make any Loans or issue or procure any Letters of Credit or Support Agreements on or
after the termination date stated in such notice. Borrowers may elect to terminate this Agreement in its entirety only. No section
of this Agreement or type of Loan available hereunder may be terminated singly.
(c)
Effectiveness of Termination. All of the Obligations shall be immediately due and payable upon the Termination Date.
All undertakings, agreements, covenants, warranties and representations of Borrowers contained in the Financing Documents shall
survive any such termination and Agent shall retain its Liens in the Collateral and Agent and each Lender shall retain all of its
rights and remedies under the Financing Documents notwithstanding such termination until all Obligations have been discharged or
paid, in full, in immediately available funds, including, without limitation, all Obligations under Section 2.2(f) and the terms
of any fee letter resulting from such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing or the payment in full of the Obligations, Agent
shall not be required to terminate its Liens in the Collateral unless, with respect to any loss or damage Agent may incur as a
result of dishonored checks or other items of payment received by Agent from Borrower or any Account Debtor and applied to the
Obligations, Agent shall, at its option, (i) have received a written agreement satisfactory to Agent, executed by Borrowers
and by any Person whose loans or other advances to Borrowers are used in whole or in part to satisfy the Obligations, indemnifying
Agent and each Lender from any such loss or damage or (ii) have retained cash Collateral or other Collateral for such period
of time as Agent, in its discretion, may reasonably deem necessary to protect Agent and each Lender from any such loss or damage.
ARTICLE 3 - REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES
To induce Agent
and Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans and other credit accommodations contemplated hereby, each Borrower
hereby represents and warrants to Agent and each Lender that:
Section 3.1
Existence and Power. Each Credit Party is an entity as specified on Schedule 3.1, is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction specified on Schedule 3.1 and no other jurisdiction, has
the same legal name as it appears in such Credit Party's Organizational Documents and an organizational identification number (if
any), in each case as specified on Schedule 3.1, and has all powers and all Permits necessary or desirable in the operation
of its business as presently conducted or as proposed to be conducted, except where the failure to have such Permits would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Credit Party is qualified to do business as a foreign entity in
each jurisdiction in which it is required to be so qualified, which jurisdictions as of the Closing Date are specified on Schedule
3.1, except where the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Ef

eement or instrument binding upon it, except for
such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults as would not, with respect to this clause (b), reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.
Section 3.3
Binding Effect. Each of the Financing Documents to which any Credit Party is a party constitutes a valid and
binding agreement or instrument of such Credit Party, enforceable against such Credit Party in accordance with its respective terms,
except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws relating to the enforcement
of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles.
Section 3.4
Capitalization. The authorized equity securities of each of the Credit Parties as of the Closing Date are as
set forth on Schedule 3.4. All issued and outstanding equity securities of each of the Credit Parties are duly authorized
and validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, free and clear of all Liens other than those in favor of Agent for the benefit of
Agent and Lenders, and such equity securities were issued in compliance with all applicable Laws. The identity of the holders of
the equity securities of each of the Credit Parties and the percentage of their fully-diluted ownership of the equity securities
of each of the Credit Parties as of the Closing Date is set forth on Schedule 3.4. No shares of the capital stock or other
equity securities of any Credit Party, other than those described above, are issued and outstanding as of the Closing Date. Except
as set forth on Schedule 3.4, as of the Closing Date there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants,
conversion rights or similar agreements or understandings for the purchase or acquisition from any Credit Party of any equity securities
of any such entity.
Section 3.5
Financial Information. All information delivered to Agent and pertaining to the financial condition of any Credit
Party fairly presents the financial position of such Credit Party as of such date in conformity with GAAP (and as to unaudited
financial statements, subject to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of footnote disclosures). Since July 31, 2019, there
has been no material adverse change in the business, operations, properties, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of
any Credit Party.

54
 


Section 3.6
Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.6 as of the Closing Date, and except as hereafter disclosed
to Agent in writing, there is no Litigation pending against, or, to any Borrower's knowledge, threatened against or affecting any
Credit Party. There is no Litigation pending in which an adverse decision would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect or which in any manner draws into question the validity of any of the Financing Documents.
Section 3.7
Ownership of Property. Each Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is the lawful owner of, has good and marketable
title to and is in lawful possession of, or has valid leasehold interests in, all properties and other assets (real or personal,
tangible, intangible or mixed) purported or reported to be owned or leased (as the case may be) by such Person.
Section 3.8
No Default. No Event of Default, or to Borrowers' knowledge no Default, has occurred and is continuing. No Credit
Party is in breach or default under or with respect to any contract, agreement, lease or other instrument to which it is a party
or by which its property is bound or affected, which breach or default would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.
Section 3.9
Labor Matters. As of the Closing Date, there are no strikes or other labor disputes pending or, to any Borrower's
knowledge, threatened against any Credit Party. Except to the extent such violations would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (a) hours worked and payments made to the employees of the Credit
Parties have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Law dealing with such matters, and (b)
all payments due from the Credit Parties, or for which any claim may be made against any of them, on account of wages and employee
and retiree health and welfare insurance and other benefits have been paid or accrued as a liability on their books, as the case
may be. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Financing Documents will not give rise to a right of termination
or right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which it is a party or by which
it is bound.
Section 3.10
Regulated Entities. No Credit Party is an "investment company" o

to a Permitted Contest, the amounts
shown thereon to be due and payable have been paid in full or adequate provisions therefor have been made.
Section 3.14
Compliance with ERISA.
(a)
Each ERISA Plan (and the related trusts and funding agreements) complies in form and in operation with, has been administered
in compliance with, and the terms of each ERISA Plan satisfy, the applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code and all other applicable
laws in all material respects. Each ERISA Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified,
and the United States Internal Revenue Service has issued a favorable determination letter or opinion letter with respect to each
such ERISA Plan which may be relied on currently. No Credit Party has incurred liability for any material excise tax under any
of Sections 4971 through 5000A of the Code.
(b)
Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Borrower
and each Subsidiary is in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the provision of the Code and all other applicable
laws relating to ERISA Plans and the regulations and published interpretations therein. During the thirty-six (36) month period
prior to the Closing Date or the making of any Loan or the issuance of any Letter of Credit, (i) no steps have been taken
to terminate any Pension Plan, and (ii) no contribution failure has occurred with respect to any Pension Plan sufficient to
give rise to a Lien under Section 303(k) of ERISA or Section 430(k) of the Code. No condition exists or event or transaction has
occurred with respect to any Pension Plan which could result in the incurrence by any Credit Party of any material liability, fine
or penalty. No Credit Party has incurred liability to the PBGC (other than for current premiums) with respect to any employee Pension
Plan. All contributions (if any) have been made on a timely basis to any Multiemployer Plan that ar

 terms of the plan or of any collective bargaining agreement
or by applicable Law; no Credit Party nor any member of the Controlled Group has withdrawn or partially withdrawn from any Multiemployer
Plan, incurred any withdrawal liability with respect to any such plan or received notice of any claim or demand for withdrawal
liability or partial withdrawal liability from any such plan, and no condition has occurred which, if continued, could result in
a withdrawal or partial withdrawal from any such plan, and no Credit Party nor any member of the Controlled Group has received
any notice that any Multiemployer Plan is insolvent, that increased contributions may be required to avoid a reduction in plan
benefits or the imposition of any excise tax, that any such plan is or has been funded at a rate less than that required under
Section 412 of the Code or that any such plan is or may be terminated.

56
 


Section 3.15
Consummation of Financing Documents; Brokers. Except for fees payable to Agent and/or Lenders, no broker, finder
or other intermediary has brought about the obtaining, making or closing of the transactions contemplated by the Financing Documents,
and no Credit Party has or will have any obligation to any Person in respect of any finder's or brokerage fees, commissions or
other expenses in connection herewith or therewith.
Section 3.16
Related Transactions. All transactions contemplated by the Financing Documents to be consummated on or prior
to the date hereof have been so consummated (including, without limitation, the disbursement and transfer of all funds in connection
therewith) in all material respects pursuant to the provisions of the applicable Financing Documents, true and complete copies
of which have been delivered to Agent, and in compliance with all applicable Law, except for such Laws the noncompliance with which
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Section 3.17
Material Contracts. Except for the Financing Documents and the other agreements set forth on Schedule 3.17
(collectively with the Financing Documents, the "Material Contracts"), as of the Closing Date there are no (a) employment
agreements covering the management of any Credit Party, (b) collective bargaining agreements or other similar labor agreements
covering any employees of any Credit Party, (c) agreements for managerial, consulting or similar services to which any Credit
Party is a party or by which it is bound, (d) agreements regarding any Credit Party, its assets or operations or any investment
therein to which any of its equity holders is a party or by which it is bound, (e) real estate leases, Intellectual Property
licenses or other lease or license agreements to which any Credit Party is a party, either as lessor or lessee, or as licensor
or licensee (other than licenses arising from the purchase of "off the shelf" products), (f) customer, distribution,
marketing or supply agreements to which any Credit Party is a party, in each case with respect to the preceding clauses (a) through
(f) requiring payment of more than $1,000,000 in any year, (g) partnership agreements to which any Credit Party is a general
partner or joint venture agreements to which any Credit Party is a party, (h) third party billing arrangements to which any
Credit Party is a party, or (i) any other agreements or instruments to which any Credit Party is a party, and the breach,
nonperformance or cancellation of which, or the failure of which to renew, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Schedule 3.17 sets forth, with respect to each real estate lease agreement to which any Borrower is a party (as
a lessee) as of the Closing Date, the address of the subject property and the annual rental (or, where applicable, a general description
of the method of computing the annual rental). The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Financing Documents will
not give rise to a right of termination in favor of any party to any Material Contract (other than any Credit Party), except for
such Material Contracts the noncompliance with which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

57
 


Section 3.18
Compliance with Environmental Requirements; No Hazardous Materials. Except in each case as set forth on Schedule
3.18 or as otherwise would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect:
(a)
no notice, notification, demand, request for information, citation, summons, complaint or order has been issued, no complaint
has been filed, no penalty has been assessed and no investigation or review is pending, or to any Borrower's knowledge, threatened
by any Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to any (i) alleged violation by any Credit Party of any Environmental
Law, (ii) alleged failure by any Credit Party to have any Permits required in connection with the conduct of its business
or to comply with the terms and conditions thereof, (iii) any generation, treatment, storage, recycling, transportation or
disposal of any Hazardous Materials, or (iv) release of Hazardous Materials; and
(b)
no property now owned or leased by any Credit Party and, to the knowledge of each Borrower, no such property previously
owned or leased by any Credit Party, to which any Credit Party has, directly or indirectly, transported or arranged for the transportation
of any Hazardous Materials, is listed or, to any Borrower's knowledge, proposed for listing, on the National Priorities List promulgated
pursuant to CERCLA, or CERCLIS (as defined in CERCLA) or any similar state list or is the subject of federal, state or local enforcement
actions or, to the knowledge of any Borrower, other investigations which may lead to claims against any Credit Party for clean-up
costs, remedial work, damage to natural resources or personal injury claims, including, without limitation, claims under CERCLA.
For purposes of
this Section 3.18, each Credit Party shall be deemed to include any business or business entity (including a corporation) that
is, in whole or in part, a predecessor of such Credit Party.
Section 3.19
Intellectual Property. Each Credit Party owns, is licensed to use or otherwise has the right to use, all Intellectual
Property that is material to the condition (financial or other), business or operations of such Credit Party. All Intellectual
Property existing as of the Closing Date which is issued, registered or pending with any United States or foreign Governmental
Authority (including, without limitation, any and all applications for the registration of any Intellectual Property with any such
United States or foreign Governmental Authority) and all licenses under which any Borrower is the licensee of any such registered
Intellectual Property (or any such application for the registration of Intellectual Property) owned by another Person are set forth
on Schedule 3.19. Such Schedule 3.19 indicates in each case whether such registered Intellectual Property (or application
therefor) is owned or licensed by such Credit Party, and in the case of any such licensed registered Intellectual Property (or
application therefor), lists the name and address of the licensor and the name and date of the agreement pursuant to which such
item of Intellectual Property is licensed and whether or not such license is an exclusive license and indicates whether there are
any purported restrictions in such license on the ability to such Credit Party to grant a security interest in and/or to transfer
any of its rights as a licensee under such license. Except as indicated on Schedule 3.19, the applicable Credit Party is
the sole and exclusive owner of the entire and unencumbered right, title and interest in and to each such registered Intellectual
Property (or application therefor) purported to be owned by such Credit Party, free and clear of any Liens and/or licenses in favor
of third parties or agreements or covenants not to sue such third parties for infringement. All registered Intellectual Property
of each Credit Party is duly and properly registered, filed or issued in the appropriate office and jurisdictions for such registrations,
filings or issuances, except where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
Credit Party is party to, nor bound by, any material license or other agreement with respect to which any Credit Party is the licensee
that prohibits or otherwise restricts such Credit Party from granting a security interest in such Credit Party's interest in such
license or agreement or other property. To each Borrower's knowledge, each Credit Party conducts its business without infringement
or claim of infringement of any Intellectual Property rights of others and there is no infringement or claim of infringement by
others of any Intellectual Property rights of any Credit Party, which infringement or claim of infringement would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

58
 


Section 3.20
Solvency. Each Borrower and each other Credit Party is Solvent.
Section 3.21
Full Disclosure. None of the written information (financial or otherwise) furnished by or on behalf of any Credit
Party to Agent or any Lender in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Financing Documents, contains
any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein or
therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made. All financial projections delivered
to Agent and Lenders by Borrowers (or their agents) have been prepared on the basis of the assumptions stated therein. Such projections
represent Borrowers' best estimate of such Borrower's future financial performance and such assumptions are believed by such Borrower
to be fair and reasonable in light of current business conditions; provided, however, that Borrowers can give no
assurance that such projections will be attained.
Section 3.22
Interest Rate. The rate of interest paid hereunder and the method and manner of the calculation thereof do not
violate any usury or other law or applicable Laws or any of the Organizational Documents.
Section 3.23
Subsidiaries. The Borrowers do not own any stock, partnership interests, limited liability company interests
or other equity securities except for Permitted Investments.
Section 3.24
Certain Subsidiaries and Affiliates of Borrowers. Neither (i) ModusLink Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, (ii) SalesLink LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, nor (iii) any of the Ireland Subsidiaries engages in any operations
or business, has any material liabilities, or owns any material assets.

(c)
Each Borrower will maintain (i) casualty insurance on all real and personal property on an all risks basis (including
the perils of flood, windstorm and quake), covering the repair and replacement cost of all such property and coverage, business
interruption and rent loss coverages with extended period of indemnity (for the period reasonably required by Agent from time to
time) and indemnity for extra expense, in each case without application of coinsurance and with agreed amount endorsements, (ii) general
and professional liability insurance, and (iii) such other insurance coverage in such amounts and with respect to such risks
as Agent may reasonably request from time to time; provided, however, that, in no event shall such insurance be in
amounts or with coverage materially less than, or with carriers with qualifications materially inferior to, any of the insurance
or carriers in existence as of the Closing Date (or required to be in existence after the Closing Date under a Financing Document).
All such insurance shall be provided by insurers having an A.M. Best policyholders rating reasonably acceptable to Agent. A true
and complete listing of such insurance as of the Closing Date, including issuers, coverages and deductibles, is attached hereto
as Schedule 4.4.

61
 


(d)
On or prior to the Closing Date, and at all times thereafter, Borrowers will cause Agent to be named as an additional insured,
assignee and lender loss payee (which shall include, as applicable, identification as mortgagee), as applicable, on each insurance
policy required to be maintained pursuant to this Section 4.4 pursuant to endorsements in form and substance acceptable to
Agent. Borrowers shall deliver to Agent and Lenders (i) on the Closing Date, a certificate from Borrowers' insurance broker
dated such date showing the amount of coverage as of such date, and that such policies will include effective waivers (whether
under the terms of any such policy or otherwise) by the insurer of all claims for insurance premiums against all loss payees and
additional insureds and all rights of subrogation against all loss payees and additional insureds, and that if all or any part
of such policy is canceled, terminated or expires, the insurer will forthwith give notice thereof to each additional insured, assignee
and loss payee and that no cancellation, reduction in amount or material change in coverage thereof shall be effective until at
least thirty (30) days after receipt by each additional insured, assignee and loss payee of written notice thereof, (ii) on
an annual basis, and upon the reasonable request of any Lender through Agent from time to time full information as to the insurance
carried, (iii) within five (5) days of receipt of notice from any insurer, a copy of any notice of cancellation, nonrenewal
or material change in coverage from that existing on the date of this Agreement, (iv) forthwith, notice of any cancellation
or nonrenewal of coverage, and (v) at least thirty (30) days prior to expiration of any policy of insurance, evidence of renewal
of such insurance upon the terms and conditions herein required.
(e)
In the event Borrowers fail to provide Agent with evidence of the insurance coverage required by this Agreement, Agent may,
upon at least one Business Day prior notice to Borrowers, purchase insurance at Borrowers' expense to protect Agent's interests
in the Collateral. This insurance may, but need not, protect such Borrowers' interests. The coverage purchased by Agent may not
pay any claim made by a Credit Party or any claim that is made against such Credit Party in connection with the Collateral. Borrowers
may later cancel any insurance purchased by Agent, but only after providing Agent with evidence that such Credit Party has obtained
insurance as required by this Agreement. If Agent purchases insurance for the Collateral, Borrowers will be responsible for the
costs of that insurance to the fullest extent provided by law, including interest and other charges imposed by Agent in connection
with the placement of the insurance, until the effective date of the cancellation or expiration of the insurance. The costs of
the insurance may be added to the Obligations. The costs of the insurance may be more than the cost of insurance Borrowers are
able to obtain on their own.
Section 4.5
Compliance with Laws and Material Contracts. Each Borrower will comply, and cause each Subsidiary to comply,
with the requirements of all applicable Laws and Material Contracts, except to the extent that failure to so comply would not reasonably
be expected to (a) have a Material Adverse Effect, or (b) result in any Lien upon either (i) a material portion
of the assets of any such Person in favor of any Governmental Authority, or (ii) any Collateral which is part of the Borrowing
Base.

and the Collateral, to verify the amount and age of the Accounts, the identity and credit of the respective Account Debtors, to
review the billing practices of Borrowers and to discuss their respective affairs, finances and accounts with their respective
officers, employees and independent public accountants as often as may reasonably be desired. In the absence of a Default or an
Event of Default, Agent or any Lender exercising any rights pursuant to this Section 4.6 shall give the applicable Borrower or
any applicable Subsidiary at least 5 Business Days' prior notice of such exercise and conduct any such visit or inspection during
regular business hours. No notice or restriction on access time for visits and inspections shall be required during the existence

giving particulars of such modification, and (f) that there has occurred and is then continuing no Default or if such Default

request by Agent, Borrowers, within fifteen (15) days and at their expense, will furnish Agent with a certificate, signed by a
Responsible Officer of Borrowers, updating all of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and the other
Financing Documents and certifying that all of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and the other Financing

any strikes or other labor disputes pending or, to any Borrower's knowledge, threatened against any Borrower or any Subsidiary,

Person that any Credit Party in the conduct of its business is infringing on the Intellectual Property Rights of others, and (f) of
all returns, recoveries, disputes and claims that involve more than $500,000. Borrowers represent and warrant that Schedule
4.9 sets forth a complete list of all matters existing as of the Closing Date for which notice would be required under this
Section and all litigation or governmental proceedings pending or threatened (in writing) against Borrowers or any other Credit
Party as of the Closing Date.

discharge any such assessment would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

or the time after which any private sale or other disposition of the Collateral is to be made, shall be deemed to be reasonable
notice of such sale or other disposition. If permitted by applicable law, any perishable Collateral which threatens to speedily
decline in value or which is sold on a recognized market may be sold immediately by Agent without prior notice to Credit Parties.
At any sale or disposition of Collateral, Agent may (to the extent permitted by applicable law) purchase all or any part of the
Collateral, free from any right of redemption by Credit Parties, which right is hereby waived and released. Each Borrower covenants
and agrees not to interfere with or impose any obstacle to Agent's exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral.
Agent shall have no obligation to clean-up or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale. Agent may comply with any applicable state
or federal law requirements in connection with a disposition of the Collateral and compliance will not be considered to adversely
affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral. Agent may sell the Collateral without giving any warranties
as to the Collateral. Agent may specifically disclaim any warranties of title or the like. This procedure will not be considered
to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral. If Agent sells any of the Collateral upon credit,
Credit Parties will be credited only with payments actually made by the purchaser, received by Agent and applied to the indebtedness
of the purchaser. In the event the purchaser fails to pay for the Collateral, Agent may resell the Collateral and Credit Parties
shall be credited with the proceeds of the sale. Credit Parties shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale
or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all Obligations.

82
 


(c)
Without restricting the generality of the foregoing and for the purposes aforesaid, each Credit Party hereby appoints and
constitutes Agent its lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution in the Collateral, upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, to (i) use unadvanced funds remaining under this Agreement or which may be reserved,
escrowed or set aside for any purposes hereunder at any time, or to advance funds in excess of the face amount of the Revolving
Loan Commitments, (ii) pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and claims, which may be Liens or security interests,
or to avoid such bills and claims becoming Liens against the Collateral, (iii) execute all applications and certificates in
the name of such Credit Party and to prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the Collateral, and (iv)
do any and every act which such Borrower might do in its own behalf; it being understood and agreed that this power of attorney
in this subsection (c) shall be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.
(d)
Agent and each Lender is hereby granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free license or other right to use, without charge, Credit
Parties' labels, mask works, rights of use of any name, any other Intellectual Property and advertising matter, and any similar
property as it pertains to the Collateral, in completing production of, advertising for sale, and selling any Collateral and, in
connection with Agent's exercise of its rights under this Article, Credit Parties' rights under all licenses (whether as licensor
or licensee) and all franchise agreements inure to Agent's and each Lender's benefit.
Section 10.4
Cash Collateral. If (a) any Event of Default specified in Section 10.1(e) or 10.1(f) shall occur, (b) the
Obligations shall have otherwise been accelerated pursuant to Section 10.2, or (c) the Revolving Loan Commitment and the obligations
of Agent and Lenders with respect thereto shall have been terminated pursuant to Section 10.2, then without any request or the
taking of any other action by Agent or Lenders, Borrowers shall immediately comply with the provisions of Section 2.5(e) with respect
to the deposit of cash collateral to secure the existing Letter of Credit Liability and future payment of related fees.
Section 10.5
Default Rate of Interest. At the election of Agent or Required Lenders, after the occurrence of an Event of Default
and for so long as it continues, (a) the Loans and other Obligations shall bear interest at rates that are two percent (2.0%)
per annum in excess of the rates otherwise payable under this Agreement, and (b) the fee described in Section 2.5(b) shall
increase by a rate that is two percent (2.0%) in excess of the rate otherwise payable under such Section; provided, however,
that in the case of any Event of Default specified in Section 10.1(e) or 10.1(f) above, such default rates shall apply immediately
and automatically without the need for any election or action of any kind on the part of Agent or any Lender.
Section 10.6
Setoff Rights. During the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is hereby authorized by each Credit
Party at any time or from time to time, with reasonably prompt subsequent notice to such Credit Party (any prior or contemporaneous
notice being hereby expressly waived) to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all (a) balances held by such Lender
or any of such Lender's Affiliates at any of its offices for the account of such Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries (regardless
of whether such balances are then due to such Credit Party or its Subsidiaries), and (b) other property at any time held or
owing by such Lender to or for the credit or for the account of such Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries, against and on account
of any of the Obligations; except that no Lender shall exercise any such right without the prior written consent of Agent. Any
Lender exercising a right to set off shall purchase for cash (and the other Lenders shall sell) interests in each of such other
Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Obligations as would be necessary to cause all Lenders to share the amount so set off with each
other Lender in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share of the Obligations. Each Credit Party agrees, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, that any Lender and any of such Lender's Affiliates may exercise its right to set off with respect to the Obligations
as provided in this Section 10.6.

83
 


Section 10.7
Application of Proceeds.
(a)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default, each Borrower irrevocably waives the right to direct the application of any and all payments at any time or
times thereafter received by Agent from or on behalf of such Borrower or any Guarantor of all or any part of the Obligations, and,
as between Borrowers on the one hand and Agent and Lenders on the other, Agent shall have the continuing and exclusive right to
apply and to reapply any and all payments received against the Obligations in such manner as Agent may deem advisable notwithstanding
any previous application by Agent.
(b)
Subject to the other terms and conditions contained herein (including, without limitation, Section 2.11 hereof), absent
the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, Agent shall apply any and all payments received by Agent in respect of the
Obligations, and any and all proceeds of Collateral (including proceeds of any business interruption insurance policy) received
by Agent, in the following order: first, to all fees, costs, indemnities, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred
by or owing to Agent with respect to this Agreement, the other Financing Documents or the Collateral; second, to
all fees, costs, indemnities, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred by or owing to any Lender with respect to this Agreement,
the other Financing Documents or the Collateral; third, to accrued and unpaid interest on the Obligations (including
any interest which, but for the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued on such amounts); fourth, to
the principal amount of the Obligations outstanding and to provide cash collateral to secure any and all Letter of Credit Liability
and future payment of related fees, as provided for in Section 2.5(e); fifth to any other indebtedness or obligations
of Borrowers owing to Agent or any Lender under the Financing Documents; sixth, to the Obligations owing to any Eligible
Swap Counterparty in respect of any Swap Contracts; and seventh, to Borrowers (by transferring such funds into an
account designated by Borrower Representative) or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such balance. In carrying out
the foregoing, (y) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to the application
to the next succeeding category, and (z) each of the Persons entitled to receive a payment in any particular category shall
receive an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of amounts available to be applied pursuant thereto for such category.
(c)
Following the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, but absent the occurrence and continuance of an Acceleration
Event, Agent shall apply any and all payments received by Agent in respect of the Obligations, and any and all proceeds of Collateral
received by Agent, in such order as Agent may from time to time elect.

84
 


(d)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if an Acceleration Event shall have occurred, and
so long as it continues, Agent shall apply any and all payments received by Agent in respect of the Obligations, and any and all
proceeds of Collateral received by Agent, in the following order: first, to all fees, costs, indemnities, liabilities,
obligations and expenses incurred by or owing to Agent with respect to this Agreement, the other Financing Documents or the Collateral;
second, to all fees, costs, indemnities, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred by or owing to any Lender
with respect to this Agreement, the other Financing Documents or the Collateral; third, to accrued and unpaid interest
on the Obligations (including any interest which, but for the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued on such amounts);
fourth, to the principal amount of the Obligations outstanding and to provide cash collateral to secure any and all
Letter of Credit Liability and future payment of related fees, as provided for in Section 2.5(e); fifth to any other
indebtedness or obligations of Borrowers owing to Agent or any Lender under the Financing Documents; and sixth, to
the Obligations owing to any Eligible Swap Counterparty in respect of any Swap Contracts. Any balance remaining shall be delivered
to Borrowers or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such balance or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.
In carrying out the foregoing, (y) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior
to the application to the next succeeding category, and (z) each of the Persons entitled to receive a payment in any particular
category shall receive an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of amounts available to be applied pursuant thereto for such category.
Section 10.8
Waivers.
(a)
Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Credit Party
waives: (i) presentment, demand and protest, and notice of presentment, dishonor, intent to accelerate, acceleration, protest,
default, nonpayment, maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension or renewal of any or all Financing Documents, any notes,
commercial paper, accounts, contracts, documents, Instruments, Chattel Paper and Guarantees at any time held by Lenders on which
any Credit Party may in any way be liable, and hereby ratifies and confirms whatever Lenders may do in this regard; (ii) all
rights to notice and a hearing prior to Agent's or any Lender's taking possession or control of, or to Agent's or any Lender's
replevy, attachment or levy upon, any Collateral or any bond or security which might be required by any court prior to allowing
Agent or any Lender to exercise any of its remedies; and (iii) the benefit of all valuation, appraisal and exemption Laws.
Each Credit Party acknowledges that it has been advised by counsel of its choices and decisions with respect to this Agreement,
the other Financing Documents and the transactions evidenced hereby and thereby.
(b)
Each Credit Party for itself and all its successors and assigns, (i) agrees that its liability shall not be in any
manner affected by any indulgence, extension of time, renewal, waiver, or modification granted or consented to by Lender; (ii) consents
to any indulgences and all extensions of time, renewals, waivers, or modifications that may be granted by Agent or any Lender with
respect to the payment or other provisions of the Financing Documents, and to any substitution, exchange or release of the Collateral,
or any part thereof, with or without substitution, and agrees to the addition or release of any Credit Party, endorsers, guarantors,
or sureties, or whether primarily or secondarily liable, without notice to any other Credit Party and without affecting its liability
hereunder; (iii) agrees that its liability shall be unconditional and without regard to the liability of any other Credit
Party, Agent or any Lender for any tax on the indebtedness; and (iv) to the fullest extent permitted by law, expressly waives
the benefit of any statute or rule of law or equity now provided, or which may hereafter be provided, which would produce a result
contrary to or in conflict with the foregoing.

85
 


(c)
To the extent that Agent or any Lender may have acquiesced in any noncompliance with any requirements or conditions precedent
to the closing of the Loans or to any subsequent disbursement of Loan proceeds, such acquiescence shall not be deemed to constitute
a waiver by Agent or any Lender of such requirements with respect to any future disbursements of Loan proceeds and Agent may at
any time after such acquiescence require Credit Parties to comply with all such requirements. Any forbearance by Agent or Lender
in exercising any right or remedy under any of the Financing Documents, or otherwise afforded by applicable law, including any
failure to accelerate the maturity date of the Loans, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy
nor shall it serve as a novation of the Obligations or as a reinstatement of the Loans or a waiver of such right of acceleration
or the right to insist upon strict compliance of the terms of the Financing Documents. Agent's or any Lender's acceptance of payment
of any sum secured by any of the Financing Documents after the due date of such payment shall not be a waiver of Agent's and such
Lender's right to either require prompt payment when due of all other sums so secured or to declare a default for failure to make
prompt payment. The procurement of insurance or the payment of taxes or other Liens or charges by Agent as the result of an Event
of Default shall not be a waiver of Agent's right to accelerate the maturity of the Loans, nor shall Agent's receipt of any condemnation
awards, insurance proceeds, or damages under this Agreement operate to cure or waive any Credit Party's default in payment of sums
secured by any of the Financing Documents.
(d)
Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Agreement or the other Financing Documents, each Credit Party
agrees that if an Event of Default is continuing (i) Agent and Lenders shall not be subject to any "one action"
or "election of remedies" law or rule, and (ii) all Liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided to Agent
or Lenders shall remain in full force and effect until Agent or Lenders have exhausted all remedies against the Collateral and
any other properties owned by Credit Parties and the Financing Documents and other security instruments or agreements securing
the Loans have been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized upon in satisfaction of Credit Parties' obligations under the Financing
Documents.
(e)
Nothing contained herein or in any other Financing Document shall be construed as requiring Agent or any Lender to resort
to any part of the Collateral for the satisfaction of any of Credit Parties' obligations under the Financing Documents in preference
or priority to any other Collateral, and Agent may seek satisfaction out of all of the Collateral or any part thereof, in its absolute
discretion in respect of Credit Parties ' obligations under the Financing Documents. In addition, Agent shall have the right from
time to time to partially foreclose upon any Collateral in any manner and for any amounts secured by the Financing Documents then
due and payable as determined by Agent in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, the following circumstances: (i) in
the event any Credit Party defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of one or more scheduled payments of principal
and/or interest, Agent may foreclose upon all or any part of the Collateral to recover such delinquent payments, or (ii) in
the event Agent elects to accelerate less than the entire outstanding principal balance of the Loans, Agent may foreclose all or
any part of the Collateral to recover so much of the principal balance of the Loans as Lender may accelerate and such other sums
secured by one or more of the Financing Documents as Agent may elect. Notwithstanding one or more partial foreclosures, any unforeclosed
Collateral shall remain subject to the Financing Documents to secure payment of sums secured by the Financing Documents and not
previously recovered.

86
 


(f)
To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Credit Party, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives in the event
of foreclosure of any or all of the Collateral any equitable right otherwise available to any Credit Party which would require
the separate sale of any of the Collateral or require Agent or Lenders to exhaust their remedies against any part of the Collateral
before proceeding against any other part of the Collateral; and further in the event of such foreclosure each Credit Party does
hereby expressly consent to and authorize, at the option of Agent, the foreclosure and sale either separately or together of each
part of the Collateral.
Section 10.9
Injunctive Relief. The parties acknowledge and agree that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any
Credit Party's obligations under any Financing Documents, Agent and Lenders may have no adequate remedy in money damages and, accordingly,
shall be entitled to seek an injunction (including, without limitation, a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction,
writ of attachment, or order compelling an audit) against such breach or threatened breach, including, without limitation, maintaining
any cash management and collection procedure described herein. However, no specification in this Agreement of a specific legal
or equitable remedy shall be construed as a waiver or prohibition against any other legal or equitable remedies in the event of
a breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Agreement. Each Credit Party waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the requirement of the posting of any bond in connection with such injunctive relief. By joining in the Financing Documents
as a Credit Party, each Credit Party specifically joins in this Section as if this Section were a part of each Financing Document
executed by such Credit Party.
Section 10.10
Marshalling; Payments Set Aside. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets
in payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that any Borrower makes any payment or Agent enforces its Liens or Agent
or any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such enforcement or set-off is subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, or required to be repaid by anyone, then to the extent of such recovery,
the Obligations or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived
and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or set-off had not occurred.
ARTICLE 11 - AGENT
Section 11.1
Appointment and Authorization. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes Agent to enter into each
of the Financing Documents to which it is a party (other than this Agreement) on its behalf and to take such actions as Agent on
its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Financing Documents as are delegated to Agent by the terms thereof, together with
all such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Subject to the terms of Section 11.16 and to the terms of the other Financing
Documents, Agent is authorized and empowered to amend, modify, or waive any provisions of this Agreement or the other Financing
Documents on behalf of Lenders. The provisions of this Article 11 are solely for the benefit of Agent and Lenders and neither any
Borrower nor any other Credit Party shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions hereof. In performing
its functions and duties under this Agreement, Agent shall act solely as agent of Lenders and does not assume and shall not be
deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with or for any Borrower or any other Credit Party.
Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder, or under the Financing Documents, by or through its agents, servicers, trustees,
investment managers or employees.

87
 


Section 11.2
Agent and Affiliates. Agent shall have the same rights and powers under the Financing Documents as any other
Lender and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not Agent, and Agent and its Affiliates may lend
money to, invest in and generally engage in any kind of business with each Credit Party or Affiliate of any Credit Party as if
it were not Agent hereunder.
Section 11.3
Action by Agent. The duties of Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature. Agent shall not have by
reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender. Nothing in this Agreement or any of the Financing Documents
is intended to or shall be construed to impose upon Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any of the Financing
Documents except as expressly set forth herein or therein.
Section 11.4
Consultation with Experts. Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice
of such counsel, accountants or experts.
Section 11.5
Liability of Agent. Neither Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents, trustees, investment managers,
servicers or employees shall be liable to any Lender for any action taken or not taken by it in connection with the Financing Documents,
except that Agent shall be liable with respect to its specific duties set forth hereunder but only to the extent of its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct in the discharge thereof as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. Neither Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents, trustees, investment managers, servicers or employees shall
be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (a) any statement, warranty or representation made
in connection with any Financing Document or any borrowing hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants
or agreements specified in any Financing Document; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in any Financing Document;
(d) the validity, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Financing Document, any Lien purported to be created or
perfected thereby or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; (e) the existence or non-existence
of any Default or Event of Default; or (f) the financial condition of any Credit Party. Agent shall not incur any liability
by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or other writing (which may be a bank wire, facsimile or
electronic transmission or similar writing) believed by it to be genuine or to be signed by the proper party or parties. Agent
shall not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith and if any such apportionment or
distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole recourse of any Lender to whom payment was due but
not made, shall be to recover from other Lenders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to be entitled
(and such other Lenders hereby agree to return to such Lender any such erroneous payments received by them).

88
 


Section 11.6
Indemnification. Each Lender shall, in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, indemnify Agent (to the extent not
reimbursed by Borrowers) upon demand against any cost, expense (including counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action,
loss or liability (except such as result from Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) that Agent may suffer or incur in connection with the Financing Documents or any
action taken or omitted by Agent hereunder or thereunder. If any indemnity furnished to Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion
of Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts
indemnified against even if so directed by Required Lenders until such additional indemnity is furnished.
Section 11.7
Right to Request and Act on Instructions. Agent may at any time request instructions from Lenders with respect
to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this Agreement or of any of the Financing Documents Agent is permitted or desires
to take or to grant, and if such instructions are promptly requested, Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from taking
any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from any action
or withholding any approval under any of the Financing Documents until it shall have received such instructions from Required Lenders
or all or such other portion of Lenders as shall be prescribed by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall
have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or
any of the other Financing Documents in accordance with the instructions of Required Lenders (or all or such other portion of Lenders
as shall be prescribed by this Agreement) and, notwithstanding the instructions of Required Lenders (or such other applicable portion
of Lenders), Agent shall have no obligation to take any action if it believes, in good faith, that such action would violate applicable
Law or exposes Agent to any liability for which it has not received satisfactory indemnification in accordance with the provisions
of Section 11.6.
Section 11.8
Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to
enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions
in taking or not taking any action under the Financing Documents.
Section 11.9
Collateral Matters. Lenders irrevocably authorize Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to (a) release
any Lien granted to or held by Agent under any Security Document (i) upon termination of the Loan Commitment and payment in
full of all Obligations, and, to the extent required by Agent in its sole discretion, the expiration, termination or cash collateralization
(to the satisfaction of Agent) of all Swap Contracts secured, in whole or in part, by any Collateral; or (ii) constituting
property sold or disposed of as part of or in connection with any disposition permitted under any Financing Document (it being
understood and agreed that Agent may conclusively rely without further inquiry on a certificate of a Responsible Officer as to
the sale or other disposition of property being made in full compliance with the provisions of the Financing Documents); and (b) subordinate
any Lien granted to or held by Agent under any Security Document to a Permitted Lien that is allowed to have priority over the
Liens granted to or held by Agent pursuant to the definition of "Permitted Liens". Upon request by Agent at any time,
Lenders will confirm Agent's authority to release and/or subordinate particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section
11.9.

89
 


Section 11.10
Agency for Perfection. Agent and each Lender hereby appoint each other Lender as agent for the purpose of perfecting
Agent's security interest in assets which, in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code in any applicable jurisdiction, can be
perfected by possession or control. Should any Lender (other than Agent) obtain possession or control of any such assets, such
Lender shall notify Agent thereof, and, promptly upon Agent's request therefor, shall deliver such assets to Agent or in accordance
with Agent's instructions or transfer control to Agent in accordance with Agent's instructions. Each Lender agrees that it will
not have any right individually to enforce or seek to enforce any Security Document or to realize upon any Collateral for the Loan
unless instructed to do so by Agent (or consented to by Agent), it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may
be exercised only by Agent.
Section 11.11
Notice of Default. Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or
Event of Default except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to Agent for
the account of Lenders, unless Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or a Borrower referring to this Agreement,
describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". Agent will notify
each Lender of its receipt of any such notice. Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as
may be requested by Required Lenders (or all or such other portion of Lenders as shall be prescribed by this Agreement) in accordance
with the terms hereof. Unless and until Agent has received any such request, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such
action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the
best interests of Lenders.
Section 11.12
Assignment by Agent; Resignation of Agent; Successor Agent.
(a)
Agent may at any time assign its rights, powers, privileges and duties hereunder to (i) another Lender, or (ii) any
Person to whom Agent, in its capacity as a Lender, has assigned (or will assign, in conjunction with such assignment of agency
rights hereunder) 50% or more of its Loan, in each case without the consent of Lenders or Borrowers. Following any such assignment,
Agent shall give notice to Lenders and Borrowers. An assignment by Agent pursuant to this subsection (a) shall not be deemed a
resignation by Agent for purposes of subsection (b) below.
(b)
Without limiting the rights of Agent to designate an assignee pursuant to subsection (a) above, Agent may at any time give
notice of its resignation to Lenders and Borrowers. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, Required Lenders shall have
the right to appoint a successor Agent. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by Required Lenders and shall have accepted
such appointment within ten (10) Business Days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent
may on behalf of Lenders, appoint a successor Agent; provided, however, that if Agent shall notify Borrowers and
Lenders that no Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with
such notice from Agent that no Person has accepted such appointment and, from and following delivery of such notice, (i) the
retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Financing Documents, and (ii) all
payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender
directly, until such time as Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this paragraph.

90
 


(c)
Upon (i) an assignment permitted by subsection (a) above, or (ii) the acceptance of a successor's appointment
as Agent pursuant to subsection (b) above, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring (or retired) Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations
hereunder and under the other Financing Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The
fees payable by Borrowers to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between
Borrowers and such successor. After the retiring Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Financing Documents, the provisions
of this Article and Section 11.12 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent and its sub-agents in respect
of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting or was continuing to act as Agent.
Section 11.13
Payment and Sharing of Payment.
(a)
Revolving Loan Advances, Payments and Settlements; Interest and Fee Payments.
(i)
Agent shall have the right, on behalf of Revolving Lenders to disburse funds to Borrowers for all Revolving Loans requested
or deemed requested by Borrowers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Agent shall be conclusively entitled to assume, for purposes
of the preceding sentence, that each Revolving Lender, other than any Non-Funding Lenders, will fund its Pro Rata Share of all
Revolving Loans requested by Borrowers. Each Revolving Lender shall reimburse Agent on demand, in accordance with the provisions
of the immediately following paragraph, for all funds disbursed on its behalf by Agent pursuant to the first sentence of this clause
(i), or if Agent so requests, each Revolving Lender will remit to Agent its Pro Rata Share of any Revolving Loan before Agent disburses
the same to a Borrower. If Agent elects to require that each Revolving Lender make funds available to Agent, prior to a disbursement
by Agent to a Borrower, Agent shall advise each Revolving Lender by telephone, facsimile or e-mail of the amount of such Revolving
Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loan requested by such Borrower no later than noon (Eastern time) on the date of funding
of such Revolving Loan, and each such Revolving Lender shall pay Agent on such date such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
requested Revolving Loan, in same day funds, by wire transfer to the Payment Account, or such other account as may be identified
by Agent to Revolving Lenders from time to time. If any Lender fails to pay the amount of its Pro Rata Share of any funds advanced
by Agent pursuant to the first sentence of this clause (i) within one (1) Business Day after Agent's demand, Agent shall promptly
notify Borrower Representative, and Borrowers shall immediately repay such amount to Agent. Any repayment required by Borrowers
pursuant to this Section 11.13 shall be accompanied by accrued interest thereon from and including the date such amount is made
available to a Borrower to but excluding the date of payment at the rate of interest then applicable to Revolving Loans. Nothing
in this Section 11.13 or elsewhere in this Agreement or the other Financing Documents shall be deemed to require Agent to advance
funds on behalf of any Lender or to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice
any rights that Agent or any Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

91
 


(ii)
On a Business Day of each week as selected from time to time by Agent, or more frequently (including daily), if Agent so
elects (each such day being a "Settlement Date"), Agent will advise each Revolving Lender by telephone, facsimile
or e-mail of the amount of each such Revolving Lender's percentage interest of the Revolving Loan balance as of the close of business
of the Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date. In the event that payments are necessary to adjust the amount of
such Revolving Lender's actual percentage interest of the Revolving Loans to such Lender's required percentage interest of the
Revolving Loan balance as of any Settlement Date, the Revolving Lender from which such payment is due shall pay Agent, without
setoff or discount, to the Payment Account before 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the Business Day following the Settlement Date the
full amount necessary to make such adjustment. Any obligation arising pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be absolute
and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever. In the event settlement shall not have occurred by
the date and time specified in the second preceding sentence, interest shall accrue on the unsettled amount at the rate of interest
then applicable to Revolving Loans.
(iii)
On each Settlement Date, Agent shall advise each Revolving Lender by telephone, facsimile or e-mail of the amount of such
Revolving Lender's percentage interest of principal, interest and fees paid for the benefit of Revolving Lenders with respect to
each applicable Revolving Loan, to the extent of such Revolving Lender's Revolving Loan Exposure with respect thereto, and shall
make payment to such Revolving Lender before 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the Business Day following the Settlement Date of such
amounts in accordance with wire instructions delivered by such Revolving Lender to Agent, as the same may be modified from time
to time by written notice to Agent; provided, however, that, in the case such Revolving Lender is a Defaulted Lender,
Agent shall be entitled to set off the funding short-fall against that Defaulted Lender's respective share of all payments received
from any Borrower.
(iv)
On the Closing Date, Agent, on behalf of Lenders, may elect to advance to Borrowers the full amount of the initial Loans
to be made on the Closing Date prior to receiving funds from Lenders, in reliance upon each Lender's commitment to make its Pro
Rata Share of such Loans to Borrowers in a timely manner on such date. If Agent elects to advance the initial Loans to Borrower
in such manner, Agent shall be entitled to receive all interest that accrues on the Closing Date on each Lender's Pro Rata Share
of such Loans unless Agent receives such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Loans before 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing Date.

92
 


(v)
It is understood that for purposes of advances to Borrowers made pursuant to this Section 11.13, Agent will be using the
funds of Agent, and pending settlement, (A) all funds transferred from the Payment Account to the outstanding Revolving Loans
shall be applied first to advances made by Agent to Borrowers pursuant to this Section 11.13, and (B) all interest accruing
on such advances shall be payable to Agent.
(vi)
The provisions of this Section 11.13(a) shall be deemed to be binding upon Agent and Lenders notwithstanding the occurrence
of any Default or Event of Default, or any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding pertaining to any Borrower or any other Credit Party.
(b)
[Reserved].
(c)
Return of Payments.
(i)
If Agent pays an amount to a Lender under this Agreement in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or
will be received by Agent from a Borrower and such related payment is not received by Agent, then Agent will be entitled to recover
such amount from such Lender on demand without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind, together with interest accruing on
a daily basis at the Federal Funds Rate.
(ii)
If Agent determines at any time that any amount received by Agent under this Agreement must be returned to any Borrower
or paid to any other Person pursuant to any insolvency law or otherwise, then, notwithstanding any other term or condition of this
Agreement or any other Financing Document, Agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Lender. In addition,
each Lender will repay to Agent on demand any portion of such amount that Agent has distributed to such Lender, together with interest
at such rate, if any, as Agent is required to pay to any Borrower or such other Person, without setoff, counterclaim or deduction
of any kind.
(d)
Defaulted Lenders. The failure of any Defaulted Lender to make any payment required by it hereunder shall not relieve
any other Lender of its obligations to make payment, but neither any other Lender nor Agent shall be responsible for the failure
of any Defaulted Lender to make any payment required hereunder. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, a Defaulted
Lender shall not have any voting or consent rights under or with respect to any Financing Document or constitute a "Lender"
(or be included in the calculation of "Required Lenders" hereunder) for any voting or consent rights under or with respect
to any Financing Document.

93
 


(e)
Sharing of Payments. If any Lender shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by
application of setoff or otherwise) on account of any Loan (other than pursuant to the terms of Section 2.8(d)) in excess of its
Pro Rata Share of payments entitled pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 11.13, such Lender shall purchase from the
other Lenders such participations in extensions of credit made by such other Lenders (without recourse, representation or warranty)
as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with each of them;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter required to be
returned or otherwise recovered from such purchasing Lender, such portion of such purchase shall be rescinded and each Lender which
has sold a participation to the purchasing Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the ratable extent
of such return or recovery, without interest. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender
pursuant to this clause (e) may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including pursuant
to Section 10.6) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of Borrowers in the amount
of such participation). If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim
in lieu of a setoff to which this clause (e) applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect
of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of Lenders entitled under this clause (e) to share in the benefits
of any recovery on such secured claim.
Section 11.14
Right to Perform, Preserve and Protect. If any Credit Party fails to perform any obligation hereunder or under
any other Financing Document, Agent itself may, but shall not be obligated to, cause such obligation to be performed at Borrowers'
expense. Agent is further authorized by Borrowers and Lenders to make expenditures from time to time which Agent, in its reasonable
business judgment, deems necessary or desirable to (a) preserve or protect the business conducted by Borrowers, the Collateral,
or any portion thereof, and/or (b) enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Loan and other Obligations.
Each Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse Agent on demand for any and all costs, liabilities and obligations incurred by Agent pursuant
to this Section 11.14. Each Lender hereby agrees to indemnify Agent upon demand for any and all costs, liabilities and obligations
incurred by Agent pursuant to this Section 11.14, in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6.
Section 11.15
Additional Titled Agents. Except for rights and powers, if any, expressly reserved under this Agreement to any
bookrunner, arranger or to any titled agent named on the cover page of this Agreement, other than Agent (collectively, the "Additional
Titled Agents"), and except for obligations, liabilities, duties and responsibilities, if any, expressly assumed under
this Agreement by any Additional Titled Agent, no Additional Titled Agent, in such capacity, has any rights, powers, liabilities,
duties or responsibilities hereunder or under any of the other Financing Documents. Without limiting the foregoing, no Additional
Titled Agent shall have nor be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. At any time that any Lender serving as
an Additional Titled Agent shall have transferred to any other Person (other than any Affiliates) all of its interests in the Loan,
such Lender shall be deemed to have concurrently resigned as such Additional Titled Agent.

94
 


Section 11.16
Amendments and Waivers.
(a)
No provision of this Agreement or any other Financing Document may be materially amended, waived or otherwise modified unless
such amendment, waiver or other modification is in writing and is signed or otherwise approved by Borrowers, the Required Lenders
and any other Lender to the extent required under Section 11.16(b); provided, however, that Agent shall be entitled,
in its sole and absolute discretion, to provide its written consent to a proposed Swap Contract, in each case without the consent
of any other Lender.
(b)
In addition to the required signatures under Section 11.16(a), no provision of this Agreement or any other Financing Document
may be amended, waived or otherwise modified unless such amendment, waiver or other modification is in writing and is signed or
otherwise approved by the following Persons:
(i)
if any amendment, waiver or other modification would increase a Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment, by such Lender; and/or
(ii)
if the rights or duties of Agent or LC Issuer are affected thereby, by Agent and LC Issuer, as the case may be;
provided, however, that,
in each of (i) and (ii) above, no such amendment, waiver or other modification shall, unless signed or otherwise approved in writing
by all Lenders directly affected thereby, (A) reduce the principal of, rate of interest on or any fees with respect to any
Loan or Reimbursement Obligation or forgive any principal, interest (other than default interest) or fees (other than late charges)
with respect to any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation; (B) postpone the date fixed for, or waive, any payment (other than any
mandatory prepayment pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(ii)) of principal of any Loan or of any Reimbursement Obligation, or of interest
on any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation (other than default interest) or any fees provided for hereunder (other than late charges)
or postpone the date of termination of any commitment of any Lender hereunder; (C) change the definition of the term Required
Lenders or the percentage of Lenders which shall be required for Lenders to take any action hereunder; (D) release all or
substantially all of the Collateral, authorize any Borrower to sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Collateral
or release any Guarantor of all or any portion of the Obligations or its Guarantee obligations with respect thereto, except, in
each case with respect to this clause (D), as otherwise may be provided in this Agreement or the other Financing Documents (including
in connection with any disposition permitted hereunder); (E) amend, waive or otherwise modify this Section 11.16(b) or the
definitions of the terms used in this Section 11.16(b) insofar as the definitions affect the substance of this Section 11.16(b);
(F) consent to the assignment, delegation or other transfer by any Credit Party of any of its rights and obligations under
any Financing Document or release any Borrower of its payment obligations under any Financing Document, except, in each case with
respect to this clause (F), pursuant to a merger or consolidation permitted pursuant to this Agreement; or (G) amend any of
the provisions of Section 10.7 or amend any of the definitions Pro Rata Share, Revolving Loan Commitment, Revolving Loan Commitment
Amount, Revolving Loan Commitment Percentage or that provide for Lenders to receive their Pro Rata Shares of any fees, payments,
setoffs or proceeds of Collateral hereunder. It is hereby understood and agreed that all Lenders shall be deemed directly affected
by an amendment, waiver or other modification of the type described in the preceding clauses (C), (D), (E), (F) and (G) of the
preceding sentence.

95
 


Section 11.17
Assignments and Participations.
(a)
Assignments.
(i)
Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or any portion of such Lender's Loan together with
all related obligations of such Lender hereunder. Except as Agent may otherwise agree, the amount of any such assignment (determined
as of the date of the applicable Assignment Agreement or, if a "Trade Date" is specified in such Assignment Agreement,
as of such Trade Date) shall be in a minimum aggregate amount equal to $1,000,000 or, if less, the assignor's entire interests
in the outstanding Loan; provided, however, that, in connection with simultaneous assignments to two or more related
Approved Funds, such Approved Funds shall be treated as one assignee for purposes of determining compliance with the minimum assignment
size referred to above. Borrowers and Agent shall be entitled to continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
with the interests so assigned to an Eligible Assignee until Agent shall have received and accepted an effective Assignment Agreement
executed, delivered and fully completed by the applicable parties thereto and a processing fee of $3,500 to be paid by the assigning
Lender; provided, however, that only one processing fee shall be payable in connection with simultaneous assignments
to two or more related Approved Funds.
(ii)
From and after the date on which the conditions described above have been met, (A) such Eligible Assignee shall be
deemed automatically to have become a party hereto and, to the extent of the interests assigned to such Eligible Assignee pursuant
to such Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder, and (B) the assigning Lender, to
the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall be released
from its rights and obligations hereunder (other than those that survive termination pursuant to Section 12.1). Upon the request
of the Eligible Assignee (and, as applicable, the assigning Lender) pursuant to an effective Assignment Agreement, each Borrower
shall execute and deliver to Agent for delivery to the Eligible Assignee (and, as applicable, the assigning Lender) Notes in the
aggregate principal amount of the Eligible Assignee's Loan (and, as applicable, Notes in the principal amount of that portion of
the principal amount of the Loan retained by the assigning Lender). Upon receipt by the assigning Lender of such Note, the assigning
Lender shall return to Borrower Representative any prior Note held by it.
(iii)
Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of each Borrower, shall maintain at the office of its servicer located
in Bethesda, Maryland a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses
of each Lender, and the commitments of, and principal amount and stated interest of the Loan owing to, such Lender pursuant to
the terms hereof. The entries in such register shall be conclusive, and Borrower, Agent and Lenders may treat each Person whose
name is recorded therein pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding
notice to the contrary. No assignment shall be effective unless recorded in such register. Such register shall be available for
inspection by Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time upon reasonable prior notice to Agent. The parties intend that the
register be maintained such that the Loans are in "registered form" for the purposes of the Code.

96
 


(iv)
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.17(a) or any other provision of this Agreement, any Lender may
at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations
of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however,
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee
or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(v)
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.17(a) or any other provision of this Agreement, Agent has the
right, but not the obligation, to effectuate assignments of Loan via an electronic settlement system acceptable to Agent as designated
in writing from time to time to Lenders by Agent (the "Settlement Service"). At any time when Agent elects, in
its sole discretion, to implement such Settlement Service, each such assignment shall be effected by the assigning Lender and proposed
assignee pursuant to the procedures then in effect under the Settlement Service, which procedures shall be consistent with the
other provisions of this Section 11.17(a). Each assigning Lender and proposed Eligible Assignee shall comply with the requirements
of the Settlement Service in connection with effecting any assignment of Loan pursuant to the Settlement Service. With the prior
written approval of Agent, Agent's approval of such Eligible Assignee shall be deemed to have been automatically granted with respect
to any transfer effected through the Settlement Service. Assignments and assumptions of the Loan shall be effected by the provisions
otherwise set forth herein until Agent notifies Lenders of the Settlement Service as set forth herein.
(b)
Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower or Agent, sell to
one or more Persons (other than any Borrower or any Borrower's Affiliates) participating interests in its Loan, commitments or
other interests hereunder (any such Person, a "Participant"). In the event of a sale by a Lender of a participating
interest to a Participant, (i) such Lender's obligations hereunder shall remain unchanged for all purposes, (ii) Borrowers
and Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations hereunder,
and (iii) all amounts payable by each Borrower shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation and shall
be paid directly to such Lender; provided each participant shall be entitled to payments under Section 2.8 as if such participant
were a Lender if such participant complies with Section 2.8(c) as if it were a Lender accepting an interest in a Loan through an
assignment. Each Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due and payable (as a result of acceleration
or otherwise), each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its participating interest in amounts
owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender
under this Agreement; provided, however, that such right of set-off shall be subject to the obligation of each Participant
to share with Lenders, and Lenders agree to share with each Participant, as provided in Section 11.5. Each Lender that sells a
participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of Borrowers maintain a register on which it enters the name and
address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant's interest in the Obligations (each,
a "Participant Register"). The entries in the Participant Registers shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
Each Participant Register shall be available for inspection by Borrowers and Agent at any reasonable time upon reasonable prior
notice to the applicable Lender; provided, that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the
Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any
commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Financing Document) to any Person (including Borrowers)
except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation
is in registered form under the Code including Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. For the avoidance
of doubt, Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a participant register.

97
 


(c)
Replacement of Lenders. Within thirty (30) days after: (i) receipt by Agent of notice and demand from any Lender
for payment of additional costs as provided in Section 2.8(d), which demand shall not have been revoked, (ii) any Borrower
is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 2.8(a) or 2.8(b), (iii) any Lender is a Defaulted Lender, and the circumstances causing such status shall not have
been cured or waived; or (iv) any failure by any Lender to consent to a requested amendment, waiver or modification to any
Financing Document in which Required Lenders have already consented to such amendment, waiver or modification but the consent of
each Lender, or each Lender affected thereby, is required with respect thereto (each relevant Lender in the foregoing clauses (i)
through (iv) being an "Affected Lender") each of Borrower Representative and Agent may, at its option, notify
such Affected Lender and, in the case of Borrowers' election, Agent, of such Person's intention to obtain, at Borrowers' expense,
a replacement Lender ("Replacement Lender") for such Lender, which Replacement Lender shall be an Eligible Assignee
and, in the event the Replacement Lender is to replace an Affected Lender described in the preceding clause (iv), such Replacement
Lender consents to the requested amendment, waiver or modification making the replaced Lender an Affected Lender. In the event
Borrowers or Agent, as applicable, obtains a Replacement Lender within ninety (90) days following notice of its intention to do
so, the Affected Lender shall sell, at par, and assign all of its Loan and funding commitments hereunder to such Replacement Lender
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 11.17(a); provided, however, that (A) Borrowers shall
have reimbursed such Lender for its increased costs and additional payments for which it is entitled to reimbursement under Section
2.8(a) through (h), as applicable, of this Agreement through the date of such sale and assignment, and (B) Borrowers shall
pay to Agent the $3,500 processing fee in respect of such assignment. In the event that a replaced Lender does not execute an Assignment
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.17(a) within five (5) Business Days after receipt by such replaced Lender of notice of replacement
pursuant to this Section 11.17(c) and presentation to such replaced Lender of an Assignment Agreement evidencing an assignment
pursuant to this Section 11.17(c), such replaced Lender shall be deemed to have consented to the terms of such Assignment Agreement,
and any such Assignment Agreement executed by Agent, the Replacement Lender and, to the extent required pursuant to Section 11.17(a),
Borrowers, shall be effective for purposes of this Section 11.17(c) and Section 11.17(a). Upon any such assignment and payment,
such replaced Lender shall no longer constitute a "Lender" for purposes hereof, other than with respect to such rights
and obligations that survive termination as set forth in Section 12.1.

98
 


(d)
Credit Party Assignments. No Credit Party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or other obligations
hereunder or under any other Financing Document without the prior written consent of Agent and each Lender.
Section 11.18
Funding and Settlement Provisions Applicable When Non-Funding Lenders Exist. So long as Agent has not waived
the conditions to the funding of Revolving Loans set forth in Section 7.2, any Lender may deliver a notice to Agent stating that
such Lender shall cease making Revolving Loans due to the non-satisfaction of one or more conditions to funding Loans set forth
in Section 7.2, and specifying any such non-satisfied conditions. Any Lender delivering any such notice shall become a non-funding
Lender (a "Non-Funding Lender") for purposes of this Agreement commencing on the Business Day following receipt
by Agent of such notice, and shall cease to be a Non-Funding Lender on the date on which such Lender has either revoked the effectiveness
of such notice or acknowledged in writing to each of Agent the satisfaction of the condition(s) specified in such notice, or Required
Lenders waive the conditions to the funding of such Loans giving rise to such notice by Non-Funding Lender. Each Non-Funding Lender
shall remain a Lender for purposes of this Agreement to the extent that such Non-Funding Lender has Revolving Loan Outstandings
in excess of $0; provided, however, that during any period of time that any Non-Funding Lender exists, and notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary set forth herein, the following provisions shall apply:
(a)
For purposes of determining the Pro Rata Share of each Revolving Lender under clause (c) of the definition of such term,
each Non-Funding Lender shall be deemed to have a Revolving Loan Commitment Amount as in effect immediately before such Lender
became a Non-Funding Lender.
(b)
Except as provided in clause (a) above, the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount of each Non-Funding Lender shall be deemed
to be $0.
(c)
The Revolving Loan Commitment at any date of determination during such period shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of
(i) the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment Amounts of all Lenders, other than the Non-Funding Lenders as of such date plus
(ii) the aggregate Revolving Loan Outstandings of all Non-Funding Lenders as of such date.
(d)
[Reserved.]
(e)
Agent shall have no right to make or disburse Revolving Loans for the account of any Non-Funding Lender pursuant to Section
2.1(b)(i) to pay interest, fees, expenses and other charges of any Credit Party, other than reimbursement obligations that have
arisen pursuant to Section 2.5(c) in respect of Letters of Credit issued at the time such Non-Funding Lender was not then a Non-Funding
Lender.

99
 


(f)
Agent shall have no right to (i) make or disburse Revolving Loans as provided in Section 2.1(b)(i) for the account
of any Revolving Lender that was a Non-Funding Lender at the time of issuance of any Letter of Credit for which funding or reimbursement
obligations have arisen pursuant to Section 2.5(c), or (ii) assume that any Revolving Lender that was a Non-Funding Lender
at the time of issuance of such Letter of Credit will fund any portion of the Revolving Loans to be funded pursuant to Section
2.5(c) in respect of such Letter of Credit. In addition, no Revolving Lender that was a Non-Funding Lender at the time of issuance
of any Letter of Credit for which funding or reimbursement obligations have arisen pursuant to Section 2.5(c), shall have an obligation
to fund any portion of the Revolving Loans to be funded pursuant to Section 2.5(c) in respect to such Letter of Credit, or to make
any payment to Agent or the LC Issuer, as applicable, under Section 2.5(f)(ii) in respect of such Letter of Credit, or be deemed
to have purchased any interest or participation in such Letter of Credit from Agent or the LC Issuer, as applicable, under Section
2.5(f)(i).
(g)
To the extent that Agent applies proceeds of Collateral or other payments received by Agent to repayment of Revolving Loans
pursuant to Section 10.7, such payments and proceeds shall be applied first in respect of Revolving Loans made at the time any
Non-Funding Lenders exist, and second in respect of all other outstanding Revolving Loans.
Section 11.19
Buy-Out Upon Refinancing. MCF shall have the right to purchase from the other Lenders all of their respective
interests in the Loan at par in connection with any refinancing of the Loan upon one or more new economic terms, but which refinancing
is structured as an amendment and restatement of the Loan rather than a payoff of the Loan.
Section 11.20
Subordination Agreements. Each Lender by its execution of this Agreement or any Assignment Agreement, hereby
authorizes and instructs Agent to enter into, any take the actions provided in, each Subordination Agreement.
ARTICLE 12 - MISCELLANEOUS
Section 12.1
Survival. All agreements, representations and warranties made herein and in every other Financing Document shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Financing Documents. The provisions of Section 2.8 and Articles
11 and 12 shall survive the payment of the Obligations (both with respect to any Lender and all Lenders collectively) and any termination
of this Agreement and any judgment with respect to any Obligations, including any final foreclosure judgment with respect to any
Security Document, and no unpaid or unperformed, current or future, Obligations will merge into any such judgment.
Section 12.2
No Waivers. No failure or delay by Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege under any
Financing Document shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein and therein provided shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. Any reference in any Financing Document to the "continuing"
nature of any Event of Default shall not be construed as establishing or otherwise indicating that any Borrower or any other Credit
Party has the independent right to cure any such Event of Default, but is rather presented merely for convenience should such Event
of Default be waived in accordance with the terms of the applicable Financing Documents.

100
 


Section 12.3
Notices.
(a)
All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including prepaid overnight courier,
facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party at its address, facsimile number or e-mail address
set forth on the signature pages hereof (or, in the case of any such Lender who becomes a Lender after the date hereof, in an assignment
agreement or in a notice delivered to Borrower Representative and Agent by the assignee Lender forthwith upon such assignment)
or at such other address, facsimile number or e-mail address as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to Agent
and Borrower Representative; provided, however, that notices, requests or other communications shall be permitted
by electronic means only in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.3(b) and (c). Each such notice, request or other communication
shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile, when such notice is transmitted to the facsimile number specified by this Section
and the sender receives a confirmation of transmission from the sending facsimile machine, or (ii) if given by mail, prepaid
overnight courier or any other means, when received or when receipt is refused at the applicable address specified by this Section 12.3(a).
(b)
Notices and other communications to the parties hereto may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including
e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved from time to time by Agent, provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not apply to notices sent directly to any Lender if such Lender has notified Agent that it is incapable
of receiving notices by electronic communication. Agent or Borrower Representative may, in their discretion, agree to accept notices
and other communications to them hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it, provided,
however, that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.
(c)
Unless Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received
upon the sender's receipt of an acknowledgment from the intended recipient (such as by the "return receipt requested"
function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgment), and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet
or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described
in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address
therefor, provided, however, that if any such notice or other communication is not sent or posted during normal business
hours, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next Business Day.
Section 12.4
Severability. In case any provision of or obligation under this Agreement or any other Financing Document shall
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

101
 


Section 12.5
Headings. Headings and captions used in the Financing Documents (including the Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes
hereto and thereto) are included for convenience of reference only and shall not be given any substantive effect.
Section 12.6
Confidentiality.
(a)
Each Credit Party agrees not to transmit or disclose provisions of any Financing Document to any Person (other than to Borrowers'
advisors and officers on a need-to-know basis or as otherwise may be required by Law (including as required by the SEC)) without
Agent's prior written consent.
(b)
Agent and each Lender shall hold all non-public information regarding the Credit Parties and their respective businesses
identified as such by Borrowers and obtained by Agent or any Lender pursuant to the requirements hereof in accordance with such
Person's customary procedures for handling information of such nature, except that disclosure of such information may be made (i) to
their respective agents, employees, Subsidiaries, Affiliates, attorneys, auditors, professional consultants, rating agencies, insurance
industry associations and portfolio management services, (ii) to prospective transferees or purchasers of any interest in
the Loans, Agent or a Lender, and to prospective contractual counterparties (or the professional advisors thereto) in Swap Contracts
permitted hereby, provided, however, that any such Persons are bound by obligations of confidentiality, (iii) as
required by Law, subpoena, judicial order or similar order and in connection with any litigation, (iv) as may be required
in connection with the examination, audit or similar investigation of such Person, and (v) to a Person that is a trustee, investment
advisor or investment manager, collateral manager, servicer, noteholder or secured party in a Securitization (as hereinafter defined)
in connection with the administration, servicing and reporting on the assets serving as collateral for such Securitization. For
the purposes of this Section, "Securitization" shall mean (A) the pledge of the Loans as collateral security
for loans to a Lender, or (B) a public or private offering by a Lender or any of its Affiliates or their respective successors
and assigns, of securities which represent an interest in, or which are collateralized, in whole or in part, by the Loans. Confidential
