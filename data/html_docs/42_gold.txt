applied in a manner consistent with that used in preparing the Audited Financial Statements, except as otherwise specifically prescribed herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining compliance with any covenant (including the
computation of any financial covenant) contained herein, Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be carried at 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, and the effects of FASB ASC 825 on financial liabilities
shall be disregarded.  (b) Changes in GAAP. If at any time any change in GAAP would affect the computation of any financial ratio
or requirement set forth in any Loan Document, and either the Borrower or the Required Lenders shall so request, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower shall negotiate in good faith to amend such ratio or requirement to preserve the
original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP (subject to the approval of the Required Lenders); provided that, until so amended, (i) such ratio or requirement shall continue to be computed in accordance with GAAP prior to such
change therein and (ii) the Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders financial statements and other documents required under this Agreement or as reasonably requested hereunder setting forth a reconciliation between
calculations of such ratio or requirement made before and after giving effect to such change in GAAP. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement, leases shall continue to be classified and accounted for on a basis consistent with
that reflected in the Audited Financial Statements for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding any change in GAAP relating thereto, unless (i) the Borrower requests an amendment to this Agreement to amend such ratio or requirement to
preserve the original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP, and (ii) the Borrowers and the Required Lenders enter into a mutually acceptable amendment; provided that, until so amended, the Borrower shall provide to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders financial statements and other documents required under this Agreement or as reasonably requested hereunder setting forth a reconciliation between calculations of such ratio or requirement made before and after
giving effect to such change in GAAP.  (c) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. All references herein to consolidated
financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or to the determination of any amount for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or any similar reference shall, in each case, be deemed to include each variable interest
entity that the Borrower is required to consolidate pursuant to FASB ASC 810 as if such variable interest entity were a Subsidiary as defined herein. 
1.04 Rounding. Any financial ratios required to be maintained by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement shall be calculated by
dividing the appropriate component by the  
  23 



other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a
rounding-up if there is no nearest number).  1.05 Times of Day. Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to times of day
shall be references to Eastern time (daylight or standard, as applicable).  The Administrative Agent does not warrant, nor accept
responsibility, nor shall the Administrative Agent have any liability with respect to the administration, submission or any other matter related to the rates in the definition of Eurodollar Rate or with respect to any comparable or
successor rate thereto.  ARTICLE II 
THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS 
2.01 Borrowing of Term Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees (and not jointly or
jointly and severally) to make loans (each such loan, a Term Loan and collectively, the Term Loans) to the Borrower in Dollars during the Availability Period in an amount not to exceed such Lenders then
current Commitment; provided, that, subject to Section 2.14, the Borrower may only request two Borrowings during the Availability Period up to the aggregate amount of the Aggregate Commitments. Amounts borrowed and repaid or
prepaid hereunder may not be reborrowed. Term Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein; provided, however, that with respect to the Term Loan Borrowing made on the Closing Date, the Term Loan
Notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent prior to (a) 1:00 p.m. two Business Days prior to the Closing Date along with the Funding Indemnity Letter in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans or (b) 1:00 p.m. on the Closing Date, in
the case of Base Rate Loans. Each Lender shall make the amount of its Term Loans available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agents Payment Office not later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day
specified in the Term Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.01, the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the
Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to
(and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower.  2.02 Conversions and Continuations of Term Loans. 
(a) Each Term Loan Borrowing, each conversion of Term Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
be made upon the Borrowers irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by (A) telephone, or (B) a Term Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the
Administrative Agent of a Term Loan Notice. Each such Term Loan Notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (i) two Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Term Loans, and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Term Loans. Each conversion to or 
  24 



continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each conversion to Base Rate Term Loans shall be in a
principal amount of $250,000 or a whole multiple of $50,000 in excess thereof. Each Term Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a conversion of Term Loans from one Type to the other, or
a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Term Loans to be converted or continued, (iv) the Type
of Term Loans to which existing Term Loans are to be converted, and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Term Loan in a Term Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails
to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Term Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the
Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Term Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be
deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.  (b) Following receipt of a Term Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender thereof, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in
the preceding subsection.  (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last
day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan, unless the Borrower shall have compensated the Lenders as set forth in Section 3.05(a). During the existence of a Default or Event of Default, no Loans may be converted to or
continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders.  (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower
and the Lenders of any change in Bank of Americas prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change. 
(e) After giving effect to all Term Loan Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term
Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in effect with respect to Term Loans.  2.03 Intentionally
Omitted.  2.04 Intentionally Omitted. 
2.05 Prepayments. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Term
Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (A) two Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar 

  25 



Rate Loans and (B) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Term Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Term Loans shall be in a principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then
outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Term Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative Agent will
promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount
specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to
Section 3.05. Subject to Section 2.17, each such prepayment shall be applied to the Term Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages. 
2.06 Intentionally Omitted. 
2.07 Repayment of Loans. 
The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans outstanding on such date. The
Borrower shall repay to the Lenders the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans in quarterly principal installments equal to 1.25% of the original principal amount of the Aggregate Commitments (including any increase to the Aggregate
Commitments pursuant to Section 2.14) on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December (commencing on the last Business Day of the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2017; provided, that each payment due on
June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 30, 2017 shall be equal to one and two-thirds percent (1 2⁄3%) of the original
principal amount of the Aggregate Commitments including any increase to the Aggregate Commitments pursuant to Section 2.14); provided, however, that the final principal repayment installment of the Term Loans shall be
repaid on the Maturity Date and in any event shall be in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans outstanding on such date. 
2.08 Interest.  (a)
Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i)

ate at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
 (b)(i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. 
  26 


(ii) If an Event of Default under Section 8.01(f) shall have
occurred, the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. 
(iii) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due
(without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all
times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.  (iv) Upon the request of the Required
Lenders, while any Event of Default exists (other than as set forth in clauses (b)(i), (ii) and (iii) above) that has not been cured or waived within 30 days of notice from the Administrative Agent of the existence of such Event of Default
(such 30-day period to be calculated without duplication of any grace period otherwise applicable to such Default or Event of Default), the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating
interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.  (v)
Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.  (c)
Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and
after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.  2.09 Fees. 
(a) The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times
specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.  (b) The
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a delayed draw ticking fee (the Ticking Fee) equal to the Applicable Rate for Ticking Fees (on a per annum
basis) times the actual daily amount by which the Aggregate Commitments exceed the sum of the Outstanding Amount, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.17. The Ticking Fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability
Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such
date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period. The Ticking Fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be
computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. 
  27 


(c) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees with respect to this Agreement as shall have
been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 
2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Rate. 
(a) All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate) shall be made
on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as
applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion
is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  (b) If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to
the financial statements of the Borrower or for any other reason, the Borrower or the Lenders determine that (i) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper
calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders,
promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the
rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender under Section 2.08(b). The Borrowers obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.
 2.11 Evidence of Debt. The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained
by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made
by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to
the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall
control in the absence of manifest  
  28 



error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence
such Lenders Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
2.12 Payments Generally; Administrative Agents Clawback. 
(a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any
counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at
the Administrative Agents Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other
applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lenders Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding
Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of
time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.  (b)(i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative
Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Term Loan Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Term Loan Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on
the date of such Term Loan Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Term Loan Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on
such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Term Loan Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Term Loan Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender
and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with
banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower,
the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of
such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Term Loan Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Term Loan included in such Term Loan
Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
  29 


(ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative
Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then
each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent
manifest error.  (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for
any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set
forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 
(d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans and to make payments pursuant to
Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Term Loan, or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding
obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Term Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c). 
(e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or
manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
2.13 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain
payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Term Loans made by it, resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Term Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon
greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for 

  30 



cash at face value) participations in the Term Loans, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Term Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that: 
(i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to
and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Term Loans, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof
(as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor
of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.  2.14 Increase in Commitments. 
(a) Request for Increase. Upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Borrower may from time
to time, including after the end of the Availability Period, request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments by an aggregate amount not exceeding $100,000,000; provided that any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum
amount of $20,000,000 or any whole multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof; provided, further, the Borrower may make a maximum of five (5) such requests. To achieve such requested increase, the Borrower may invite the Lenders to make
additional Commitments and/or may invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel, provided any Commitments made by an Eligible
Assignee pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. At the time of sending the notice described in the first sentence of this Section, the Borrower
(in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender and/or Eligible Assignee (each such Lender that agrees to make additional Commitments, an Increasing Lender) is requested to
respond (which shall in no event be less than five (5) Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to such Lender or Eligible Assignee). 
(b) Elections to Increase. Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to
increase its Commitments and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its
Commitments. Any Lender approached to increase its Commitments may elect to decline, in its sole discretion, to increase its Commitments. 
  31 


(c) Notification by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders responses to each request made hereunder.  (d) Funding Date and Allocations. If the
Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section 2.14, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective date (the Term Facility Increase Funding Date) and the final allocation of such
increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Term Facility Increase Funding Date. 
(e) Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase. As a condition precedent to such increase, the Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Term Facility Increase Funding Date signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or
consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the case of the Borrower, certifying that, immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such increase, (A) no Default exists or would arise from such increase, and (B) the
representations and warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Term Facility Increase Funding Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an
earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.14, the representations and warranties contained in subsection (a) of Section 5.05 shall be
deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to clause (a) of Section 6.01. The additional Commitments shall be made by the Lenders participating therein pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 2.01.  (f) Conflicting Provisions. This Section 2.14 shall supersede any provisions in
Section 2.13 or Section 10.01 to the contrary.  2.15 Intentionally Omitted. 
2.16 Intentionally Omitted. 
2.17 Defaulting Lenders. 
(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then,
until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:  (i)
Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and
Section 10.01.  (ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other
amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender
pursuant 
  32 



to Section 10.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such
Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund
its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender
against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fourth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a
result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and fifth, to such Defaulting
Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate
share, and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to
being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder without giving effect to Section 2.17(a)(iv). Any payments,
prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 (b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting
Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion
of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Term Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages,
whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and
provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from
that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.  ARTICLE III 
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 
3.01 Taxes.  (a)
Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required
pursuant to 
  33 



applicable law, provided that if the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such
payments, then (i) the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions with respect to Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including deductions with respect to Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 
(b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay
any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of any Other Taxes. 
(c) Tax Indemnification. 
(i) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full
amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender and any penalties, interest and
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment
or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and
shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(ii) below. Upon making such
payment to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall be subrogated to the rights of the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(ii) below against the applicable defaulting Lender (other than the right of set off pursuant to the
last sentence of Section 3.01(c)(ii)).  (ii) Each Lender shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make
payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, (x) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative
Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (y) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the
provisions of Section 10.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, that are payable or paid
by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower in connection with any Loan Document, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or 
  34 



with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii).  (d) Evidence of
Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy
of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(e) Status of Lenders. Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly
completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent,
shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to
backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S.
Person, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable
request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax, and (B) any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable: 
(i) duly completed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E (or W-BBEN if applicable) claiming eligibility for
benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,  (ii) duly completed originals of Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8ECI, 
  35 


(iii) duly completed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY and all
required supporting documentation,  (iv) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for
portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent
shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed originals of
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E (or W-BBEN if applicable),  (v) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a
basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to
determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; or  (vi) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document
would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable),
such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply
with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (iv),
FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby
authorize the Administrative Agent to treat) this Agreement as not qualifying as a grandfathered obligation within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i). 
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in
any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith,
that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to
such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other 
  36 



Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by
the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
(g) Survival. Each partys obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the
Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 
3.02 Illegality. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is
unlawful, for any Lender or its Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority
has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent,
(i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Term Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining
Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the
Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.
Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on
which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period
therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of
such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component
thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall
also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 
  37 


3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason
in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period
of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed
Base Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will
promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with
respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders)
revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request
for a Term Loan Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.  3.04 Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate
Loans.  (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e)); 
(ii) subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any participation in any Eurodollar
Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded
Tax payable by such Lender); or  (iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or
expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or participation therein;  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be
to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the
amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
  38 


(b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such
Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of
such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but
for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.  (c)
Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and
delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
(d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased
costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation
therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
(e) Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain
reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as Eurocurrency liabilities), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal
to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan,
provided the Borrower shall have received at least 10 days prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest
Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.  3.05 Compensation for Losses.
Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); 
  39 


(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a
Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or 
(c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;  excluding any loss of anticipated profits but including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation
or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with
the foregoing.  For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be
deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not
such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.  3.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. 
(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrower is required
to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to
designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment
(i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not
subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or
assignment.  (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13. 
3.07 Survival. All of the Borrowers obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate
Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.  ARTICLE IV

ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 
9.01 Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the
Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof,
together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any
of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other
implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
 9.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its
capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise
requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory
capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 9.03 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set
forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: 
(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; 
(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for
herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary
to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a
Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and 
  62 


(c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any
duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates
in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02)
or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default
unless and until notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender.  The Administrative Agent
shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report
or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of
any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV
or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.  9.04
Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including
any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement
made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, that by its terms
must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the
making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in
accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  9.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent
may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may
perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent
and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of  
  63 



the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents
except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. 
9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent 
(a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice
of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If
no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the
Required Lenders) (the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth
above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. 
(b) If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the
Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, in consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor. If no such successor shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Removal Effective Date), then such removal shall
nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.  (c) With effect from the Resignation Effective
Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) except for any indemnity payments
or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender, until such time,
if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of
the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or removed) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 3.01(g) and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed
Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the
Borrower and such successor. After the retiring or removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions 
  64 



of this Article and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. 
9.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to
make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
9.08 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Arranger, Syndication Agent and Documentation Agent
listed on the cover page hereof shall not have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder. 
9.09 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other
judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise 
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other
Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 10.04) allowed in such judicial
proceeding; and  (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the
same;  and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby
authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 10.04. 
  65 


Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or
accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in
any such proceeding.  9.10 Collateral and Guaranty Matters. The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its
option and in its discretion,  (a) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any
Loan Document (i) upon termination of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations), (ii) that is sold or to be sold as part of or in connection with any sale permitted
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or (iii) subject to Section 10.01, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders; and 
(b) to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction
permitted hereunder.  Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agents
authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section 9.10. 
ARTICLE X  MISCELLANEOUS
 10.01 Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to
any departure by the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective (except as provided in Section 2.14) unless in writing signed by the Required Lenders and the Borrower or the applicable Loan Party, as the case may be,
and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such amendment, waiver or consent
shall:  (a) waive any condition set forth in Section 4.01(a) without the written consent of each Lender; 
(b) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate any Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 8.02) without the
written consent of such Lender;  (c) postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any payment of principal,
interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; 
(d) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on any Loan, or (subject to clause (iv) of the second proviso to
this Section 10.01) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each 
  66 



Lender directly affected thereby; provided, however, that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary (i) to amend the definition of Default Rate or
to waive any obligation of the Borrower to pay interest at the Default Rate or (ii) to amend any financial covenant hereunder (or any defined term used therein) even if the effect of such amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any
Loan or to reduce any fee payable hereunder;  (e) except as provided in Section 2.14, alter Section 2.13 or
Section 8.03 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender; 
(f) change any provision of this Section or the definition of Required Lenders or any other provision hereof specifying the number
or percentage of Lenders required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder without the written consent of each Lender; or 
(g) release all or substantially all of the value of the Guaranty without the written consent of each Lender, except to the extent the release
of any Guarantor is permitted pursuant to Section 9.10 (in which case such release may be made by the Administrative Agent acting alone); 
and, provided further, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders
required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any
amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders),
except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by
its terms affects any Defaulting Lender disproportionately adversely relative to other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender. 
If any Lender does not consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, consent or release with respect to any Loan Document that requires the consent of each Lender
and that has been approved by the Required Lenders (such Lender, a Non-Consenting Lender), the Borrower may replace such non-consenting Lender in accordance with Section 10.13; provided that such amendment,
waiver, consent or release can be effected as a result of the assignment contemplated by such Section (together with all other such assignments required by the Borrower to be made pursuant to this paragraph).

damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agents transmission of Borrower Materials or notices through the Platform, any other electronic
platform or electronic messaging service, or through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have
resulted from the gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for indirect, special,
incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages).  (d) Change of Address, Etc. Each of the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent may change its address, facsimile or telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. Each other Lender may change its address, facsimile or telephone number
for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. In addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record
(i) an effective address, contact name, telephone number, facsimile number and electronic mail address to which notices and other communications may be sent and (ii) accurate wire instructions for such Lender. Furthermore, each Public
Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the Private Side Information or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable
such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lenders compliance procedures and applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws, to make reference to Borrower Materials that are not made available
through the Public Side Information portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws. 
(e) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any
notices (including telephonic Term Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice
specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses,
costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic notices to and other telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded
by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording. 
  69 


10.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by any Lender or the Administrative Agent
to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided and provided under each other Loan Document are cumulative
and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in
any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such
enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 8.02 for the benefit of all the Lenders; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit
(a) the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (b) any Lender from exercising
setoff rights in accordance with Section 10.08 (subject to the terms of Section 2.13), or (c) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding
relative to any Loan Party under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders shall
have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b) and (c) of the preceding proviso and subject to
Section 2.13, any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders. 
10.04 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. 
(a) Costs and Expenses. The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and
its Affiliates (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent), in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and
administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), and (ii) all
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender) in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights
(A) in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or (B) in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout,
restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans. 
  70 


(b) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent
(and any sub-agent thereof), the Arranger and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee) incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Borrower or any other Loan
Party arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their
respective obligations hereunder or thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the administration of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (ii) any Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether
based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower or any other Loan Party, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; IN ALL CASES, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR
IN PART, OUT OF THE COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNITEE, provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, (y) result from a claim
brought by the Borrower or any other Loan Party against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitees obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower or such Loan Party has obtained a final and nonappealable
judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or (z) result from disputes solely between Indemnitees and not (i) involving any action or inaction by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors or other representatives, or (ii) relating to any action of such Indemnitee in its capacity as Administrative Agent or an Arranger. 
This Section 10.04(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related
expenses arising from any non-Tax claim.  (c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to
indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought based
on each Lenders share of the Total Outstandings at such time) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid amount in respect of a claim asserted by such Lender), such payment to be made severally among them based on such Lenders
Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought), provided, further  
  71 



that, the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such
sub-agent) in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection
(c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.12(d).  (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, and acknowledges that no other Person shall have, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or
punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such
unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for
direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten Business Days after demand therefor. 
(f) Survival. The agreements in this Section and the indemnity provisions of Section 10.02(e) shall survive the resignation
of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations. 
10.05 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then
(a) to the extent of such recovery and to the extent permitted by law, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such
setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon
from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment
in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
  72 


10.06 Successors and Assigns. 
(a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each
Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any
party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent
provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this
Agreement.  (b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(i) Minimum Amounts. 
(1) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment and the Loans at the
time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
(2) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this
purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and
Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $10,000,000 unless each of the
Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to
members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining
whether such minimum amount has been met. 
  73 


(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an
assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned; 
(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection
(b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:  (1) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the
Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof; and 
(2) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if
such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender. 
(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee charged to the applicable Lender or prospective Lender in the amount of $3,500 as well as any documentation or information required pursuant to Section 3.01(e);
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.  (v) No Assignment to Borrower. No such assignment shall be made (A) to
the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Subsidiaries, (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B),
or (C) to a natural Person (or a holding company investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person). 
(vi) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender
hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount
sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in

  74 



full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate)
its full pro rata share of all Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable
Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the
assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with respect to
facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release
of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of
this Section.  (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower (and such agency
being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell
participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural person, a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers
Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it);
provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement 
  75 



shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under
Section 10.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents;
provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of the first proviso
to Section 10.01 that directly affects such Participant (it being understood that (i) any vote to rescind any acceleration made pursuant to Section 8.02 of amounts owing with respect to the Loans and other Obligations
and (ii) any modifications of the provisions relating to amounts, timing or application of prepayments of Loans and other Obligations shall not require the approval of such Participant). Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, each
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent (subject to the requirements in those sections, including timely delivery of forms pursuant to
Section 3.01) as if it were a Lender of the relevant Loan and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions
of Sections 3.06 and 10.13 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any
participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except, subject to subsection (e) of this Section, to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a
Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrowers to effectuate
the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such
Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters
the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit
or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c)
of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such
participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant
Register. 
  76 


(e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive
any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is
made with the Borrowers prior written consent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant (in the case of a Participant that
would be a Foreign lender if it were a Lender) and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply, and does so comply, with Section 3.01(e) as though it were a Lender (it being agreed that any requirement in
Section 3.01(e) that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent request a form, certificate or other documentation shall be treated for this purpose as having been satisfied). 
(f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  10.07 Treatment of
Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its
and its Affiliates respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and representatives (it being understood that such disclosures will be made solely on a need to know basis and that the Persons to whom such disclosure is
made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including
any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto,
(e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder,
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement or any Eligible Assignee invited to be a Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, or (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by
reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (g) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided
hereunder or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market identifiers with respect to the credit facilities provided hereunder, (h) with the consent of
the Borrower or (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective
Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. The Administrative Agent agrees to the extent commercially reasonable, to provide the Borrower with prior notice of any disclosures required of the Administrative Agent
under Section 10.07(c).  
  77 



In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and non-confidential information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service
providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Agents and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Commitments. 
For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to
the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.  Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information
and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws. 
10.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of their respective
Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency other
than accounts held as trust account for the benefit of third parties) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against
any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or its respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or Affiliate shall have made any demand
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such
deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further
application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.17 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of
each Lender and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  
  78 


10.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any
Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender
shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted
for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather
than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations
hereunder.  10.10 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different
parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the
parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging means (e.g. pdf or tif) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 
10.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent
and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any
Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied. 
10.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable,
(a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating
to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited. 
  79 


10.13 Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or if any
other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to
assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan
Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that: 
(a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.06(b); 
(b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued
fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the
Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);  (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
(d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and 
(e) in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the
applicable amendment, waiver, consent or release.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result
of a promptly delivered waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
10.14 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc. 
(a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT

ANY LENDER MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AGAINST THE BORROWER OR ITS PROPERTIES IN THE COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION. 
(c) WAIVER OF VENUE. THE BORROWER IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IN ANY COURT REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SECTION. EACH OF THE

corporation, BAKERY CAFE CARDS, LLC, a Virginia limited liability company and any other Person (as defined in the Loan Agreement) which may become a Guarantor hereunder pursuant to a duly executed Joinder Agreement to Guaranty in the form
attached as Exhibit A hereto (collectively, the Guarantors, each as a Guarantor) in favor of BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., a national banking association, as administrative agent (hereinafter, in such
capacity, the Administrative Agent) for itself and the other lending institutions (hereinafter, collectively, the Lenders) which are, or may become, parties to that certain Term Loan Agreement dated as of
February 1, 2017 (as amended, restated, extended, supplemented or otherwise modified in writing from time to time, the Loan Agreement; the terms defined therein being used herein as therein defined), among Panera Bread
Company, a Delaware corporation, as the borrower (the Borrower), the Lenders from time to time party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent. 
WHEREAS, the Borrower and the Guarantors are members of a group of related corporations, the success of any one of which is dependent
in part on the success of the other members of such group;  WHEREAS, each Guarantor expects to receive substantial direct and
indirect benefits from the extensions of credit to the Borrower by the Lenders pursuant to the Loan Agreement (which benefits are hereby acknowledged); 
WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the Lenders making any Loans or otherwise extending credit to the Borrower under the Loan
Agreement that each Guarantor execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, this Guaranty; and 
WHEREAS, each Guarantor and the Administrative Agent wish to enter into this Guaranty for the benefit of the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent as provided herein.  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises contained herein and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged each Guarantor hereby agrees with the Lenders and the Administrative Agent as follows: 
1. Definitions. The term Obligations and all other capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the
respective meanings provided therefor in the Loan Agreement.  2. Guaranty of Payment and Performance. Each Guarantor
hereby jointly and severally unconditionally guarantees to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent the full and  



punctual payment when due (whether at stated maturity, by required pre-payment, by acceleration or otherwise), as well as the performance, of all of the Obligations including all such which would
become due but for the operation of the automatic stay pursuant to §362(a) of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code) and the operation of §§502(b) and 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. This Guaranty is
an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual payment and performance of all of the Obligations and not of their collectibility only and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any
Lender first attempt to collect any of the Obligations from the Borrower or resort to any collateral security or other means of obtaining payment. Should an Event of Default occur and be continuing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder with
respect to such Obligations shall, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, become immediately due and payable to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, without demand or notice of any nature, all of
which are expressly waived by each Guarantor. Payments by any Guarantor hereunder may be required by the Administrative Agent on any number of occasions. All payments by each Guarantor hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, in the
manner and at the place of payment specified therefor in the Loan Agreement, for the account of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent. 
3. Guarantors Agreement to Pay Enforcement Costs, etc. Each Guarantor further jointly and severally agrees, as the
principal obligor and not as a guarantor only, to pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, all costs and expenses (including court costs and legal expenses) incurred or expended by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the
Obligations, this Guaranty and the enforcement thereof, together with interest on amounts recoverable under this §3 from the time when such amounts become due until payment, whether before or after judgment, at the rate of interest for overdue
amounts set forth in the Loan Agreement, provided that if such interest exceeds the maximum amount permitted to be paid under applicable law, then such interest shall be reduced to such maximum permitted amount. 
4. Waivers by Guarantors; Lenders Freedom to Act. Each Guarantor agrees that the Obligations will be paid and performed
strictly in accordance with their respective terms, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect thereto.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall obligate a Guarantor to make any payment which is illegal for such Guarantor to have made under any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction applicable to such
Guarantor. Each Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, presentment, demand, protest, notice of acceptance, notice of any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay,
moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of the Borrower, the Guarantors or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the
Obligations, and all suretyship defenses generally. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor agrees to the provisions of any instrument evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Obligation and agrees
that the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right
or remedy against the Borrower or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable  
  -2- 



with respect to any of the Obligations; (ii) any extensions, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or renewals of any Obligation; (iii) any change in the time, place or manner of
payment of any of the Obligations or any rescissions, waivers, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or other amendments or modifications of any of the terms or provisions of the Loan Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other
agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Obligations; (iv) the addition, substitution or release of any entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable for any Obligation; (v) the adequacy
of any rights which the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against any collateral security or other means of obtaining repayment of any of the Obligations; (vi) the impairment of any collateral securing any of the Obligations,
including without limitation the failure to perfect or preserve any rights which the Administrative Agent or any Lender might have in such collateral security or the substitution, exchange, surrender, release, loss or destruction of any such
collateral security; or (vii) any other act or omission which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Guarantor or otherwise operate as a release or discharge of such Guarantor, all of which may be done without notice to any
of the Guarantors. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of (A) any one action or anti-deficiency law which would otherwise
prevent the Administrative Agent or any Lender from bringing any action, including any claim for a deficiency, or exercising any other right or remedy (including any right of set-off), against such Guarantor before or after the Administrative
Agents or such Lenders commencement or completion of any foreclosure action, whether judicially, by exercise of power of sale or otherwise, or (B) any other law which in any other way would otherwise require any election of remedies
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender.  5. Unenforceability of Obligations Against Borrower. If for any reason the
Borrower has no legal existence or is under no legal obligation to discharge any of the Obligations, or if any of the Obligations have become irrecoverable from the Borrower by reason of the Borrowers insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization
or by other operation of law or for any other reason, this Guaranty shall nevertheless be binding on each Guarantor to the same extent as if such Guarantor at all times had been the principal obligor on all such Obligations. This Guaranty shall be
in addition to any other guaranty or other security for the Obligations, and it shall not be prejudiced or rendered unenforceable by the inability of any such other guaranty or security. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any
of the Obligations is stayed upon the application of any Debtor Relief Laws to the Borrower, or for any other reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or
any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Obligation shall be immediately due and payable by each Guarantor. 
6. Subrogation; Subordination. 
6.1. Waiver of Rights Against Borrower. Until the final payment in cash and performance in full of all of the
Obligations, (i) no Guarantor shall exercise and each hereby waives any rights against the Borrower arising as a result of payment by such Guarantor hereunder, by way of subrogation, reimbursement, restitution, contribution or otherwise, and
will not prove any claim in competition with the Administrative Agent or 
  -3- 



any Lender in respect of any payment hereunder in any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization case or proceedings of any nature; (ii) no Guarantor will claim any setoff, recoupment or
counterclaim against the Borrower in respect of any liability of such Guarantor to the Borrower; and (iii) each Guarantor waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which may be held by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender.  6.2. Subordination. The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of
the Borrower for money borrowed or credit received now or hereafter owed to any of the Guarantors is hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all of the Obligations. Each Guarantor
agrees that, after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, such Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of the Borrower to any of the Guarantors until all of the Obligations
shall have been paid in full in cash. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any Guarantor shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any Obligations are still outstanding, such amounts shall be
collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor as trustee for the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and be paid over to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, on account of the Obligations
without affecting in any manner the liability of any Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty.  6.3.
Provisions Supplemental. The provisions of this §6 shall be supplemental to and not in derogation of any rights and remedies of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under any separate subordination agreement which the
Administrative Agent may at any time and from time to time enter into with any Guarantor for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent. 
7. Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each of their
respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever
currency other than accounts held as trust accounts for the benefit of third parties) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by the Administrative Agent, such Lender, or any such Affiliate to or for the
credit or the account of any Guarantor against any and all of the obligations of such Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Guaranty or any other Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, irrespective of whether or not the
Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made any demand under this Guaranty or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of such Guarantor may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of the Administrative
Agent or such Lender different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of the Administrative Agent, each Lender and their respective Affiliates under this §7 are in addition to other rights
and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that the Administrative Agent, such Lender or their respective Affiliates may have. The Administrative Agent and each Lender agree to notify the applicable Guarantor and the Administrative Agent
promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 
  -4- 


8. Further Assurances. Each Guarantor agrees that it will from time to time, at the
request of the Administrative Agent, do all such things and execute all such documents as the Administrative Agent may consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this Guaranty and to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of the
Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereunder. Each Guarantor acknowledges and confirms that such Guarantor itself has established its own adequate means of obtaining from the Borrower on a continuing basis all information desired by such Guarantor
concerning the financial condition of the Borrower and that such Guarantor will look to the Borrower and not to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in order for such Guarantor to keep adequately informed of changes in the Borrowers
financial condition.  9. Termination; Reinstatement. This Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect until the
Obligations have been paid in cash and performed in full and all credit commitments of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in respect thereof have terminated. This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, notwithstanding any
termination, if at any time any payment made or value received with respect to any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or
any of the Guarantors hereunder, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made or value received.  10.
Successors and Assigns. This Guaranty shall be binding upon each Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors, transferees and assigns.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, each Lender may assign or otherwise transfer the Loan Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement or note held by it evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in
connection with the Obligations, or sell participations in any interest therein, to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested, to the extent set forth in the agreement evidencing such assignment, transfer or
participation, with all the rights in respect thereof granted to such Lender herein, all in accordance with §10.06 of the Loan Agreement. No Guarantor may assign any of its obligations hereunder. 
11. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Guaranty nor consent to any departure by any
Guarantor therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the procedures set forth in §10.01 of the Loan Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to affect or impair any
right with respect to the Obligations that is not expressly dealt with therein. No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. 
12. Notices. All notices and other communications called for hereunder shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise
specifically provided herein, shall be deemed to have been duly made or given when made or given in accordance with §10.02 of the Loan Agreement,  
  -5- 



addressed as follows: if to a Guarantor, at the address of the Borrower indicated in Schedule 10.02 of the Credit Agreement, and if to the Administrative Agent, at the address for notices to the
Administrative Agent set forth in §10.02 of the Loan Agreement, or at such address as either party may designate in writing to the other. 
13. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK (EXCLUDING THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO CONFLICTS OR CHOICE OF LAW (OTHER THAN THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW §5-1401)). Each Guarantor agrees that any suit for the enforcement of
this Guaranty may be brought in the courts of the State of New York or any federal court sitting therein and consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of such court and to service of process in any such suit being made upon such Guarantor by mail at
the address specified by reference in §12. Each Guarantor hereby waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such suit or any such court or that such suit was brought in an inconvenient court. 
14. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH GUARANTOR, AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FOR ITSELF AND THE LENDERS BY ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
GUARANTY, HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTY, ANY RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OF SUCH RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS. Except
as prohibited by law, each Guarantor hereby waives any right which it may have to claim or recover in any litigation referred to in the preceding sentence any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages or any damages other than, or in
addition to, actual damages. Each Guarantor (i) certifies that neither the Administrative Agent or any Lender nor any representative, agent or attorney of the Administrative Agent or any Lender has represented, expressly or otherwise, that the
Administrative Agent or any Lender would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waivers and (ii) acknowledges that, in entering into the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Administrative Agent or
any Lender is a party, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are relying upon, among other things, the waivers and certifications contained in this §14. 
15. Miscellaneous. This Guaranty constitutes the entire agreement of each Guarantor with respect to the matters set forth
herein. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or any other agreement. The invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more sections of this Guaranty shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of its remaining provisions. This Guaranty may be executed in any number of counterparts, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same agreement. Captions are for the ease of reference only and shall not
affect the meaning of the relevant provisions. The meanings of all defined terms used in this Guaranty shall be equally applicable to the singular and plural forms of the terms defined. 
16. Concerning Joint and Several Liability of the Guarantors. 
(a) Each Guarantor accepts joint and several liability for the Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in consideration of
the financial accommodations to be 
  -6- 



provided by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under the Loan Agreement, for the mutual benefit, directly and indirectly, of each Guarantor and in consideration of the undertakings of each
other Guarantor to accept joint and several liability for the Obligations.  (b) Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with the other Guarantors with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations arising under this Guaranty without preferences
or distinction among them.  (c) The obligations of each Guarantor under the provisions of this Guaranty constitute full recourse
obligations of each Guarantor enforceable against each such Guarantor to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Documents or any other
circumstance whatsoever.  (d) To the extent any Guarantor makes a payment hereunder in excess of the aggregate amount of the benefit
received by such Guarantor in respect of the extensions of credit under the Loan Agreement (the Benefit Amount), then such Guarantor, after the payment in full, in cash, of all of the Obligations, shall be entitled to recover from
each other Guarantor such excess payment, pro rata, in accordance with the ratio of the Benefit Amount received by each such other Guarantor to the total Benefit Amount received by all Guarantors, and the right to such recovery shall be deemed to be
an asset and property of such Guarantor so funding; provided, that each Guarantor hereby agrees that it will not enforce any of its rights of contribution or subrogation against the other Guarantors with respect to any liability incurred by it
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, any payments made by it to any of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent with respect to any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor until such time as all of the Obligations have
been irrevocably paid in full in cash. Any claim which any Guarantor may have against any other Guarantor with respect to any payments to the Lenders or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document are hereby expressly made
subordinate and junior in right of payment, without limitation as to any increases in the Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full of the Obligations and, in the event of the application of any Debtor Relief Laws
relating to any Guarantor, its debts or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any
other Guarantor therefor.  (e) It is the intention and agreement of the Guarantors and the Lenders that the obligations of the Guarantors
under this Guaranty shall be valid and enforceable against each Guarantor to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If any provision of this Guaranty creating any obligation of the Guarantors in favor of the Lenders shall be declared to be
invalid or unenforceable in any respect or to any extent, it is the stated intention and agreement of the Guarantors and the Lenders that any balance of the obligation created by such provision and all other obligations of the Guarantors to the
Lenders created by other provisions of this Guaranty shall remain valid and enforceable. Likewise, if by final order a court of competent jurisdiction shall declare any sums which the Lenders may be otherwise entitled to collect from a Guarantor
under this Guaranty to be in excess of those permitted under any law (including any federal or state fraudulent conveyance or like statute or rule of law) applicable to such Guarantors 
  -7- 



obligations under this Guaranty, it is the stated intention and agreement of the Guarantors and the Lenders that all sums not in excess of those permitted under such applicable law shall remain
fully collectible by the Lenders from such Guarantor.  (f) Each Guarantor makes as to itself, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders, the representations applicable to it contained in Article V of the Loan Agreement.  [Remainder of page intentionally
