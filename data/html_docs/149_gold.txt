any other Loan Document, collectively, the “Collateral”).(b)Each Credit Party executing this Agreement and Administrative Agent agree that this Agreement creates, and is intended to create, valid and continuing Liens upon the Collateral in favor of Administrative Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties.  Each such Credit Party represents, warrants and promises to Agents and Lenders that: (i) such Credit Party is the sole owner of each item of the Collateral upon which it purports to grant a Lien pursuant to the Loan Documents, and has good and marketable title thereto free and clear of any and all Liens or claims of others, other than Permitted Liens; (ii) the security interests granted pursuant to this Agreement will constitute valid perfected security interests in all of the Collateral in favor of Administrative Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties as security for the prompt and complete payment and performance of the Obligations, enforceable in accordance with the terms hereof

enforceability may be limited by applicable Debtor Relief Laws and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).  When (i) any certificates representing such Equity Interests pledged to Administrative Agent (and constituting “certificated securities” within the meaning of the UCC) are delivered to Administrative Agent, (ii) Collateral with respect to which a security interest may be perfected only by possession or control, upon the taking of possession or control by Administrative Agent of such Collateral, and (iii) the other personal property Collateral described in the Loan Documents, when financing statements in appropriate form are filed in the appropriate filing offices, appropriate assignments or notices are filed in each applicable IP Office and such other filings as are specified in the Loan Documents have been completed, the Lien on the Collateral created by the Loan Documents shall (to the extent of the foregoing actions)​71​​constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest of the Credit  Parties in such Collateral, as security for the Obligations, in each case prior to the Liens of any other Person (except Permitted Liens permitted under the terms of the Loan Documents to have priority over the Liens securing the Obligations).(d)Each Credit Party

effect, regardless of whether any particular asset comprised in the Collateral falls within the scope of Article 9 of the UCC or such jurisdiction, or (y) as being of an equal or lesser scope or with greater detail, and (ii) contain any other information required by Part 5 of Article 9 of the UCC or the filing office for acceptance of any financing statement or amendment, including whether each Credit Party is an organization, the type of organization and any organization identification number issued to each Credit Party, and in the case of a financing statement filed as a fixture filing or

Agent and each Agent shall have the right to participate in such action.(b)Each Credit Party shall remain liable under each Contract, Instrument and License to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder, and neither Agents nor any Lender shall have any obligation or liability whatsoever to any Person under any Contract, Instrument or License (between any Credit Party and any Person other than an Agent or any Lender) by reason of or arising out of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, and neither Agents nor any Lender shall be required or obligated in any manner (i) to perform or fulfill any of the obligations of any Credit Party, (ii) to make any payment or inquiry, or (iii) to take any action of any kind

Attorney unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  Each Credit Party authorizes Administrative Agent to file any financing or continuation statement without the signature of any Credit Party to the extent permitted by applicable law.  NONE OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE TO ANY CREDIT

of Borrower, to (a) have access to, visit, inspect, review, evaluate and make physical verification and appraisals of each Credit Party’s properties and the Collateral, (b) inspect, examine and copy (or take originals if necessary) and make extracts from such Credit Party’s Books and Records, including management letters prepared by independent accountants, and (c) discuss with each Credit

of them arising out of the repossession, retention or sale of any Collateral except such as are determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen solely out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.  Each Credit Party agrees that ten (10) days prior notice by Administrative Agent to each Credit Party of the time and place of any public sale or of the time after which a private sale may take place is reasonable notification of such matters.  Each Credit Party shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all amounts to which Agents and Lenders are entitled.(d)Agents’ and Lenders’ rights and remedies under this Agreement shall be cumulative and nonexclusive of any other rights and remedies which Agents or any Lender may have under any other Loan Document or at law or in equity.  Recourse to the Collateral shall not be required.  All provisions of this Agreement are intended to be subject to all applicable mandatory provisions of law that may be controlling and to be limited, to the extent necessary, so that they do not render this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part.12.3Waivers.  Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Credit Party

Indemnities; Withholding.(a)Each Lender agrees to reimburse each Agent and each of its Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by any Credit Party) promptly upon demand, severally and ratably, for any costs and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of financial, legal​84​​and other advisors and taxes paid in the name of, or on behalf of, any Credit Party) that may be incurred by any Agent or any of its Related Persons in connection with the preparation, syndication, execution, delivery, administration, modification, consent, waiver or enforcement of, or the taking of any other action (whether through negotiations, through any work-out, bankruptcy, restructuring or other legal or other proceeding (including, without limitation, preparation for and/or response to any subpoena or request for document production relating thereto) or otherwise) in respect of, or legal advice with respect to its rights or responsibilities under, any Loan Document.(b)Each Lender further agrees to indemnify each Agent and each of its Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by any Credit Party), severally and ratably, from and against liabilities (including taxes, interests and penalties imposed for not properly withholding or backup withholding on payments made to or for the account of any Lender) that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any Agent or any of its Related Persons in any matter relating to or arising out of, in connection with or as a result of any Loan Document or any other act, event or transaction related, contemplated in or attendant to any such document, or, in each case, any action taken or omitted to be taken by any Agent or any of its Related Persons under or with respect to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable to any Agent or any of its Related Persons to the extent such liability has resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent or, as the case may be, such Related Person, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment or order.(c)To the extent required by any applicable law, Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender under a Loan Document an amount equal to any applicable withholding tax.  If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate certification form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or fails to establish an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax with respect to a particular type of payment, or because such Lender failed to notify Administrative Agent or any other Person of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason), or Administrative Agent reasonably determines that it was required to withhold taxes from a prior payment but failed to do so, such Lender shall promptly indemnify Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by such Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and together with all expenses incurred by Administrative Agent, including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses.  Administrative Agent may offset against any payment to any Lender under a Loan Document, any applicable withholding tax that was required to be withheld from any prior payment to such Lender but which was not so withheld, as well as any other amounts for which Administrative Agent is entitled to indemnification from such Lender.13.9Resignation of Agent.(a)Any Agent may resign at any time by delivering notice of such resignation to Lenders and Borrower, effective on the date set forth in such notice or, if no such date is set forth therein, upon the date such notice shall be effective in accordance with the terms​85​​of this Section 13.9.  If any Agent delivers any such notice, Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be.  If, after thirty (30) days after the date of retiring Agent’s notice of resignation, no successor Agent has been appointed by Required Lenders that has accepted such appointment, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of Lenders, appoint a successor Agent from among Lenders.  Each appointment under this clause (a) shall be subject to the prior consent of Borrower, which may not be unreasonably withheld but shall not be required during the continuance of an Event of Default.(b)Effective immediately upon its resignation, (i) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents, (ii) Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of such Agent until a successor Agent shall have accepted a valid appointment hereunder, (iii) the retiring Agent and its Related Persons shall no longer have the benefit of any provision of any Loan Document other than with respect to any actions taken or omitted to be taken while such retiring Agent was, or because such Agent had been, validly acting as Agent under the Loan Documents and (iv) the retiring Agent shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary to assign to the successor Agent its rights as Agent under the Loan Documents.  Effective immediately upon its acceptance of a valid appointment as Agent, a successor Agent shall succeed to, and become vested with, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent under the Loan Documents.13.10Release of Collateral or Guarantors.  Each Lender hereby consents to the release and hereby directs Agent to release (or, in the case of Section 13.10(b)(ii) below, release or subordinate) the following:(a)any Subsidiary of Borrower from its guaranty of any Obligation if all of the Equity Interests of such Subsidiary owned by any Credit Party are sold or transferred in a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents (including pursuant to a waiver or consent); and(b)any Lien held by Administrative Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties against (i) any Collateral that is sold, transferred, conveyed or otherwise disposed of by a Credit Party in a transaction permitted by the Loan Documents (including pursuant to a waiver or consent), (ii) any property subject to a Lien permitted hereunder and (iii) all of the Collateral and all Credit Parties, upon (A) the Termination Date, and (B) to the extent requested by Administrative Agent, receipt by Administrative Agent and Secured Parties of liability releases from the Credit Parties each in form and substance acceptable to Administrative Agent.Each Lender hereby directs Administrative Agent, and Administrative Agent hereby agrees, upon receipt of notice from Borrower, to execute and deliver or file such documents and to perform other actions reasonably necessary to release the guaranties and Liens when and as directed in this Section 13.10.13.11Erroneous Payments.(a)If Administrative Agent notifies a Lender or Secured Party, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender or Secured Party such Lender or such Secured​86​​Party or other recipient, a “Payment Recipient”) that Administrative Agent has determined in its sole discretion (whether or not after receipt of any notice under immediately succeeding clause (b)) that any funds received by such Payment Recipient from Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Lender, Secured Party or other Payment Recipient on its behalf)  (any such funds, whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise, individually and collectively, an “Erroneous Payment”) and demands the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of Administrative Agent and shall be segregated by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the benefit of Administrative Agent, and such Lender or Secured Party shall (or, with respect to any Payment Recipient who received such funds on its behalf, shall cause such Payment Recipient to) promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter, return to Administrative Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made, in same day funds (in the currency so received), together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to Administrative Agent in same day funds at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect. A notice of Administrative Agent to any Payment Recipient under this clause (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.(b)Without limiting immediately preceding clause (a), each Lender or Secured Party, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender or Secured Party such Lender, hereby further agrees that if it receives a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise) from Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates), or (z) that such Lender or Secured Party, or other such recipient, otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) in each case:(i)(A) in the case of immediately preceding clauses (x) or (y), an error shall be presumed to have been made (absent written confirmation from Administrative Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error has been made (in the case of immediately preceding clause (z)), in each case, with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment; and(ii)such Lender or Secured Party shall (and shall cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of such error) notify Administrative Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 13.11(b).​87​​(c)Each Lender or Secured Party hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or Secured Party under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by Administrative Agent to such Lender or Secured Party from any source, against any amount due to Administrative Agent under immediately preceding clause (a) or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement.(d)In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by Administrative Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by Administrative Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and/or from any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its respective behalf)  (such unrecovered amount, an “Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency”), upon Administrative Agent’s notice to such Lender at any time, (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Loans (but not its Commitments) of the relevant Class with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the “Erroneous Payment Impacted Class”) in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as Administrative Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Loans (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment  Impacted Class, the “Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment”) at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by Administrative Agent in such instance), and is hereby (together with Borrower) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment Agreement with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and such Lender shall deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to Borrower or Administrative Agent, (ii) Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to acquire the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (iii) upon such deemed acquisition, Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender and (iv) Administrative Agent may reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the Loans subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Loans acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Loan (or portion thereof), and Administrative Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender (and/or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf). For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender and such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  In addition, each party hereto agrees that, except to the extent that Administrative Agent has sold a Loan (or portion thereof) acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and irrespective of whether Administrative Agent may be equitably subrogated, Administrative Agent shall be contractually subrogated to all the rights and interests of the applicable Lender or Secured Party under the Loan Documents with respect to each Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (the “Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights”).​88​​(e)The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by Borrower or any other Credit Party, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is made with funds of Borrower or any other Credit Party.(f)To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to  an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine.(g)Each party’s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 13.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of Administrative Agent, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.14.MISCELLANEOUS14.1No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of Lender, any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.  No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case shall, of itself, entitle it to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.  The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are

otherwise dispose of the Collateral.  Each Credit Party further agrees, jointly and severally, to indemnify Agents and Lenders from and agrees to hold it harmless against any documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by any governmental authority by reason of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.(b)Each Credit Party agrees, jointly and severally, to indemnify Agents, Lenders, their correspondents and each of their respective directors, shareholders, officers,​91​​employees and agents (each, an “Indemnified Person”) against, and agrees to hold each Indemnified Person harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, charges and disbursements, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnified Person arising out of, in any way connected with or as a result of (i) the use of any of the proceeds of any Loan, (ii) the transactions financed by the Loans, (iii) this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other document contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto or thereto of their respective obligations hereunder and thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or (iv) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceedings relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnified Person Indemnity is a party thereto; provided, however, that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnified Person, apply to any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses to the extent that they result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party.(c)The provisions of this Section 14.3 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement and the repayment of the Loans.  All amounts due under this Section 14.3 shall be payable on written demand therefor.14.4Guaranty.  Each Guarantor hereby, jointly and severally, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to Secured Parties and its successors and assigns the full and prompt payment (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) and performance of all Obligations owed or hereafter owing to Secured Parties by Borrower.  Each Guarantor agrees that its guaranty obligation hereunder is a continuing guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection, and that its obligations shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and unaffected by:(a)the genuineness, validity, regularity, enforceability or any future amendment of, or change in, this Agreement, any other Loan Documents;(b)the absence of any action to enforce this Agreement (including this Section 14.4) or any other Loan Document or the waiver or consent by any Secured Party with respect to any of the provisions hereof or thereof;(c)the existence, value or condition of, or failure to perfect its Lien against, any security for the Obligations or any action, or the absence of any action, by any Secured Party in respect thereof (including the release of any such security);(d)the insolvency of any Credit Party; or(e)any other action or circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor,it being agreed by each Guarantor that its obligations shall not be discharged until the payment and performance, in full, of the Obligations has occurred.  Each Guarantor shall be regarded, and shall be in the same position, as principal debtor with respect to the Obligations guaranteed hereunder.​92​​14.5Waivers.  Each Credit Party expressly waives all rights it may have now or in the future under any statute, or at common law, or at law or in equity, or otherwise, to compel any Agent or any Lender to marshal assets or to proceed in respect of the Obligations against any other Credit Party, any other party or against any security for the payment and performance of the Obligations before proceeding against, or as a condition to proceeding against, such Credit Party.  It is agreed among each Credit Party, Agents and Lenders that the foregoing waivers are of the essence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and that, but for the provisions of this Section 14.5 and such waivers, Lenders would decline to enter into this Agreement.14.6Benefit of Guaranty.  Each Credit Party agrees that the provisions of Section 14.4 are for the benefit of Agents and Lenders and their respective successors, transferees, endorsees and assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair, as between any other Credit Party and any Secured Party, the obligations of such other Credit Party under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.14.7Subordination of Subrogation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other Loan Documents, each Credit Party hereby expressly and irrevocably subordinates to payment of the Obligations any and all rights at law or in equity to subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or set off and any and all defenses available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor until the Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no claims have been made) are paid in full in cash.  Each Credit Party acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is intended to benefit Agents and Lenders and shall not limit or otherwise affect such Credit Party’s liability hereunder or the enforceability of Section 14.4.14.8Election of Remedies.  If any Agent or any Lender may, under applicable law, proceed to realize its benefits under this Agreement or any other Loan Document giving Administrative Agent a Lien upon any Collateral, whether owned by Borrower or by any other Person, either by judicial foreclosure or by non-judicial sale or enforcement, Agent sand Lenders may, at its sole option, determine which of its remedies or rights it may pursue without affecting any of its rights and remedies under Section 14.4.  If, in the exercise of any of its rights and remedies, any Secured Party shall forfeit any of its rights or remedies, including its right to enter a deficiency judgment against any Credit Party or any other Person, whether because of any applicable laws pertaining to “election of remedies” or the like, each Credit Party hereby consents to such action by Agents and Lenders and waives any claim based upon such action, even if such action by any Agent or any Lender shall result in a full or partial loss of any rights of subrogation which such Credit Party might otherwise have had but for such action by any Agent or any Lender.  Any election of remedies that results in the denial or impairment of the right of any Agent or any Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any Credit Party shall not impair any other Credit Party’s obligation to pay the full amount of the Obligations.  In the event any Agent or any Lender shall bid at any foreclosure or trustee’s sale or at any private sale permitted by law, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Agent or such Lender may bid all or less than the amount of the Obligations and the amount of such bid need not be paid by such Agent or such Lender but may be credited against the Obligations.  The difference between such bid amount and the remaining​93​​balance of the Obligations shall be conclusively deemed to be the amount of the Obligations guaranteed under Section 14.4 notwithstanding that any present or future law or court decision or ruling may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to which any Agent or any Lender might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at any such sale.14.9Liability Cumulative.  The liability of Credit Parties under Section 14.4 is in addition to and shall be cumulative with all liabilities of each Credit Party to Secured Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in respect of any Obligations or obligation of the other Credit Parties, without any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or agreement evidencing or creating such other liability specifically provides to the contrary.14.10Waiver of Subrogation.  Each Credit Party expressly waives any and all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnity, exoneration, contribution of any other claim which any Credit Party may now or hereafter have against the other Credit Party or other Person directly or contingently liable for the Obligations hereunder, or against or with respect to the other Credit Party’s property (including, without limitation, any property which is Collateral for the Obligations), arising from the existence or performance of this Agreement, until termination of this Agreement and repayment in full of the Obligations.14.11Assignments and Participations; Binding Effect.(a)Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by Borrower, the other Credit Parties signatory hereto and Agents and when Administrative Agent shall have been notified by each Lender that such Lender has executed it.  Thereafter, it shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of, but only to the benefit of, Borrower, the other Credit Parties hereto, Agent, each Lender receiving the benefits of the Loan Documents and each other Secured Party and, in each case, their respective successors and permitted assigns.  Except as expressly provided in any Loan Document none of Borrower, any other Credit Party, or any Agent shall have the right to assign any rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein.(b)Right to Assign.  Each Lender may sell, transfer, negotiate or assign (each, an “Assignment”) all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder (including all or a portion of its Commitments and its rights and obligations with respect to Loans) to (i) any Eligible Assignee, (ii) any other Person acceptable (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to Administrative Agent and as long as no Event of Default is continuing, Borrower (which acceptances shall be deemed to have been given unless an objection is delivered to Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after notice of a proposed Assignment is delivered to Borrower), or (iii) with respect to the Term Loans, to any Person other than a Credit Party, and Affiliate of a Credit Party, or a natural person; provided, however, that (w) for each Loan, the aggregate outstanding principal amount (determined as of the Closing Date of the applicable Assignment) of the Loans, and Commitments subject to any such Assignment shall be in a minimum amount of $2,000,000, unless such Assignment is made to an existing Lender or an Eligible Assignee of any existing Lender, is of the assignor’s (together with its Eligible Assignees) entire interest in such facility or is made with the prior consent of Borrower (to the extent required)​94​​and Administrative Agent, (x) such Assignment shall be effective only upon the acknowledgement in writing of such sale by Administrative Agent (such acknowledgment not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), and (y) interest accrued prior to and through the date of any such Assignment may not be assigned.(c)Procedure.  The parties to each sale made in reliance on clause (b) above (other than those described in clause (e) or (f) below) shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment Agreement evidencing such sale, together with any existing Note subject to such sale (or any affidavit of loss therefor acceptable to Administrative Agent), any tax forms required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement and payment of an assignment fee in the amount of $3,500 to Administrative Agent, unless waived or reduced by Administrative Agent; provided, that (i) if a sale by a Lender is made to an Affiliate or an Approved Fund of such assigning Lender, then no assignment fee shall be due in connection with such sale, and (ii) if a sale by a Lender is made to an assignee that is not an Affiliate or Approved Fund of such assignor Lender, and concurrently to one or more Affiliates or Approved Funds of such Assignee, then only one assignment fee of $3,500 shall be due in connection with such sale (unless waived or reduced by Agent).  Upon receipt of all the foregoing, and conditioned upon such receipt and, if such assignment is made in accordance with clause (iii) of Section 14.11(b), upon Administrative Agent (and Borrower, if applicable) consenting to such Assignment, from and after the Closing Date specified in such Assignment, Agent shall record or cause to be recorded in the Register the information contained in such Assignment Agreement.(d)Effectiveness.  Subject to the recording of an Assignment Agreement by Agent in the Register, (i) the assignee thereunder shall become a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations under the Loan Documents have been assigned to such assignee pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender, (ii) any applicable Note shall be transferred to such assignee through such entry and (iii) the assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations under this Agreement have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, relinquish its rights (except for those surviving the termination of the Commitments and the payment in full of the Obligations) and be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents, other than those relating to events or circumstances occurring prior to such Assignment (and, in the case of an Assignment Agreement covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).(e)Grant of Security Interests.  In addition to the other rights provided in this Section 14.11, each Lender may grant a security interest in, or otherwise assign as collateral, any of its rights under this Agreement, whether now owned or hereafter acquired (including rights to payments of principal or interest on the Loans), to (A) any federal reserve bank (pursuant to Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Board), without notice to Administrative Agent or (B) any holder of, or trustee for the benefit of the holders of, such Lender’s indebtedness or equity securities, by notice to Administrative Agent; provided, however, that no such holder or trustee, whether because of such grant or assignment or any foreclosure thereon (unless such foreclosure is made through an assignment in accordance with clause (b) above), shall be entitled to any rights of such Lender hereunder and no such Lender shall be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder.​95​​(f)Participants and SPVs.  In addition to the other rights provided in this Section 14.11, each Lender may, (x) with notice to Administrative Agent, grant to an SPV the option to make all or any part of any Loan that such Lender would otherwise be required to make hereunder (and the exercise of such option by such SPV and the making of Loans pursuant thereto shall satisfy the obligation of such Lender to make such Loans hereunder) and such SPV may assign to such Lender the right to receive payment with respect to any Obligation and (y) without notice to or consent from Administrative Agent or Borrower, sell participations to one or more Persons in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents; provided, however, that, whether as a result of any term of any Loan Document or of such grant or participation, (i) no such SPV or participant shall have a commitment, or be deemed to have made an offer to commit, to make Loans hereunder, and, except as provided in the applicable option agreement, none shall be liable for any obligation of such Lender hereunder, (ii) such Lender’s rights and obligations, and the rights and obligations of the Credit Parties and Secured Parties towards such Lender, under any Loan Document shall remain unchanged and each other party hereto shall continue to deal solely with such Lender, which shall remain the holder of the Obligations in the Register, except that (A) each such participant and SPV shall be entitled to the benefit of Sections 3.4 and 3.5, but, with respect to Section 3.4, only to the extent such participant or SPV delivers the tax forms required pursuant to Section 3.4 as if it were a Lender and then only to the extent of any amount to which such Lender would be entitled in the absence of any such grant or participation and (B) each such SPV may receive other payments that would otherwise be made to such Lender with respect to Loans funded by such SPV to the extent provided in a notice provided to Administrative Agent by such SPV and such Lender, provided, however, that in no case (including pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above) shall an SPV or participant have the right to enforce any of the terms of any Loan Document, and (iii) the consent of such SPV or participant shall not be required (either directly, as a restraint on such Lender’s ability to consent hereunder or otherwise) for any amendments, waivers or consents with respect to any Loan Document or to exercise or refrain from exercising any powers or rights such Lender may have under or in respect of the Loan Documents (including the right to enforce or direct enforcement of the Obligations), except for those described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of Section 14.2(a) with respect to amounts, or dates fixed for payment of amounts, to which such participant or SPV would otherwise be entitled and, in the case of participants, except for those described in clause (v) of Section 14.2(a).  No party hereto shall institute (and Borrower shall cause each other Credit Party not to institute) against any SPV grantee of an option pursuant to this clause (f) any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper of such SPV; provided, however, that each Lender having designated an SPV as such agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person against any liability that may be incurred by, or asserted against, such Indemnified Person as a result of failing to institute such proceeding (including a failure to be reimbursed by such SPV for any such liability).  The agreement in the preceding sentence shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the payment in full of the Obligations.(g)A Lender that makes a grant to an SPV or sells a participation pursuant to Section 14.11(f) shall, acting solely as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower and the other Credit Parties, maintain a register similar to the Register (the “Participant Register”) on which it enters the name and address of each participant or SPV and the principal amounts (and stated​96​​interest) of each participant’s or SPV’s interest in the Loans or other Obligations under the Loan Documents.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such interest for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.14.12Set-off; Sharing of Payments.(a)Right of Setoff.  Each of each Agent, each Lender and each Affiliate (including each branch office thereof) of any of them is hereby authorized, without notice or demand (each of which is hereby waived by each Credit Party), at any time and from time to time during the continuance of any Event of Default and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (whether general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness, claims or other obligations at any time owing by Agent, such Lender or any of their respective Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of Borrower or any other Credit Party against any Obligation of any Credit Party now or hereafter existing, whether or not any demand was made under any Loan Document with respect to such Obligation and even though such Obligation may be unmatured.  No Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff without the prior consent of Administrative Agent or Required Lenders. Each Agent and each Lender agrees promptly to notify Borrower and Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender or its Affiliates; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  The rights under this Section 14.12 are in addition to any other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that Agents, Lenders, their Affiliates and the other Secured Parties, may have.(b)Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender or any Agent directly or through an Affiliate or branch office thereof, obtains any payment of any Obligation of any Credit Party (whether voluntary, involuntary or through the exercise of any right of setoff or the receipt of any Collateral or Proceeds) and such payment exceeds the amount such Agent, such Lender would have been entitled to receive if all payments had gone to, and been distributed by, Agent in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Documents, such Agent or such Lender shall purchase for cash from other Lenders such participations in their Obligations as necessary for such Lender to share such excess payment with such Lenders to ensure such payment is applied as though it had been received by Agent and applied in accordance with this Agreement (or, if such application would then be at the discretion of Borrower, applied to repay the Obligations in accordance herewith); provided, however, that (i) if such payment is rescinded or otherwise recovered from such Lender or Agent in whole or in part, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price therefor shall be returned to such Lender or such Agent without interest and (ii) such Lender or such Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, be able to exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender, Agent were the direct creditor of the applicable Credit Party in the amount of such participation.​97​​14.13Creditor-Debtor Relationship.  The relationship between each Agent and each Lender, on the one hand, and the Credit Parties, on the other hand, is solely that of creditor and debtor.  No Secured Party has any fiduciary relationship or duty to any Credit Party arising out of or in connection with, and there is no agency, tenancy or joint venture relationship between Secured Parties and Credit Parties by virtue of, any Loan Document or any transaction contemplated therein.14.14Actions in Concert.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, each Lender hereby agrees with each other Lender that no Lender shall take any action to protect or enforce its rights against any Credit Party arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including exercising any rights of setoff) without first obtaining the prior written consent of Agents or Required Lenders, it being the intent of Lenders that any such action to protect or enforce rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be taken in concert and at the direction or with the consent of Agents or Required Lenders.14.15Descriptive Headings.  The descriptive headings of the various provisions of this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions hereof.14.16Notices.  Except as otherwise provided herein, whenever any notice, demand, request or other communication shall or may be given to or served upon any party by any other party, or whenever any party desires to give or serve upon any other party any communication with respect to this Agreement, each such communication shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been validly served, given or delivered (a) upon the earlier of actual receipt and three (3) days after deposit in the United States Mail, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, with proper postage prepaid, (b) upon transmission, when sent by telecopy or other similar facsimile transmission (with such telecopy or facsimile promptly confirmed by delivery of a copy by pe

ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED IN SUCH STATE, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF14.22Reinstatement.  This Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment of all or any part of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned or restored by any Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Credit Party, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.14.23PATRIOT Act; Know Your Customer.(a)Each Lender that is subject to the requirements of the PATRIOT Act hereby notifies each Credit Party that pursuant to the requirements of the PATRIOT Act, it may be required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Credit Party, which information includes the name and address of each Credit Party and other information that will allow such Lender to identify each Credit Party in accordance with the PATRIOT Act.(b)Each Lender shall promptly upon the request of Administrative Agent supply, or procure the supply of, such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by Administrative Agent (for itself) in order for Administrative Agent to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with all necessary “know your customer” or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations pursuant to the transactions contemplated in the Loan Documents14.24Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Lenders.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender arising under any Loan Document may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of a Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:(a)the application of any Write-Down
