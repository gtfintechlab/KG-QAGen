Interest on  Loans shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date.3.2    Payments Generally.(a)    No Deductions; Place and Time of Payments.  All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent’s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there exists a Defaulting Lender, each payment by the Borrower to such Defaulting Lender hereunder shall be applied in accordance with Section 3.16(b).(b)    Payment Dates.  Subject to the definition of “Interest Period,” if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.(c)    Advances by Administrative Agent.  Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the time any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto.  If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then:(i)    if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and(ii)    if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand  pay  to  the  Administrative  Agent  the  amount  thereof  in  immediately  available funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available  by  the  Administrative  Agent  to  the  Borrower  to  the  date  such  amount  is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the “Compensation Period”) at a rate per annum equal  to  the  Federal  Funds  Rate  from  time  to  time  in  effect.   If  such  Lender  pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing.  If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith  upon  the  Administrative  Agent’s  demand  therefor,  the  Administrative  Agent may  make  a  demand  therefor  upon  the  Borrower,  and  the  Borrower  shall  pay  such 21amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to such Borrowing.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.(d)    Several Obligations.  The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan.(e)    Funding Offices.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.3.3    Prepayments.Voluntary Prepayments.  The Borrower shall have the right to prepay the Loans in whole or in part from time to time without premium or penalty; provided, however, that (i) all prepayments under this Section 3.3(a) shall be subject to Section 3.14, (ii) Eurodollar Loans may only be prepaid on three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, (iii) each such partial prepayment of Eurodollar Loans shall be in the minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000, and (iv) each such partial prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in the minimum principal amount of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000, or, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), if less than such minimum amounts, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding.  Amounts prepaid pursuant to this Section 3.3(a) shall be applied as the Borrower may elect based on the Lenders’ Pro Rata Shares; provided, however, if the Borrower fails to specify, such prepayment shall be applied by the Administrative Agent, subject to Section 3.7, in such manner as it deems reasonably appropriate. 3.4    [Reserved].3.5    Payment in Full at Maturity.On the Maturity Date, the entire outstanding principal balance of all Loans, together with accrued but unpaid interest and all fees and other sums owing under the Loan Documents, shall be due and payable in full, unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 9.2; provided that if the Maturity Date is not a Business Day, then such principal, interest, fees and other sums shall be due and payable in full on the next preceding Business Day.3.6    Computations of Interest and Fees.(a)    Calculation of Interest and Fees.  Except for Base Rate Loans that are based upon the Prime Rate, in which case interest shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, all computations of interest and fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days.  Interest shall accrue from and including the first date of Borrowing (or continuation or conversion) to  but  excluding  the  last  day  occurring  in  the  period  for  which  such  interest is payable.  Each 22determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.(b)    Usury.  It is the intent of the Lenders and the Borrower to conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury Law from time to time in effect.  All agreements between the Lenders and the Borrower are hereby limited by the provisions of this subsection which shall override and control all such agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral.  In no way, nor in any event or contingency (including but not limited to prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any Borrower Obligation), shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, or received under this Loan Agreement, under the Notes or otherwise, exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permissible under applicable Law.  If, from any possible construction of any of the Loan Documents or any other document, interest would otherwise be payable in excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, any such construction shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection and such documents shall be automatically reduced to the maximum nonusurious amount permitted under applicable Law, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new document.  If any Lender shall ever receive anything of value which is characterized as interest on the Loans under applicable Law and which would, apart from this provision, be in excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, an amount equal to the amount which would have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the Loans and not to the payment of interest, or refunded to the Borrower or the other payor thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans.  The right to demand payment of the Loans or any other Indebtedness evidenced by any of the Loan Documents does not include the right to accelerate the payment of any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such demand, and the Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of such demand.  All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest on account of the Loans does not exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permitted by applicable Law.3.7    Pro Rata Treatment.Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Loan, each payment of interest, each payment of fees (other than administrative fees, if any, paid to the Administrative Agent) and each conversion or continuation of any Loans, shall be allocated pro rata among the relevant Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares; provided that, if any Lender shall have failed to pay its Pro Rata Share of any Loan, then any amount to which such Lender would otherwise be entitled pursuant to this Section 3.7 shall instead be payable to the Administrative Agent until the share of such Loan not funded or purchased by such Lender has been repaid.  In the event any principal, interest, fee or other amount paid to any Lender pursuant to this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent, (a) such principal, interest, fee or other amount that had been satisfied by such payment shall be revived, reinstated and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not occurred and (b) such Lender shall, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so paid to such Lender, with interest for the period commencing on the date such payment is returned by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent receives such repayment at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate if repaid within two (2) Business Days after such request and thereafter the Base Rate.233.8    Sharing of Payments.The Lenders agree among themselves that, except to the extent otherwise provided herein, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan or any other obligation owing to such Lender under this Loan Agreement through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker’s lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable Debtor Relief Law or other similar Law or otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such payment as provided for in this Loan Agreement, such Lender shall promptly pay in cash or purchase from the other Lenders a participation in such Loans and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders share such payment in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares.  The Lenders further agree among themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker’s lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be returned, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by payment in cash or a repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto) to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise returned.  The Borrower agrees that (a) any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, exercise all rights of payment, including setoff, banker’s lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the amount of such participation and (b) the Borrower Obligations that have been satisfied by a payment that has been rescinded or otherwise returned shall be revived, reinstated and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not occurred.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Loan Agreement, if any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall fail to remit to any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender or the Administrative Agent to such other Lender pursuant to this Loan Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each date from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.  If under any applicable Debtor Relief Law or other similar Law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 3.8 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this Section 3.8 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there exists a Defaulting Lender, all amounts received by such Defaulting Lender hereunder shall be applied in accordance with Section 3.16(b).3.9    Capital Adequacy.If any Lender determines that any Change in Law has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital or assets of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender’s obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy, liquidity requirements and such Lender’s desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction; provided that such determination to charge such additional amounts to the Borrower shall be made in good faith (and not on an arbitrary or capricious basis) and consistent with other similarly situated customers of the applicable Lender after consideration of such factors as such Lender then reasonably determines to be relevant.243.10    Eurodollar Provisions.(a)    If the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (i) deposits in Dollars are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Loan, (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Loan, or (iii) the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Eurodollar Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders.  Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Continuation/Conversion with respect to Eurodollar Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of or, to the extent permitted hereunder, conversion into a Base Rate Loan in the amount specified therein.(b)    In the event ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (or any Person that takes over the administration of such rate) discontinues its administration and publication of interest settlement rates for deposits in Dollars, as determined by the Administrative Agent (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), then (i) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall seek to jointly agree upon an alternate rate of interest to the Eurodollar Base Rate that gives due consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States at such time, and the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall enter into an amendment to this Loan Agreement to reflect such alternate rate of interest and such other related changes to this Loan  Agreement as may be applicable; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 11.6, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Loan Agreement so long as the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five (5) Business Days of the date a copy of such amendment is provided to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that such Required Lenders object to such amendment and (ii) until an alternate rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with this clause (b), (x) any request pursuant to Section 2.3 that requests the conversion of Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans, or continuation of any Eurodollar Loans, shall be ineffective and any such Borrowing shall be continued as or converted to, as the case may be, a Base Rate Loan, and (y) if any request pursuant to Section 2.1 requests a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, such Borrowing shall be made as a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans; provided that, if such alternate rate of interest shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Loan Agreement.3.11    Illegality.If any Lender determines that any Requirement of Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, or  materially  restricts  the  authority  of  such  Lender  to  purchase  or  sell,  or  to  take  deposits  of  Dollars in the London interbank market, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such  Lender  to  make  or  continue  Eurodollar  Loans  or  Base  Rate  Loan  as  to  which  the  interest  rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Base Rate or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances  giving  rise  to  such  determination  no  longer  exist.   Upon  receipt  of  such  notice,  the Borrower  shall,  upon  demand  to  the  Borrower  from  such  Lender  (with  a  copy  to  the  Administrative Agent),  prepay  or,  if  applicable,  convert  all  Eurodollar  Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans as to 25which the interest rate is not determined with reference to the Eurodollar Base Rate, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any amounts due with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.14.3.12    Requirements of Law.If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines that as a result of any Change in Law, there shall be any increase in the cost to the Administrative Agent or such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding, continuing, converting or maintaining Loans, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this Section 3.12 any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (a) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.13 and the imposition of or change in the rate of any Excluded Taxes and (b) the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage covered by the definition of Eurodollar Rate), then from time to time, upon demand of the Administrative Agent or such Lender (through the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent or such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate the Administrative Agent or such Lender for such increased cost or reduction in yield; provided that, such determination to charge such additional amounts to the Borrower shall be made in good faith (and not on an arbitrary or capricious basis) and consistent with other similarly situated customers of the Administrative Agent or applicable Lender after consideration of such factors as the Administrative Agent or such Lender then reasonably determines to be relevant.3.13    Taxes. (a)    Payments Free of Taxes.  Except as required by applicable Law, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required by applicable Law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law.(b)    Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.  Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law.(c)    Indemnification by the Borrower.   The  Borrower  shall  indemnify  the Administrative  Agent  and  each  Lender,  within  ten  (10)  days  after  demand  therefor,  for  the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or such  Lender  or  required  to  be  withheld  or  deducted  from  a  payment  to  the  Administrative  Agent  or such  Lender  and  any  reasonable  expenses  arising  therefrom  or  with  respect  thereto,  whether  or  not  such  Indemnified  Taxes  were  correctly  or  legally  imposed  or  asserted  by  the relevant Governmental Authority; provided that the Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify the Administrative Agent or any Lender for any amount in respect of any such penalties, interest or reasonable  expenses  if  written  demand  therefor  was  not  made  by  the  Administrative  Agent or  such  Lender  within  180  days  from  the  date  on  which  such  party  makes  payment  for such 26penalties, interest or expenses; provided further that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any such penalties, interest or reasonable expenses arising out of the retroactive application of any such Indemnified Tax.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  In addition, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for any incremental Taxes that may become payable by such Administrative Agent or Lender (or its beneficial owners) as a result of any failure of the Borrower to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate Governmental Authority or to deliver to such Administrative Agent, pursuant to clause (d) below, documentation evidencing the payment of Taxes.(d)    Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.(e)    Status of Lenders.  (i)  Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than the documentation described below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of the Lender.  (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person,(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Loan Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;(B)  any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in  such  number  of  copies  as  shall  be  requested  by  the  recipient)  on  or  prior  to  the  date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Loan Agreement (and from time to time27thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:(i)  duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8 BEN-E claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party;(ii)  duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;(iii)  in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or(iv) any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.(C)  If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (C), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Loan Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.(f)    Treatment of Certain Refunds.   If  the  Administrative  Agent  or  a  Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including additional amounts paid by the Borrower  pursuant  to  this  Section),  it  shall  pay  to  the  applicable  indemnifying  party  an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the applicable indemnifying party, upon the request of the Administrative  Agent  or  such  Lender,  agrees  to  repay  the  amount  paid  over  pursuant  to  this Section  (plus  any  penalties,  interest  or  other  charges  imposed  by  the  relevant  Governmental 28Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the Administrative Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent or Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent or Lender would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.(g)    Indemnification of the Administrative Agent.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.3(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (g).(h)    Survival.  Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations contained in this Section shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of a Lender and the satisfaction, discharge or payment in full of the Borrower Obligations and the termination of the Commitments.3.14    Compensation.Upon the written demand of any Lender, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:(a)    any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or(b)    any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Eurodollar Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Eurodollar Loan on the date or in the amount previously requested by the Borrower.The amount each such Lender shall be compensated pursuant to this Section 3.14 shall include, without limitation, (i) any loss incurred by such Lender in connection with the re‑employment of funds prepaid, repaid, not borrowed or paid, as the case may be and (ii) any reasonable out‑of‑pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) incurred and reasonably attributable thereto.29For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.14, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Loan was in fact so funded.    3.15    Determination and Survival of Provisions.All determinations by the Administrative Agent or a Lender of amounts owing under Sections 3.9 through 3.14, inclusive, shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto and all amounts owing thereunder shall be due and payable within ten (10) Business Days of demand therefor.  In determining such amount, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.  Section 3.9 through 3.14, inclusive, shall survive the termination of this Loan Agreement and the payment of all Borrower Obligations.3.16    Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Loan Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:(a)    Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Loan Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 11.6.(b)    Reallocation of Payments.  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.2), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Loan Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Loan Agreement, fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Administrative Agent or any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Loan Agreement; fifth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Loan Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (i) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (ii) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender.  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 3.16(b) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.    30(c)    Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.3.17    Mitigation Obligations.If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.9 or Section 3.12 or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.13 or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.11, then, at the request of the Borrower, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.9, Section 3.12 or Section 3.13, as the case may be, in the future or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.11, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.SECTION 4  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 4.1    Closing Conditions.The obligation of the Lenders to enter into this Loan Agreement and to make the Loans on the Closing Date is subject to satisfaction of the following conditions:(a)    Executed Loan Documents.

The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.

If  no  such  successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative  Agent  may  on  behalf  of  the  Lenders,  appoint  a  successor  Administrative  Agent  meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the  Lenders  that  no  qualifying  Person  has  accepted  such  appointment,  then  such  resignation  shall nonetheless  become  effective  in  accordance  with  such  notice  and  (a)  the  retiring  Administrative  Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders  appoint  a  successor  Administrative  Agent  as  provided  for  above  in  this  Section.

After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Section and Section 11.5 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub‑agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.10.7    Non‑Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Loan Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Loan Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder and in deciding whether or the extent to which it will continue as a Lender or assign or otherwise transfer its rights, interests and obligations hereunder.10.8    No Other Duties, Etc.Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the bookrunners, arrangers or agents listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender.None of the Lenders, if any, identified in this Loan Agreement as a Syndication Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Loan Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such.

pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent

any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise(a)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Borrower Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the

Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Section 11.5.Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Borrower Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.The Administrative Agent shall have the exclusive right on behalf of the Lenders to enforce the payment of the principal of and interest on any Loan

Nothing in this Loan Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Loan Agreement.(b)    Assignments by Lenders.  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Loan Agreement (including all or a portion of its Loans at the time owing to it); provided that(i)    except  in  the  case  of  an  assignment  of  the  entire  remaining  amount  of  the assigning Lender’s Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the principal  outstanding  balance  of  the  Loans  of  the  assigning  Lender  subject  to  each  such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower  otherwise  consents  (each  such  consent  not  to  be  unreasonably  withheld  or  delayed); 56provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met;(ii)    each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Loan Agreement with respect to the Loans assigned;(iii)    no consent shall be required for any assignment to an Eligible Assignee except to the extent required by paragraph (b)(i) of this Section and, in addition:(A)    the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (y) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided, that the Borrower shall be deemed to have given its consent five (5) Business Days after the date written notice thereof has been delivered by the assigning Lender (through the Administrative Agent) unless such consent is expressly refused by the Borrower prior to such fifth (5th) Business Day; and(B)    the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender.(iv)    Assignment and Assumption.  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 for each assignment (provided, that only one such fee will be payable in connection with simultaneous assignments to two or more Approved Funds by a Lender), and the assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.(v)    No Assignment to Ineligible Institutions.  No such assignment shall be made to any Ineligible Institution. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Loan Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Loan Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Loan Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Loan Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.9, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, and 11.5(b) with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment.  Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Loan Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Loan Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.57(c)    Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Loan Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  In addition, at any time that a request for a consent for a material or substantive change to the Loan Documents is pending, any Lender may request and receive from the Administrative Agent a copy of the Register.(d)    Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than an Ineligible Institution) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Loan Agreement (including all or a portion of its Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Loan Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Loan Agreement.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Loan Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Loan Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Loan Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 11.6 that affects such Participant.  Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.9, 3.12 3.13 and 3.14 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.7 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.8 as though it were a Lender.(e)    Limitations upon Participant Rights.   A  Participant  shall  not  be  entitled  to  receive  any greater  payment  under  Section  3.9,  3.12,  3.13,  or  3.14  than  the  applicable  Lender  would  have  been entitled  to  receive  with  respect  to  the  participation  sold  to  such  Participant,  unless  the  sale  of  the participation  to  such  Participant  is  made  with  the  Borrower’s  prior  written  consent.  A Participant that would  be  a  Foreign  Lender  if  it  were  a  Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.13 unless 58the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.13(e) as though it were a Lender.(f)    Certain Pledges.
