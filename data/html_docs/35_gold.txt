apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders pursuant to this paragraph), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the applicable Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to 
  31 



this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the applicable Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by any

inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by such Borrower to, or entered into by such Borrower with, any Issuing Bank
relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. A Letter of Credit issued by an Issuing Bank will only be of a type approved for issuance hereunder by such Issuing Bank (it being understood and agreed that
standby Letters of Credit shall be deemed of the type that is approved), and issuance, amendment, extension and renewal of Letters of Credit shall be subject to its customary policies and procedures in effect from time to time relating to letters of
credit. An Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank from issuing such
Letter of Credit, or any law, rule, regulation or orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to such Issuing 
  32 



Bank or any request rule, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that
such Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for
which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Effective Date and which such Issuing
Bank in good faith deems material to it. Each Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed, for all purposes of this Agreement (including paragraphs (d) and (e) of this Section), to be a Letter of Credit issued hereunder for the account of
the Company.  (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of
Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit (other than an automatic renewal permitted under this paragraph)), the Company or the applicable Borrowing Subsidiary shall hand deliver or facsimile (or transmit by
electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the recipient) to an Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent, no later than the applicable LC Notice Time, (i) a Notice of LC Request requesting the issuance of a
Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire
(which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of
Credit and (ii) unless otherwise agreed to by the applicable Issuing Bank, a completed and executed letter of credit application on such Issuing Banks standard form. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if
(and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrowers shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the aggregate LC Exposure shall
not exceed $2,000,000,000, (ii) the portion of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by any Issuing Bank shall not exceed the LC Commitment of such Issuing Bank (unless otherwise agreed by such Issuing Bank), (iii) the
Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender shall not exceed the Commitment of such Lender, (iv) the sum of the Total Exposures of all the Lenders shall not exceed the sum of the Commitments of all the Lenders and (v) the sum of the LC
Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit expiring after any Existing Maturity Date, the Swingline Exposure attributable to Swingline Loans maturing after such Existing Maturity Date and the Competitive Loans maturing after such Existing Maturity
Date shall not exceed the sum of the Commitments that shall have been extended to a date after the latest expiration date of such Letters of Credit and the latest maturity date of such Swingline Loans and such Competitive Loans. A Letter of Credit
shall not be issued or renewed (other than any renewal pursuant to automatic renewal provisions thereof after the date on which the applicable Issuing Bank ceases to have the right to prevent such renewal), or amended to increase the stated amount
thereof or extend the expiration date thereof, if the Issuing Bank that is the issuer thereof shall have received 
  33 



written notice from the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent or the Company, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance, renewal or amendment of the applicable Letter
of Credit (or, in the case of an automatic renewal, at least one Business Day prior to the time by which election not to renew must be made by the applicable Issuing Bank), that one or more applicable conditions contained in Section 4.02 shall
not be satisfied. Each Issuing Bank shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) notify the Administrative Agent of each issuance, amendment, renewal, extension or expiry of, and of each drawing under, each Letter of Credit issued by
such Issuing Bank, and shall provide to the Administrative Agent such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank. Without limiting the foregoing, each Issuing Bank
shall deliver a Notice of LC Activity to the Administrative Agent and the Company within one Business Day of the issuance, amendment, renewal, extension or expiry of, and of each drawing under, a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank. Such
Notice of LC Activity shall include, to the extent applicable, (A) a copy of the applicable Letter of Credit (or, if applicable, any amendment thereof), (B) information with respect to the stated amount, beneficiary and expiration date of
such Letter of Credit and (C) information with respect to the amendment, renewal, extension or expiry of, or drawing under, such Letter of Credit. 
(c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the date that is 30 Business Days
prior to the Maturity Date.  (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit
increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank that is the issuer thereof hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing
Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower
on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the applicable Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that (i) its obligation to acquire
participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit, the occurrence
and continuance of a Default or any reduction or termination of the Commitments, or any force majeure or other event that under any rule of law or uniform practices to which any Letter of Credit is subject (including Section 3.14
of ISP 98 or any successor publication of the International Chamber of Commerce) permits a drawing to be made under such Letter of Credit after the expiration thereof or of the Commitments, and (ii) each such payment shall be made without any
offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender further acknowledges and agrees that, in issuing, amending, renewing or extending any Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank shall be entitled to rely, and shall not incur
any liability for relying, upon the representation and warranty of the Borrowers deemed made pursuant to Section 2.06(b) or 4.02. 
  34 


(e) Reimbursement. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a
Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, not later than the next Business Day
following the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if such Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date such LC Disbursement is made, or, if such notice has not been received by
such Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day next following the date on which such Borrower receives such notice by such time; provided that such Borrower may, subject
to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or a Swingline Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent such Issuing Bank
shall have received the proceeds thereof as contemplated by Section 2.07(a), such Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Borrowing. If the
applicable Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from such Borrower in respect thereof and such Lenders Applicable Percentage
thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from such Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans
made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders pursuant to this paragraph), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts
so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the applicable Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank
or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to
reimburse any Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse
such LC Disbursement.  (f) Obligations Absolute. Each Borrowers obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in
paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of
validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any
statement therein 
  35 



being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of
such Letter of Credit, (iv) any force majeure or other event that under any rule of law or uniform practices to which any Letter of Credit is subject (including Section 3.14 of ISP 98 or any successor publication of the
International Chamber of Commerce) permits a drawing to be made under such Letter of Credit after the stated expiration date thereof or of the Commitments or (v) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the
foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, any Borrowers obligations hereunder. None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the
Issuing Banks, or any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of
any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Banks; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any
Issuing Bank from liability to any Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by each Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable
law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Banks failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly
agree that, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised
care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a
Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make
payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.  (g) Disbursement
Procedures. Each Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Each Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the
applicable Borrower by telephone (confirmed in writing) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not
relieve such Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.  (h)
Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the 
  36 



date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that such
Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that, if such Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then
Section 2.13(e) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment, and shall be payable on demand or, if no demand has been made, on the date on which the applicable Borrower reimburses the applicable LC
Disbursement in full.  (i) Replacement of Issuing Banks. Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among
the Company, the Administrative Agent and the successor Issuing Bank, and consented to by the replaced Issuing Bank (such agreements and consent not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld), which agreement shall set forth the LC Commitment of the
successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the
replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing
Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall, unless otherwise provided in such written agreement, remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and, if
any Letters of Credit issued by it shall continue to be outstanding, the obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional
Letters of Credit.  (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the
Company receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposures representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of
cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Issuing Banks and the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC
Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand
or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Company described in clause (g) or (h) of Article VII. The Borrowers also shall deposit cash collateral in accordance with this paragraph as
and to the extent required by Section 2.21. Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as 
  37 



collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Company and the Borrowing Subsidiaries under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the risk
and expense of the Borrowers, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse any Issuing Bank
for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Company and the Borrowing Subsidiaries for the LC Exposure at such time or, if
the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to (i) the consent of Lenders with LC Exposures representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure and (ii) in the case of any such application at a time when any Lender
is a Defaulting Lender (but only if, after giving effect thereto, the remaining cash collateral shall be less than the aggregate LC Exposure of all the Defaulting Lenders), the consent of each Issuing Bank), be applied to satisfy other obligations
of the Company and the Borrowing Subsidiaries under this Agreement. If the Company is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrowers are required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.21, such amount
(to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrowers as promptly as practicable to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, no Issuing Bank shall have any exposure in respect of any outstanding Letter of Credit
that is not fully covered by the Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders and/or the remaining cash collateral and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. 
(k) Designation of Additional Issuing Banks. From time to time, the Company may by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
designate as additional Issuing Banks one or more Lenders (or any Affiliate of any such Lender as agreed between such Lender and the Company) that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below. The acceptance by a Lender or such Lenders
Affiliate of any appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder shall be evidenced by a written agreement among the Company, the Administrative Agent and such accepting Lender or its Affiliate, as the case may be, which shall set forth the LC Commitment
of such Lender or its Affiliate, as the case may be, and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and
(ii) references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as an Issuing Bank. 
(l) LC Exposure Determination. For all purposes of this Agreement, the amount of a Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any
document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof shall be deemed to be the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases (other than any such increase
consisting of the reinstatement of an amount previously drawn thereunder and reimbursed), whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at the time of determination. 
  38 


SECTION 2.07. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made
by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders, such transfers to be made by
(i) 12:00 p.m., New York City time, in the case of Borrowings other than ABR Borrowings or Fixed Rate Borrowings and (ii) 3:00 p.m., New York City time, in the case of ABR Borrowings or Fixed Rate Borrowings, in each case on the date
such Loan is made; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05. The Administrative Agent will make such amounts available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like
funds, to an account of such Borrower designated by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request or Competitive Bid Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to refinance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in
Section 2.06(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.  (b) Unless the Administrative Agent
shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not
in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with
interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective
Rate or (ii) in the case of a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. 
SECTION 2.08. Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request or as otherwise provided in Section 2.03. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to
convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The applicable Borrower may elect different options
with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a
separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Competitive Borrowings or Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued. 
  39 


(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, a Borrower, or the Company on its behalf, shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made
on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the
Administrative Agent and signed by the applicable Borrower, or by the Company on its behalf.  (c) Each telephonic and written Interest
Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:  (i) the Borrowing to which
such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant
to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);  (ii) the effective date of the
election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;  (iii) whether the resulting
Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and  (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar
Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period. 
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to
have selected an Interest Period of seven days (if generally available) or otherwise of one months duration.  (d) Promptly following
receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing. 
(e) If a Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so 
  40 



notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and
(ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. 
SECTION 2.09. Termination, Reduction, Extension and Increase of Commitments. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments and
the LC Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.  (b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the
aggregate amount of the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $10,000,000 and not less than $50,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not terminate or
reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, (A) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender would exceed its Commitment or (B) the sum of the Total
Exposures of all the Lenders would exceed the total Commitments.  (c) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to
terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following
receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments
delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified
effective date), if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders based on their respective Commitments. 
(d) The Company may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders) given not less than 30
days prior to the Maturity Date at any time in effect (but not more than once in any calendar year), request that the Lenders extend the Maturity Date for an additional one-year period (a Maturity Extension Request);
provided that there shall not be more than two extensions of the Maturity Date under this paragraph during the term of this Agreement. Each Lender shall, by notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent given not later than the 20th day
after the date of the Administrative Agents receipt of the Companys Maturity Extension Request, advise the Company whether or not it agrees to the requested extension (each Lender agreeing to a requested extension being called a
Consenting Lender and each Lender declining to agree to a requested extension being called a Declining Lender). Any Lender that has not so advised the Company and the Administrative Agent by such day shall be
deemed to have declined to agree to such extension and shall be a Declining Lender. If Lenders constituting the Required Lenders shall have agreed to a Maturity Extension Request, then the Maturity Date shall, as to the

  41 



Consenting Lenders, be extended by one year to the anniversary of the Maturity Date theretofore in effect. The decision to agree or withhold agreement to any Maturity Extension Request shall
be at the sole discretion of each Lender. The Commitment of each Declining Lender shall terminate on the Maturity Date in effect prior to giving effect to any such extension (such Maturity Date being called the Existing Maturity
Date). The principal amount of any outstanding Loans made by Declining Lenders, together with any accrued interest thereon and any accrued fees and other amounts payable to or for the account of such Declining Lenders hereunder, shall be
due and payable on the Existing Maturity Date, and on the Existing Maturity Date the Borrowers shall also make such other prepayments of their respective Loans pursuant to Section 2.11 as shall be required in order that, after giving effect to
the termination of the Commitments of, and all payments to, Declining Lenders pursuant to this sentence, (i) no Lenders Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed such Lenders Commitment and (ii) the sum of the Total Exposures of
all the Lenders shall not exceed the sum of the Commitments of all the Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received documents consistent with those delivered under Sections 4.01(b) through 4.01(d), and documents consistent with those delivered with respect to each Borrowing Subsidiary under Section 4.03(b), giving effect to such extension, and
(ii) the Maturity Date and the Availability Period, as such terms are used in reference to any Issuing Bank or any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank or in reference to any Swingline Lender or any Swingline Loans, may not be extended
with respect to any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of such Issuing Bank or such Swingline Lender, as applicable (it being understood and agreed that, in the event any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender, as
applicable, shall not have consented to any such extension, (A) such Issuing Bank shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank hereunder, and such Swingline Lender shall continue to have all the rights and
obligations of a Swingline Lender hereunder, in each case through the applicable Existing Maturity Date (or the Availability Period determined on the basis thereof, as applicable), and thereafter shall have no obligation to issue, amend, extend or
renew any Letter of Credit or to make any Swingline Loan, as applicable (but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.15, 2.17, 10.03 and 10.09 as to Letters of Credit issued to Swingline Loans made prior to such
time), and (B) the Borrowers shall cause the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank to be zero no later than the day on which such LC Exposure would have been required to have been reduced to zero in
accordance with the terms hereof without giving effect to the effectiveness of the extension of the applicable Existing Maturity Date pursuant to this paragraph (and, in any event, no later than such Existing Maturity Date) and shall repay the
principal amount of all outstanding Swingline Loans, together with any accrued interest thereon, on the Existing Maturity Date).  (e) The
Company may on one or more occasions, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, executed by the Company and one or more Persons that are Eligible Assignees (any such Persons being called an Increasing Lender), which may
include any Lender, cause new Commitments to be extended by the Increasing Lenders or cause the existing Commitments of the Increasing Lenders to be increased, as the case 
  42 



may be (any such extension or increase, a Commitment Increase), in an amount for each Increasing Lender set forth in such notice; provided that (i) the aggregate
amount of all Commitment Increases effected pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed $1,000,000,000, (ii) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing
Bank and each Swingline Lender (which in each case shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (iii) each Increasing Lender and the Borrowers shall execute and deliver such incremental commitment agreement and such other documentation as
the Administrative Agent shall specify to evidence such Commitment Increase and such Lenders Commitment and/or its status as a Lender hereunder and (iv) no Lender shall be required to participate in any Commitment Increase. On the
effective date (the Increase Effective Date) of any Commitment Increase, (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding (the Outstanding Loans) immediately prior to giving effect to
such Commitment Increase on the Increase Effective Date shall be deemed to be paid; (ii) each Increasing Lender that shall have been a Lender prior to such Commitment Increase shall pay to the Administrative Agent in same day funds an amount
equal to the difference between (A) the product of (1) such Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to such Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Subsequent Borrowings (as hereinafter
defined) and (B) the product of (1) such Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to such Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Outstanding Loans; (iii) each Increasing Lender that
shall not have been a Lender prior to such Commitment Increase shall pay to the Administrative Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the product of (A) such Increasing Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to
such Commitment Increase) multiplied by (B) the amount of the Subsequent Borrowings; (iv) after the Administrative Agent receives the funds specified in clauses (ii) and (iii) above, the Administrative Agent shall pay to each
Non-Increasing Lender the portion of such funds that is equal to the difference between (A) the product of (1) such Non-Increasing Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to such Commitment Increase)
multiplied by (2) the amount of the Outstanding Loans, and (B) the product of (1) such Non-Increasing Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to such Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount
of the Subsequent Borrowings; (v) after the effectiveness of the Commitment Increase, each Borrower shall be deemed to have made new Borrowings (the Subsequent Borrowings) in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Loans attributable to Revolving Loans of such Borrower and of the Types and for the Interest Periods specified in a borrowing request delivered in accordance with Section 2.03; (vi) each
Non-Increasing Lender and each Increasing Lender shall be deemed to hold its Applicable Percentage of each Subsequent Borrowing (each calculated after giving effect to such Commitment Increase); and (vii) the applicable Borrowers shall pay to
each Increasing Lender and each Non-Increasing Lender any and all accrued but unpaid interest on the Outstanding Loans. The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (i) above in respect of each Eurodollar Revolving Loan shall be subject to
indemnification by the applicable Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.16 if the Increase Effective Date occurs other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the
aggregate Commitments (or in the Commitment of any 
  43 


Lender) or addition of a new Lender shall become effective under this paragraph unless,
(i) on the Increase Effective Date, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied (with all references in such paragraphs to a Credit Event being deemed to be references to such increase or
addition) and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents consistent with those delivered under Sections 4.01(b) through 4.01(d), and documents consistent with those delivered with respect to each Borrowing Subsidiary under
Section 4.03(b), giving effect to such increase or addition.  SECTION 2.10. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
(a) Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan made to such Borrower on the Maturity Date applicable to such
Revolving Loan, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Competitive Loan made by such Lender to such Borrower on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan and
(iii) to each Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan made by such Swingline Lender on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the date that is the seventh day after such Swingline Loan is made; provided
that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing or Competitive Borrowing is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding and the proceeds of any such Borrowing shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to prepay all Swingline
Loans then outstanding on a pro rata basis.  (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts
evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender to each such Borrower, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender by each such Borrower from time to time
hereunder.  (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made to each
Borrower hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the
amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lenders share thereof.  (d)
The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall, absent manifest error, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, each Borrower shall prepare, execute and
deliver to such Lender a nonnegotiable promissory note substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B (a Note) payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its

  44 



permitted registered assigns). Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Notes and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by
one or more Notes payable to the payee named therein (or, if such Note is a registered Note, to such payee and its permitted registered assigns). 
SECTION 2.11. Prepayment of Loans. (a) Each Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any
Borrowing made by it in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that the Borrowers shall not have the right to prepay any Competitive Loan without the prior consent of the
Lender thereof; provided, further that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000. 
(b) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of a prepayment of a Swingline Borrowing, each applicable Swingline
Lender) by telephone (confirmed in writing) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of
prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 2:30 p.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline
Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid;
provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is
revoked in accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall
be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Class and Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.
Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.  SECTION 2.12. Fees. (a) The
Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee (a Facility Fee), which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether used or
unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates; provided that, if such Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then
such Facility Fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lenders Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Revolving
Credit Exposure. Accrued Facility Fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date
hereof; provided that any Facility Fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All Facility Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual
number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). 
  45 


(b) Each Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (i) for the account of each
Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower (an LC Participation Fee), which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate used to determine interest on
Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the daily amount of such Lenders LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the
period from and including the Effective Date but excluding the later of the date on which such Lenders Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) for the account of each Issuing Bank a
fronting fee (a Fronting Fee), which shall accrue at a rate equal to 0.15% per annum (or, with respect to any Issuing Bank, such lesser amount as may be agreed between such Issuing Bank and the Company) and be payable on the
aggregate face amount outstanding of the LC Exposure attributable to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for the account of such Borrower (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period
from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as, to each Issuing Bank, such Issuing Banks standard fees with
respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. LC Participation Fees and Fronting Fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each
year shall be payable on the 15th day of the month following such last day (or, if such 15th day is not a Business Day, on the next
succeeding Business Day), commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the
Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to an Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All LC Participation Fees and Fronting Fees shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). 
(c) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders, for their own accounts, fees payable in the amounts and at
the times separately agreed upon between the Company and such other parties.  (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates
due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to an Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of Facility Fees and LC Participation Fees, to the Lenders. Absent manifest error, fees paid
shall not be refundable under any circumstances.  (e) Within 10 days after the end of each fiscal quarter (commencing with the fiscal
quarter ending December 31, 2014), the Administrative Agent shall deliver to 
  46 



the Company a schedule (i) stating the aggregate amount of LC Participation Fees due and payable with respect to such fiscal quarter and (ii) stating the aggregate amount of Fronting
Fees due and payable to each Issuing Bank with respect to such fiscal quarter. Promptly after receipt of each such schedule, (x) the Company shall compare such amounts with its own calculations of the LC Participation Fees and Fronting Fees due
and payable with respect to such fiscal quarter and (y) the Administrative Agent and the Company shall discuss the amounts set forth in each such schedule and shall, subject to the next sentence, agree on the amount of such fees to be paid by
the Borrowers for such fiscal quarter. Neither the failure of the Administrative Agent to deliver any such schedule, nor the inaccuracy of any such schedule, shall relieve any Borrower of its obligations to pay such fees hereunder. In the event any
Borrower pays any such fees based on any such schedule or any such agreement by the Administrative Agent and the Company and the amount so paid by such Borrower is insufficient to satisfy its actual payment obligations under paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section, then such Borrower shall remain liable for any such deficiency and such Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent (for its account, the account of the applicable Issuing Banks and/or the account of the Lenders, as
applicable) the amount of any such deficiency within two Business Days of demand therefor.  SECTION 2.13. Interest. (a) The
Loans comprising each ABR Revolving Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. 
(b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of a Eurodollar
Revolving Loan, the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate or (ii) in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Loan, the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus
(or minus, as applicable) the Margin applicable to such Loan.  (c) Each Fixed Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
the Fixed Rate applicable to such Loan.  (d) Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest, for any day, at a rate per annum equal to the
Swingline Benchmark Rate for such day plus (i) if such Swingline Benchmark Rate is determined by reference to clause (a) of the definition of such term, then the Applicable Rate applicable to Eurodollar Revolving Loans and (ii) if
such Swingline Benchmark Rate is determined by reference to clause (b) of the definition of such term, then the Applicable Rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that if any Swingline Lender shall have provided any notice
pursuant to Section 2.05(c), then from and after the date of such notice (and until the Lenders shall hold no participations in any Swingline Loans) each Swingline Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate
plus the Applicable Rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans.  (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any
Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when 
  47 



due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of
overdue principal of any Loan, 2% per annum plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% per annum plus the rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided above.
 (f) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan; provided that
(i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the
Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment, (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current
Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion and (iv) all accrued interest shall be payable upon termination of the Commitments. 
(g) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the
Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate, LIBO Rate or Swingline Benchmark Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.  SECTION 2.14. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
 (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or 
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (or, in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Loan, the Lender
that is required to make such Loan) that because of a change in circumstances affecting the eurodollar market generally the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost
to such Lenders (or Lender) of making, continuing, converting to or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; 
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice (which may be telephonic) thereof to the Company and the Lenders as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation
of any Revolving 
  48 



Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Revolving Borrowing
and (iii) any request by a Borrower for a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing shall be ineffective; provided that (A) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice do not affect all the Lenders, then requests by a Borrower for
Eurodollar Competitive Borrowings may be made to Lenders that are not affected thereby and (B) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted. 
SECTION 2.15. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement (including any compulsory loan
requirement or insurance charge) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or 
(ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than
Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participations therein; or  (iii)
subject any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (e) of the definition of the term Excluded Taxes and
(C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent of making, converting to,
continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost of such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of
maintaining its obligation to participate in or issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise), then the Borrowers will pay to such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case
may be, for such additional costs or expense incurred or reduction suffered.  (b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change
in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has had or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or Issuing Banks capital or on the capital of such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding
company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments, the Swingline Commitment or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the LC

  49 



Commitment of or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company
could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or Issuing Banks policies and the policies of such Lenders or Issuing Banks holding company with respect to capital adequacy and
liquidity), then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lenders or Issuing Banks
holding company for any such reduction suffered.  (c) If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan to or participating in
any Swingline Loan to or any Letter of Credit issued for the account of, or any Issuing Bank of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit for the account of, any Borrowing Subsidiary is increased (or the amount of any sum received or receivable by
any Lender (or its applicable lending office) or any Issuing Bank is reduced) by an amount deemed in good faith by such Lender or such Issuing Bank to be material, by reason of the fact that such Borrowing Subsidiary is incorporated in, has its
principal place of business in, or borrows from, a jurisdiction outside the United States, such Borrowing Subsidiary shall indemnify such Lender or such Issuing Bank for such increased cost or reduction within 15 days after demand by such
Lender or such Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent). A certificate of such Lender or such Issuing Bank claiming compensation under this paragraph and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder (and
the basis for the calculation of such amount or amounts) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  (d) A certificate of a
Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the
Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
(e) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lenders or such Issuing Banks right to demand such compensation; provided that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section
for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than three months prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of
such Lenders or such Issuing Banks intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the three-month period referred
to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.  (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section, a Lender shall not be entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section in respect of any Competitive Loan if the Change in Law that would otherwise entitle it to such compensation shall have been publicly announced prior to submission of
the Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Loan was made. 
  50 


SECTION 2.16. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any
principal of any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under
Section 2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance herewith), (d) the failure to borrow any Competitive Loan after accepting the Competitive Bid to make such Loan, or (e) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than
on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest
that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of
a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such
Interest Period, over (ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or
an Affiliate of such Lender) for dollar deposits from other banks in the London interbank market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender delivered to the Company setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is
entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
SECTION 2.17. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder shall be made free and
clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 
  51 


(b) In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority
in accordance with applicable law.  (c) The Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within
10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a
Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (d) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent
for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, only to the extent that any Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the
Borrowers to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not
such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this paragraph shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating
the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. 
(e) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Company shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent.  (f) (i) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the
law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall, upon request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, deliver to the Company and the
Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law (including IRS Forms W-8BEN,
W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, or W-8IMY, as applicable, and if such Foreign Lender is relying on the portfolio interest exemption for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, a written statement certifying that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a
bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrowers within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, 
  52 



(C) a controlled foreign corporation described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, and (D) conducting a trade or business in the United States with which the relevant interest
payments are effectively connected) as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. In addition, any Foreign Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Foreign Lender is subject to backup withholding or
information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than any form or statement prescribed by applicable law as a basis for
claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax) shall not be required if in the Foreign Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Foreign Lender to any material unreimbursed
cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Foreign Lender.  (ii) Each Lender
that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a Lender hereunder two properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that such
Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding.  (iii) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would
be subject to U.S. Federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable),
such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent or any agent acting on its behalf as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to
determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(f)(iii),
FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  (g) If any party determines, in its sole
discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including additional amounts paid pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund
(but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), 
  53 



net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to 

y pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by
the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will any indemnified party be required
to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph if such payment would place such indemnified party in a less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than such indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification
payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems
confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.  (h) Each partys obligations under this Section shall survive the
resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or any Issuing Bank, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any
Loan Document.  (i) For purposes of paragraphs (d) and (f) of this Section, the term Lender includes any Issuing
Bank.  SECTION 2.18. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment
required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees, reimbursement of LC Disbursements or of any amounts under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder (or, if no such time
is expressly required, prior to 12:00 p.m., New York City time) on the date when due in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent,
be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to such account of the Administrative Agent as shall be specified by the Administrative Agent, except
that payments required to be made directly to any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender shall be so made and payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative
Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for
payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars. 
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, 
  54 



to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay
principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties. 
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans or participations in
unreimbursed LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the
Revolving Loans and participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount
of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the
payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC
Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any Eligible Assignee. Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing
arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to
the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and
may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. 
  55 


(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to
Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d), 2.06(e), 2.07(b) or 2.18(d), or any other Section hereof requiring any payment for the account of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion
(notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations
are fully paid.  SECTION 2.19. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a
different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment
and delegation (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment and delegation. 
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to
any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, (iii) any Lender shall deliver a notice of illegality to the Company pursuant to Section 2.20, (iv) any Lender becomes a Declining
Lender or (v) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance
with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payment pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17) and obligations under this Agreement (other than any outstanding
Competitive Loans held by it) to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if its consent would be required under Section 10.04, each Issuing Bank and each Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of
an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the
assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments, and in the case of any such assignment and delegation in respect of a Declining Lender, the
assignee shall have consented (and hereby is deemed to have consented) to the extension of the Maturity 
  56 



Date specified in the applicable Maturity Extension Request. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and
Acceptance executed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto. 
SECTION 2.20. Borrowing Subsidiaries. (a) On or after the Effective Date, upon not less than 10 Business Days notice to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the Company may designate any Significant Subsidiary of the Company as a Borrowing Subsidiary by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement executed by such Significant Subsidiary
and the Company, and upon such delivery such Significant Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement; provided that no Subsidiary so designated shall become a Borrowing
Subsidiary if any Lender shall, within 10 Business Days following the Companys notice, notify the Company and the Administrative Agent that (i) it would be unlawful for such Lender or its Affiliates to make or maintain Loans to such
Subsidiary or (ii) such Lender would otherwise be barred by applicable internal policies from making or maintaining Loans to such Subsidiary. If the designation of such Borrowing Subsidiary obligates the Administrative Agent or any Lender to
comply with know your customer or similar identification procedures in circumstances where the necessary information is not previously available to it, the Company shall, promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in order for the Administrative Agent or such Lender to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all
necessary know your customer or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations prior to such Subsidiary being designated a Borrowing Subsidiary. If the Company shall designate as a Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder any
Subsidiary not organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, any Lender may, with notice to the Administrative Agent and the Company, fulfill its Commitment by causing an Affiliate of such Lender to act as the Lender in respect
of such Borrowing Subsidiary and such Lender shall, to the extent of advances made to and participations in Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrowing Subsidiary, be deemed for all purposed hereof to have pro tanto assigned
such advances and participations to such Affiliate in compliance with the provisions of Section 10.04.  (b) Upon the execution by the
Company and delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrowing Subsidiary Termination with respect to any Borrowing Subsidiary, such Subsidiary shall cease to be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement; provided that no
Borrowing Subsidiary Termination will become effective as to any Borrowing Subsidiary (other than to terminate such Borrowing Subsidiarys right to make further Borrowings or obtain Letters of Credit under this Agreement) at a time when any
principal of or interest on any Loan to such Borrowing Subsidiary, or any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrowing Subsidiary, shall be outstanding hereunder or any fees or other amounts remain unpaid with respect thereto. 
  57 


(c) Promptly following receipt of any Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement or Borrowing Subsidiary
Termination, the Administrative Agent shall send a copy thereof to each Lender.  SECTION 2.21. Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: 
(a) the Facility Fee shall cease to accrue on the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a); 
(b) the Commitment, Revolving Credit Exposure, and, if applicable, Competitive Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall not be
included in determining whether the Required Lenders or any other requisite Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to
Section 10.02); provided that any amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or all Lenders affected thereby shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender in accordance with the terms hereof; 
(c) if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then: 
(i) the Swingline Exposure (other than any portion thereof with respect to which such Defaulting Lender shall have funded its
participation as contemplated by Section 2.05(c) and, in the case of any Defaulting Lender that is a Swingline Lender, other than the portion of such Swingline Exposure referred to in clause (b) of the definition of such term) and LC
Exposure of such Defaulting Lender (other than any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements with respect to which such Defaulting Lender shall have funded its participation as contemplated by Sections 2.06(d) and 2.06(e)) shall
be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that (A) the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lenders
Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure (in each case, excluding the portion thereof referred to above) does not exceed the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments and (B) such reallocation does not result in the Revolving Credit
Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender exceeding such Non-Defaulting Lenders Commitment;  (ii) if the reallocation
described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (A) first, prepay the portion

  58 



of such Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure (other than any portion thereof referred to in the parenthetical in such clause (i)) that has not been reallocated and (B) second, cash
collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Banks the portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure (other than any portion thereof referred to in the parenthetical in such clause (i)) that has not been reallocated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 2.06(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;  (iii) if the Borrowers cash
collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrowers shall not be required to pay LC Participation Fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to
such portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure for so long as such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is cash collateralized; 
(iv) if any portion of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the LC
Participation Fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted to give effect to such reallocation; 
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure is neither reallocated nor reduced pursuant to
clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Swingline Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all Facility Fees that otherwise would have been payable pursuant to Section 2.12(a) to such Defaulting
Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lenders Commitment utilized by such Swingline Exposure) shall be payable to the Swingline Lenders (and allocated among them ratably based on the amount of such Defaulting
Lenders Swingline Exposure attributable to Swingline Loans made by each Swingline Lender) until and to the extent that such Swingline Exposure is reallocated and/or reduced to zero; and 
(vi) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant
to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all Facility Fees that otherwise would have been payable pursuant to Section 2.12(a) to such Defaulting
Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lenders Commitment utilized by such LC Exposure) and LC Participation Fees payable pursuant to Section 2.12(b) to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting
Lenders LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Banks (and allocated among them ratably based on the amount of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by each Issuing Bank) until and to the extent
that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and 
  59 


(d) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Swingline Lender shall be
required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, unless, in each case, the related exposure and the Defaulting Lenders then outstanding Swingline Exposure or LC
Exposure, as applicable, will be fully covered by the Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral provided by the Borrowers in accordance with Section 2.21(c), and participating interests in any such funded Swingline Loan
or in any such issued, amended, reviewed or extended Letter of Credit will be allocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.21(c) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein). 
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company, each Issuing Bank and each Swingline Lender each agree that a Defaulting Lender has
adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Commitment and on such date such Lender
shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. 
ARTICLE III  Representations and

corporate or other organizational action and are within such Borrowers corporate or other organizational power, do not require the approval of the equityholders or shareholders, as applicable, of such Borrower, and will not violate any
provision of law or of its certificate of incorporation, memorandum and articles of association, limited liability company agreement or other constitutive document or by-laws, or result in the breach of or constitute a default or require any consent

without limitation, ambient air, surface water, ground water or land), or otherwise relating to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of Hazardous Materials, except to the extent failure
to have any such permit, license or authorization does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries are in compliance with all terms and conditions of all required permits, licenses and authorizations, and
are also in compliance with all other limitations, restrictions, conditions, standards, prohibitions, requirements, obligations, schedules and timetables, contained in those laws or contained in any regulation, code, plan, order, decree, judgment,

ARTICLE VIII 
The Administrative Agent  Each
of the Lenders and Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints the entity named as the Administrative Agent in the heading of this Agreement and its successors to serve as administrative agent under the Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. 
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender, an Issuing Bank or
a Swingline Lender as any other Lender, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial
advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor
to the Lenders, Issuing Banks or Swingline Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those
expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing (and it is
understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)
obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law, and that such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties), (b) the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as
directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in the Loan
Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could expose the Administrative Agent to liability or be contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, rule or regulation,
and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the
request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, 
  75 



under the circumstances as provided in the Loan Documents) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, with such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction by a final and non-appealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof (stating that it is a notice of default) is
given to the Administrative Agent by a Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any
Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in
any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set
forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate,
consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The
Administrative Agent also may rely, and shall not incur any liability for relying, upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and may act upon any such statement prior to receipt of
written confirmation thereof. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for any Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in
accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent, provided that, other than in the case of any such sub-agent that is an Affiliate of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
Agent shall provide prompt written notice of such appointment to the Company. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The
exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of
the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a
successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Company, to appoint one of the Lenders a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the 
  76 



Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may,
on behalf of the Lenders and in consultation with the Company, appoint one of the Lenders as a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. If the
Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Company and the Administrative Agent, remove the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such and, in consultation with the Company, appoint a successor. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative
Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the Administrative Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent. 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any other Lender
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative
Agent, any Issuing Bank or any other Lender, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not
taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.  Each Lender,
by delivering its signature page to this Agreement, or delivering its signature page to an Assignment and Acceptance or any other Loan Document pursuant to which it shall become a Lender hereunder, shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of,
and consented to and approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be delivered to, or be approved by or satisfactory to, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders on the Effective Date. 
None of the Arrangers, the Syndication Agents or the Documentation Agents shall have any duties or obligations under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document (except in its capacity, as applicable, as a Lender or an Issuing Bank), but all such Persons shall have the benefit of the indemnities provided for hereunder. 
  77

Guarantee  In order to induce
the Lenders to extend credit to the Borrowing Subsidiaries hereunder and to induce the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit for the accounts of the Borrowing Subsidiaries hereunder, the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees
the Guaranteed Obligations. The Company further agrees that the due and punctual payment of the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon
its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligation.  The Company waives presentment to,
demand of payment from and protest to any Borrowing Subsidiary of any of its Guaranteed Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment and all other notices, demands and protests and
formalities of any kind which may otherwise constitute grounds for relieving the Company of its obligations hereunder. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case
may be, to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Borrowing Subsidiary under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or agreement; (d) the failure or delay of any Lender or Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations; (e) the failure of any Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under any Loan
Document or any other agreement or instrument; (f) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations; (g) any lack of validity or unenforceability of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document; (h) any change in ownership of any Borrower or any merger or consolidation of any Borrower with any other Person, (i) any other circumstance which may constitute a defense (other than payment in full of the Guaranteed
Obligations) or (j) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company or otherwise operate as a discharge of the Company as a matter of law or equity or which
would impair or eliminate any right of the Company to subrogation.  The Company further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a
promise of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right
to require that any resort be had by any Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in favor of any Borrower or Subsidiary or any other
Person. 
  78 


The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation,
impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations, any
impossibility in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise.  The Company further agrees that its obligations hereunder
shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Lender or Issuing Bank as applicable, upon the
bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrowing Subsidiary or otherwise.  In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other
right which any Lender or Issuing Bank may have at law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Borrowing Subsidiary to pay any Guaranteed Obligation of such Borrowing Subsidiary when and as the same shall become
due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Company hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent (which demand shall not be required if not allowed due to the
existence of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding and is hereby waived by the Company in the event of such circumstances), forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the Lenders and/or the Issuing Banks in cash
an amount equal the unpaid principal amount of such Guaranteed Obligation. The Company further agrees that if payment in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation shall be due in a currency other than dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New
York and if, by reason of any legal prohibition, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Guaranteed Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or,
in the reasonable judgment of any Lender or any Issuing Bank, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of such Lender, the Company shall make payment of such Guaranteed Obligation in dollars (based upon
the applicable exchange rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify such Lender against any losses or expenses (including losses or expenses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates) that it shall sustain as a
result of such alternative payment.  Upon payment in full by the Company of any Guaranteed Obligation, each Lender shall, in a reasonable
manner, assign to the Company the amount of such Guaranteed Obligation owed to such Lender and so paid, such assignment to be pro tanto to the extent to which the Guaranteed Obligation in question was discharged by the Company, or make such
disposition thereof as the Company shall direct (all without recourse to any Lender and without any representation or warranty by any Lender). Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Company against the
applicable Borrowing Subsidiary arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations
owed by such Borrowing Subsidiary to the Lenders.

  80 


(b) Notices and other communications to the Lenders and Issuing Banks hereunder may be delivered
or furnished by electronic communications (including email and Internet and intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices under Article II to any Lender
or Issuing Bank if such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication. Any notices or other communications to the Administrative
Agent or any Borrower may be delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by the recipient thereof prior thereto; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited or rescinded by any such Person
by notice to each other such Person.  (c) Any party hereto may change its address or facsimile number for notices and other communications
hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto.  (d) The Borrowers agree that the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated
to, make any Communication by posting such Communication on Debt Domain, Intralinks, Syndtrak, ClearPar or a substantially similar electronic transmission system (the Platform). The Platform is provided as is and
as available. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties warrants, or shall be deemed to warrant, the adequacy of the Platform and the Administrative Agent expressly disclaims liability for errors or omissions in the
Communications. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made, or
shall be deemed to be made, by the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties in connection with the Communications or the Platform. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties have any liability to any Borrower,
any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any other Person for damages of any kind, including, without limitation, direct or indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of any
Borrowers or the Administrative Agents transmission of Communications through the Platform, except to the extent of direct or actual damages (and not any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages) that are determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or its employees in performing the services hereunder. 
SECTION 10.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in
exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would
otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless 
  81 



the same shall be permitted by this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of such Default at the time.  (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except
pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Company and the Required Lenders or by the Company and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall
(i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon (other than by waiving any default
interest under Section 2.13(e)), or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender and Issuing Bank affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC
Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees or any other amount payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each
Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or 2.18(c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this
Section or the percentage set forth in the definition of Required Lenders or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or
grant any consent hereunder without the written consent of each Lender or (vi) release the Company from its obligations under Article IX without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that (A) no amendment,
modification or waiver of this Agreement or any provision hereof that would alter the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender hereunder shall be effective without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Swingline Lender, as the case may be, and, without limiting the foregoing, any amendment or other modification of Section 2.21 shall require the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent,
each Issuing Bank and each Swingline Lender and (B) notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to first proviso of this paragraph, the Company, the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Banks may enter into agreements referred to in
Sections 2.06(i) and 2.06(k), and the term LC Commitment, as such term is used in reference to any Issuing Bank, may be modified as contemplated by the definition of such term, in each case without consent of the Required Lenders.
 SECTION 10.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrowers agree to pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and each of their respective Affiliates (including the reasonable and documented fees, disbursements and other charges of one firm of counsel for the foregoing, taken as a whole, and, if
reasonably necessary, of one firm of local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction, in connection with the syndication of the credit 
  82 



facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) and (ii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, any Issuing Bank or any Lender (including the reasonable and documented
fees, disbursements and other charges of one firm of counsel for the foregoing, taken as a whole, and, if reasonably necessary, of one firm of local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction (and, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of
interest where the relevant Person affected by such conflict informs the Company of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel (including, if reasonably necessary, its own local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction), of such conflict
counsel for such affected Person and all similarly situated Persons, taken as a whole)), in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with
the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including in connection with any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect thereof. 
(b) The Borrowers agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Arranger, each Syndication Agent, each Documentation Agent, each Issuing
Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee), against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses (including the reasonable and documented fees, disbursements and other charges of one firm of counsel for any Indemnitee, and, if reasonably necessary, of one firm of local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction (and, in the case of
an actual or perceived conflict of interest where the relevant Indemnitee affected by such conflict informs the Company of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel (including, if reasonably necessary, its own local counsel in any
relevant jurisdiction), of such conflict counsel for such affected Indemnitee and all similarly situated Indemnitees, taken as a whole)) incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of
(i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by an Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection
with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
Environmental Liability related in any way to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any
other theory and whether initiated against or by any party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any Affiliate of any of the foregoing or any third party (and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto); provided, that
such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
non-
  83 



appealable judgment to have resulted (A) from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, its Affiliates or their officers, directors or employees or (B) from a
material breach of this Agreement by such Indemnitee. This Section 10.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes, other than Taxes that represent losses, claims or damages arising from any non-Tax claim. 
(c) To the extent that the Borrowers fail to pay any amount required to be paid by them to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent
thereof), any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), such
Issuing Bank, such Swingline Lender or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), such Issuing Bank or such
Swingline Lender in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender in connection with such capacity. 
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) no Borrower shall assert, and each such Borrower hereby waives, any claim against any
Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet), except to
the extent that such damages are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and non-appealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or from a material breach of this Agreement
by such Indemnitee, and (ii) no party hereto shall assert, and each such party hereby waives, any claim against any other party, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or
actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof; provided that nothing
in this sentence shall relieve the Borrowers of any obligation they may have to indemnify an Indemnitee against special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages asserted against such Indemnitee by a third party. 
(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor. 
SECTION 10.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or

  84 



implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby
(including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (e) of this Section), the Arrangers, the Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agents and the Related Parties of
the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
(b) Any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all
or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements at the time owing to it); provided that (i) each of the Company (provided that (A) in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate
of a Lender or to an Approved Fund or (B) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default arising under clause (a), (b), (g) or (h) of Article VII, the consent of the Company shall not be required; and
provided further that the Company shall be deemed to have consented to an assignment unless it shall have objected thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having received a written request
for its consent to such assignment), the Administrative Agent and, in the case of any assignment of a Commitment or any LC Exposure or any Swingline Exposure, as applicable, each Issuing Bank and each Swingline Lender must give their prior written
consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, it being agreed that (x) none of the Company, the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender will be deemed to have acted unreasonably
if it refuses to consent to an assignment to an institution whose unsecured long-term deposit obligations or senior, unsecured, non-credit-enhanced long-term indebtedness for borrowed money shall not have ratings of at least BBB from S&P and
Baa2 from Moodys, in each case with at least stable outlook and (y) the Company will not be deemed to have acted unreasonably if it refuses to consent to an assignment to any Person that is not a Professional Lender), (ii) except in
the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the
assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $10,000,000 unless each of the Company and the
Administrative Agent shall otherwise consent, (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, except that this clause
(iii) shall not apply to rights in respect of outstanding Competitive Loans or Swingline Loans, (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together (except in the
case of an assignment by a Lender to one of its Affiliates or an assignment as a result of any of the events contemplated by Section 2.19) with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender,
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in which the assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level 
  85 



information (which may contain material non-public information about the Borrowers and their Related Parties or their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such
information in accordance with the assignees compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws. Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and
the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning
Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of
this Section.  (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of each Borrower, shall maintain at one of
its offices in The City of New York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and records of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each
Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks shall treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower, any Issuing Bank and any
Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment
and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignees completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in
paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the
Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. 
(e) Any Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Banks, sell participations to one or more
Eligible Assignees (each a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that
(i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other 
  86 



parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly
with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to
any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits
of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. Each Lender selling participations shall keep a register (the
Participant Register) in which it shall record the name and address of each Participant to which such Lender sells participations and the amount and terms of such participations, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of
the Borrowers; provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any
Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in
registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no
responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participations sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participations to such Participant is made with the Companys prior
written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Company is notified of the participations sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees,
for the benefit of the Company, to comply with Section 2.17(f) as though it were a Lender.  (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or
assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank with jurisdiction over such Lender, and
this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledge
or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
  87 


SECTION 10.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by
the Borrowers herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Lender or any
Affiliate of any the foregoing may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any
accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any LC Exposure is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15,
2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of
Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.  SECTION 10.06. USA PATRIOT Act. Each
Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby notifies the Company that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Borrower, which information includes the name and address
of each Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or such Issuing Bank to identify each Borrower in accordance with its requirements. 
SECTION 10.07. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties
hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof, including the commitments of the Lenders and, if applicable, their Affiliates under any
commitment letter entered into in connection with the credit facilities established hereunder and any commitment advices submitted in connection therewith (but do not supersede any other provisions of any such commitment letter or any fee letter
entered into in connection with the credit facilities established hereunder that do not by the terms of such documents terminate upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, all of which provisions shall remain in full force and effect). Except as
provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this
Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 
  88 


SECTION 10.08. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and
the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. 
SECTION 10.09. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and Issuing Bank and each of
its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender, Issuing Bank or Affiliate (a) to or for the credit or the account of the Company against any of and all the obligations of the Company or any Borrower, and (b) to or for the credit or the
account of any Borrower against any of and all the obligations of such Borrower, now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender or Issuing Bank, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or Issuing Bank shall have made any
demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender and Issuing Bank and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
that such Lender, Issuing Bank or Affiliate may have. For purposes of this Section and without limitation, the Guarantee by the Company of the Guaranteed Obligations shall constitute an obligation of the Company. 
SECTION 10.10. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Process Agent; Waiver of Immunity. (a) This Agreement
shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.  (b) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York and of the United States District Court of the
Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined exclusively in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall
affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Issuing Bank may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against any Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. 
(c) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or 
  89 



relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.  (d) Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices to it in Section 10.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. Each
Borrowing Subsidiary that is not organized in the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia hereby irrevocably designates, appoints and empowers the Company as its process agent to receive for and on its behalf service
of process in any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and the Company hereby accepts such appointment. 
SECTION 10.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO
(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. 
SECTION 10.12. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are
not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement. 
SECTION 10.13. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates directors, members, partners, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other
advisers (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory
authority (including (i) any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and (ii) in connection with a pledge or assignment permitted under Section 10.04(g)), (c) to the extent required
by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions at least as restrictive as those of this Section, to (i) any 
  90 



assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective direct or indirect
counterparty (or its advisors) to any securitization, swap or derivatives transaction relating to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and the obligations hereunder, (g) with the consent of the Company or (h) to the extent such Information
(i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than a Borrower. In
addition, each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Commitments. For the purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from the
Borrowers relating to the Borrowers or their business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrowers; provided
that in the case of information received from the Borrowers after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this
Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. 
SECTION 10.14. No Fiduciary Relationship. Each of the Borrowers agrees that in connection with all aspects of the transactions
contemplated hereby and any communications in connection therewith, the Borrowers and their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and their Affiliates, on the other hand, will have a business
relationship that does not create, by implication or otherwise, any fiduciary duty or advisory or agency relationship on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or their Affiliates, and no such duty or relationship will
be deemed to have arisen in connection with any such transactions or communications. The Administrative Agent, each Lender, each Issuing Bank and their respective Affiliates may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Company and the
Borrowing Subsidiaries, their respective equityholders and/or their respective Affiliates.  SECTION 10.15. Conversion of
Currencies. (a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so,
that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which
final judgment is given.  (b) The obligations of each party hereto in respect of any sum due to any other party hereto or any holder of
the obligations owing hereunder (the Applicable  
  91 



Creditor) shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the Judgment Currency) other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder (the
Agreement Currency), be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with
normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement
Currency, the Borrowers agree, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss. The obligations of each party hereto contained in this Section shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.  SECTION 10.16. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the Charges),
shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate) that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of
such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result
of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with
interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.  SECTION 10.17.
Notices under Existing Credit Agreement. Each Lender party hereto, that is also a party to the Existing Credit Agreement, hereby consents and agrees that no prior notice shall be required under the Existing Credit Agreement with respect to
the termination of commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement or prepayment of loans thereunder; provided that notice thereof is given on the Effective Date.

OPINION OF COUNSEL TO COMPANY 
HESS CORPORATION  1185

Timothy B. Goodell  Senior Vice President and 
General Counsel 
[                ], [    ] 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  as Administrative Agent 
270 Park Avenue  New York, NY 10017 
The Lenders, the Swingline Lenders and the Issuing Banks party to the 
Credit Agreement referred to below from time to time 
Ladies and Gentlemen:  I am the general counsel
of Hess Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company), and have acted as such in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Five-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of January 21, 2015 (the Credit
Agreement), among the Company, Hess Oil and Gas Holdings Inc. (HOGH), Hess International Holdings Limited (HIHL), Hess Capital Services LLC (HCS and together with the Company, the DE Opinion
Parties), Hess (Netherlands) Oil and Gas Holdings C.V. (HOGH C.V.), Hess Overseas Finance Investments Centre Limited (HOFIC and together with HOGH, HIHL, HCS and HOGH C.V., the Borrowing Subsidiaries; the
Company and the Borrowing Subsidiaries collectively being referred to as the Borrowers), the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time parties thereto (the Lenders) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
administrative agent (in such capacity, the Administrative Agent).  The opinions expressed below are furnished to you pursuant
to Section 4.01(b) of the Credit Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Credit Agreement and used herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement. 
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have examined the following documents: 
(a) the Credit Agreement and any Notes signed by the Company and the Borrowing Subsidiaries (the Credit Agreement and any such Notes being
hereinafter referred to collectively as the Transaction Documents); and  (b) such corporate documents and records of the
Company and the Borrowing Subsidiaries and such other instruments and certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company, the Borrowing Subsidiaries and other Persons as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the
purpose of this opinion. 


In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have (a) relied as to certain matters of fact
on certificates of the officers of the Company and the Borrowing Subsidiaries, (b) assumed, with your permission, without independent investigation or inquiry, (i) the authenticity of all documents submitted as originals, (ii) the
genuineness of all signatures on all documents that I have examined (other than those of the Company or the Borrowing Subsidiaries and officers of the Company or the Borrowing Subsidiaries) and (iii) the conformity to authentic originals of
documents submitted as certified, conformed or photostatic copies.  When the opinions expressed below are stated to the best of my
knowledge, I have made reasonable and diligent investigation of the subject matters of such opinions and have no reason to believe that there exist any facts or other information that would render such opinions incomplete or incorrect.
 Based upon and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that: 
1. (a) The Company is duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation.     (b) HCS is duly formed and is validly existing as a limited liability company in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its formation.  2. Each DE Opinion Party has the corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged and is duly qualified to transact bu

o have such power and authority and the failure to be so qualified and in good standing does not, in the
aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect.  3. Each DE Opinion Party has the corporate power and authority to make, deliver and
perform its obligations under each Transaction Document to which it is a party and to borrow under the Credit Agreement. Each DE Opinion Party has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the borrowings on the terms and conditions of the
Credit Agreement, including, solely with respect to the Company, the Companys guarantee of the Guaranteed Obligations, and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the
Credit Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party. No consent or authorization of, notice to, filing with or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required in connection with
(i) the borrowings by any Borrower under the Credit Agreement or the guarantee by the Company of the Guaranteed Obligations or (ii) the execution, delivery and performance by any Borrower, or the validity or enforceability against any
Borrower, of each Transaction Document to which it is a party.  4. Each Transaction Document has been duly executed and delivered on
behalf of each Borrower that is a party thereto. Each Transaction Document constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Borrower that is a party thereto, enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with its terms. 
  2 


5. The execution and delivery of each Transaction Document by each Borrower, the performance by
each Borrower of its obligations thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, the compliance by each Borrower with any of the provisions thereof, the borrowings by any Borrower under the Credit Agreement and the use of
proceeds thereof, and the guarantee by the Company of the Guaranteed Obligations, all as provided therein, (a) will not violate (i) in the case of the Company, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws of the Company,
(ii) in the case of HCS, the Certificate of Formation and the Limited Liability Company Agreement of HCS, (iii) any requirement of law or any regulation or order of any Governmental Authority applicable to any Borrower or (iv) any
Contractual Obligation of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of its or their respective assets or properties pursuant to any such requirement of law (or
regulation or order) or Contractual Obligation or (c) require any license, consent or approval of or notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority. 
6. To the best of my knowledge, no litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or
threatened by or against any Borrower or against any of its or their respective properties or revenues (a) with respect to the Credit Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or (b) which would constitute a Material Adverse
Effect.  7. No Borrower is an investment company or a company controlled by an investment company
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. None of the Borrowers is subject to regulation under any Federal or state statute or regulation which limits its ability to incur indebtedness. 
8. The use of proceeds of the Loans, as limited by the provisions of the Credit Agreement, does not violate Regulations U or X of the Board as
in effect from time to time.  The opinions set forth in the second sentence of paragraph 4 above are subject to the effects of bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without
limitation, concepts of materiality and reasonableness and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  I am a member of the bar
of the State of New York and the opinions expressed herein are based upon and are limited to the laws of such state, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware and the Federal
laws of the United States of America. 
  3 


This opinion has been rendered solely for your benefit and for the benefit of your permitted
assignees pursuant to Section 10.04 of the Credit Agreement in connection with the Credit Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby and may not be used, circulated, quoted, relied upon or otherwise
referred to for any other purpose without my prior written consent; provided, however, that this opinion may be delivered to your regulators, accountants, attorneys and other professional advisers and may be used in connection with any
legal or regulatory proceeding relating to the subject matter of this opinion.   




Very truly yours,
