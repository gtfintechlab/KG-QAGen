Agent and make it available to the Collateral Agent at a place and time to be designated by the Collateral Agent that is reasonably convenient to both parties; (ii) occupy any premises owned or, to the extent lawful and permitted, leased by any

of applicable Laws and the notice requirements described below, sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral securing the Secured Obligations at a public or private sale or at any brokers board or on any securities exchange,
for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate; and (vi) with respect to any Intellectual Property Collateral, on demand, cause the Security Interest to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance
of any of or all such Intellectual Property Collateral (provided that no such demand may be made unless an Event of Default has occurred and has continued for thirty (30) days) by the applicable Grantors to the Collateral Agent, or license or

the prospective bidders or purchasers of such securities to Persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the Collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon
consummation of any such sale the Collateral Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold. Each such purchaser at any sale of Collateral shall hold the property sold
absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal which such Grantor now has or may at any time in the future
have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. </font></p>

<p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The Collateral Agent shall give the applicable Grantors ten (10) days prior
written notice (which each Grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Collateral Agents intention to make any sale of Collateral. Such
notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a brokers board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on
which the Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix
and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Collateral Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion)
determine. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given. The Collateral Agent may, without
notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the
same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Collateral Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers
thereof, but the Collateral Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice.
At any public (or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, private) sale made pursuant to this Agreement, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or
appraisal on the part of any Grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by applicable Law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim
then due and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any
Grantor therefor. For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the Collateral Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor
shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Collateral Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the
Secured Obligations paid in full (in which case the applicable Grantors shall be entitled to the proceeds of any such sale pursuant to Section 5.02 hereof). As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the
Collateral Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a
proceeding by a court appointed receiver. Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.01 shall be deemed to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the New York UCC or its equivalent in
other jurisdictions. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Section 5.02. <u>Application of Proceeds</u>. The Collateral Agent shall apply the proceeds of any
collection or sale of Collateral, including any Collateral consisting of cash, in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.04 of the Credit Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any
such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any sale of Collateral by the Collateral Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the Collateral Agent
or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over
to the Collateral Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof. It is understood and agreed that the Grantors shall remain jointly and severally liable to the extent of any deficiency between the amount of the
proceeds of the Collateral and the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations. </font></p>

Code or any comparable provision of state law or the enforceability of the provisions contained in Section 2.03(a) of the Guaranty which purport to limit the obligations of any Guarantor thereunder or the effect of the unenforceability of such
provisions on the enforceability of the Guaranty. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Our opinions are also subject to the qualification that the enforceability of provisions in
the Credit Documents providing for indemnification or contribution, broadly worded waivers, waivers of rights to damages or defenses, waivers of unknown or future claims, and waivers of statutory, regulatory or constitutional rights may be limited
on statutory or public policy grounds. In addition, we express no opinion as to the enforceability of (i) rights of setoff, (ii) rights to receive prepayment premiums or the unaccrued portion of original issue discount upon acceleration,
in each case to the extent determined to be unreasonable or to constitute a penalty or unmatured interest, or (iii) any provision requiring that any action be brought only in the courts of a particular jurisdiction. In connection with the
provisions of the Credit Documents whereby the parties submit to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, we note the limitations of 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1332 on subject matter
jurisdiction of the federal courts. In connection with the provisions of the Credit Documents concerning personal jurisdiction and venue, we note that under NYCPLR § 510 a New York State court has discretion to transfer the place of trial, and
under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) a United States District Court has discretion to transfer an action to another district or division where it might have been brought. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, certain provisions contained in the Credit Documents may be further limited or rendered unenforceable by applicable law, but in our opinion the inclusion of such provisions in the Credit
Documents does not render the Credit Documents invalid as a whole or substantially interfere with the practical realization of the principal benefits intended to be provided thereby. </font></p>
