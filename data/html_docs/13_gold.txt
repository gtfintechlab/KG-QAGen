(e)           Funding by Lenders; Administrative Agent Reliance. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that such Lender will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has timely made such payment and the Administrative Agent may (and in the case of the Borrowing on the Closing Date, shall), in reliance upon such assumption, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such payment available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to immediately repay to the Administrative Agent on demand such corresponding amount, together with interest on such amount, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the applicable Person until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at the lesser of (i) the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) the Maximum Rate.

In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the lesser of (i) the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) the Maximum Rate.

Each Lender will have the right to refuse any prepayment pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(i), 2.04(b)(ii) or 2.04(b)(iii), as applicable, by giving written notice of such refusal to the Administrative Agent within 2 Business Days after such Lenders receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent of such notice of prepayment (such refused amounts, the Declined Proceeds). The Borrower shall make all such prepayments (other than Declined Proceeds) on the Prepayment Date.  The Borrower may retain such Declined Proceeds and apply them in a manner not prohibited by this Agreement.
 
35





 
(v)           Each prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) shall be accompanied by accrued and unpaid interest on the amount prepaid to the date of such prepayment and the amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.10. Each prepayment under this Section 2.04(b) shall be applied to the Advances as determined by the Administrative Agent and agreed to by the Lenders in their sole discretion.
 
Section 2.05          [Reserved].
 
Section 2.06          Repayment of Advances. The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders the outstanding principal amount of each Advance, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on the Maturity Date or such earlier date pursuant to Section 7.02.
 
Section 2.07          Fees.       The Borrower agrees to pay to Jefferies Finance LLC the fees provided for in the Fee Letter.
 
Section 2.08          Interest.  The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance made by each Lender from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:
 
(a)           Reference Rate Advances. Each Reference Rate Advance shall bear interest at the Adjusted Reference Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin for Reference Rate Advances in effect from time to time. The Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the ratable account of each Lender all accrued but unpaid interest on such Lenders Reference Rate Advances in arrears on the date such Reference Rate Advance shall be paid in full.
 
(b)           Eurodollar Rate Advances. Each Eurodollar Rate Advance shall bear interest during its Interest Period equal to at all times the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Rate Advances for such period. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of each Lender all accrued but unpaid interest on each of such Lenders Eurodollar Rate Advances on the last day of the Interest Period therefor and on the date any Eurodollar Rate Advance is repaid.
 
(c)           Default Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 7.01(a) or Section 7.01(e), all overdue Obligations shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at the Default Rate and (ii) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default addressed in the foregoing clause (i)), upon the request of the Majority Lenders, all overdue Obligations shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at the Default Rate. Interest accrued pursuant to this Section 2.08(c) and all interest accrued but unpaid on or after the Maturity Date shall be due and payable on demand (and if no such demand is made, then due and payable on the otherwise due dates provided herein or if no such due dates are provided herein on the last day of each calendar quarter). Interest shall continue to accrue on the Obligations after the filing by or against any Loan Party of any petition seeking any relief in bankruptcy or under any Debtor Relief Law.
 
36





 
Section 2.09          Illegality. If any Lender in its good faith judgment shall notify the Borrower that, after the date hereof, the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Legal Requirement makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to perform its obligations under this Agreement to make, maintain, or fund any Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Lender then outstanding hereunder, (a) the Borrower shall, no later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City, time) (i) if not prohibited by law, on the last day of the Interest Period for each outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advance or (ii) if required by such notice, on the second Business Day following its receipt of such notice, prepay all of the Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Lender then outstanding, together with accrued but unpaid interest on the principal amount prepaid to the date of such prepayment and amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.10 as a result of such prepayment being made on such date, (b) such Lender shall simultaneously make a Reference Rate Advance to the Borrower on such date in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Rate Advances prepaid to such Lender, and (c) the right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances from such Lender for any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until such Lender shall notify the Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. Each Lender agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policies and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Lending Office if the making of such designation would avoid the effect of this paragraph and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
 
Section 2.10          Breakage Costs. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any actual loss, cost or expense incurred by it (other than the Applicable Margin) as a result of:
 
(a)           any continuation, Conversion, payment or prepayment (including any deemed payment or repayment provided for herein) of any Advance other than a Reference Rate Advance on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); provided that, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Lender for any such loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of any prepayment made by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.04(a) or (b) or the repayment made by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.06.
 
(b)           any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make an Advance) to prepay, borrow, continue or Convert any Advance other than a Reference Rate Advance on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
 
(c)           any assignment of an Eurodollar Rate Advance on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.14;
 
including any actual foreign exchange losses and any actual loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Advance, from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of
 
37





 
any foreign exchange contract. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
 
Section 2.11          Increased Costs.
 
(a)           Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:
 
(i)            impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge, or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (or its applicable Lending Office) (except any reserve requirement included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage);
 
(ii)           subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
 
(iii)          impose on any Lender (or its applicable Lending Office) on the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (in each case, other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Advances made by such Lender;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender (or its applicable Lending Office) or such other Recipient of making, Converting to, continuing or maintaining any loan or of maintaining its obligation to make or accept and purchase any such loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its applicable Lending Office) or such other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or such other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b)           Capital/Liquidity Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of financial institutions generally, including such Lenders holding company or any corporation controlling such Lender, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Advances made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender, the corporation controlling such Lender, or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies, the policies of the corporation controlling such Lender, and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time within ten Business Days after written demand by such Lender the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender,
 
38





 
the corporation controlling such Lender, or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c)           Certificate. Any Lender claiming compensation under this Section 2.11 shall furnish to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a statement setting forth the additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 2.11 hereunder which shall be determined by such Lender in good faith and which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof.
 
(d)           Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.11 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
 
Section 2.12          Payments and Computations.
 
(a)           Payments. Subject to Section 2.13, all payments of principal, interest, and other amounts to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement and other Loan Documents shall be made to the Administrative Agent in Dollars and in immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim.
 
(b)           Payment Procedures. The Borrower shall make each payment under this Agreement and under the Notes not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Administrative Agent at the location referred to in the Notes (or such other location as the Administrative Agent shall designate in writing to the Borrower) in same day funds and, as to payments of principal, accompanied by a notice of optional payment from the Borrower, with appropriate insertions and executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the close of business on the day any timely payment is made, cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable solely to the Administrative Agent or a specific Lender pursuant to Sections 2.09, 2.10, 2.11, 2.13, 2.14, and 9.02 and such other provisions herein which expressly provide for payments to a specific Lender, but after taking into account payments effected pursuant to Section 7.04) in accordance with each Lenders applicable pro rata share to the Lenders for the account of their respective applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon receipt of other amounts due solely to the Administrative Agent
 
39





 
or a specific Lender, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such amounts to the appropriate party to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
(c)           Non-Business Day Payments. Whenever any payment shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.
 
(d)           Computations. Computations of interest shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of, (a) with respect to Eurodollar Rate Advances and Reference Rate Advances based on the Federal Funds Rate and the Eurodollar Rate, a year of 360 days and (b) with respect to Reference Rate Advances based on the Reference Rate, a year of 365/366 days, and (c) with respect to of all other interest and fees, on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case, for the actual number of days (including the first day, but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an amount of interest or fees shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
 
(e)           Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Advances or other Obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Advances and accrued but unpaid interest thereon or other such Obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) take an assignment of, or purchase participations in, (in any event, for cash at face value) the Advances and such other Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on their respective Advances and other amounts owing them; provided that:
 
(i)            if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
 
(ii)           the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including any payments in connection with Section 2.04(b)), or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
 
40





 
Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Legal Requirement, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
 
Section 2.13          Taxes.
 
(a)           Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Legal Requirement. If any applicable Legal Requirement (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Legal Requirement and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding of Indemnified Taxes has been made (including such deductions and withholdings of Indemnified Taxes applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
 
(b)           Payment of Other Taxes by Loan Parties. The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Legal Requirement, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
 
(c)           Indemnification by Loan Parties. The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(d)           Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.07 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses
 
41





 
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (d).
 
(e)           Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.13, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(f)            Status of Lenders.
 
(i)            Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Legal Requirement or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.13(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
 
(ii)           Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
 
(A)          any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
 
(B)          any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies
 
42





 
as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or IRS Form W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or IRS Form W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; (ii) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or IRS Form W-8BEN, as applicable); or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or IRS Form W-8BEN, as applicable), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-2 or Exhibit G-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
 
(C)          any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Legal Requirement as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Legal Requirement to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)          if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender
 
43





 
were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Legal Requirement and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Legal Requirement (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
(iii)          On or before the date on which Jefferies Finance LLC (and any successor or replacement Administrative Agent) becomes the Administrative Agent hereunder, it shall deliver to the Borrower two executed copies of either (i) IRS form W-9, or (ii) IRS Form W-8ECI with respect to any payments to be received on its own behalf and IRS Form W-8IMY (certifying that it is either a qualified intermediary within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-1(e)(5) that has assumed primary withholding obligations under the Code, including Chapters 3 and 4 of the Code, or a U.S. branch within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) that is treated as a U.S. person for purposes of withholding obligations under the Code) for the amounts the Administrative Agent receives for the account of others.
 
Each Lender and the Administrative Agent agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(g)           Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.13 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.13), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) 

fied party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less
 
44





 
favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
(h)           Survival.  Each partys obligations under this Section 2.13 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
 
Section 2.14          Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
 
(a)           Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.11, or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.13, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Advances hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.11 or 2.13, as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
(b)           Replacement Lender. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.11 or notifies the Borrower of its inability to make, maintain, or fund any Eurodollar Rate Advances pursuant to Section 2.09, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.13 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.14(a) so as to eliminate such situation, or if any Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 9.07), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.11 or Section 2.13) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:
 
(i)            as to assignments required by the Borrower, the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 9.07, unless such fee has been waived by the Administrative Agent;
 
45





 
(ii)           such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its applicable Advances, accrued but unpaid interest thereon, accrued but unpaid fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.10) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
 
(iii)          in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.11 or such Lenders inability to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Advances pursuant to Section 2.09 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.13, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
 
(iv)          such assignment does not conflict with any applicable Legal Requirement; and
 
(v)           with respect to a Non-Consenting Lender, the proposed amendment, modification, waiver, consent or release with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document has been approved by the Majority Lenders and such agreement, amendment, waiver, consent or release can be effected as a result of such assignment (and, if applicable, one or more other assignments) contemplated by this Section.
 
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Solely for purposes of effecting any assignment involving a Non-Consenting Lender under this Section 2.14 and to the extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, each Lender hereby designates and appoints the Administrative Agent as true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority, for and on behalf of and in the name of such Lender to execute, acknowledge and deliver the Assignment and Acceptance required hereunder if such Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender and such Lender shall be bound thereby as fully and effectively as if such Lender had personally executed, acknowledged and delivered the same.

As of the date hereof, the Borrower has no Subsidiaries other than those identified in Schedule 4.01.
 
Section 4.02          Power; No Conflicts.  The execution and delivery by each Loan Party of the Loan Documents to which each such Person is a party, in accordance with their respective terms and the Advances hereunder do not and will not, by the passage of time, the giving of notice or otherwise, (a) violate any Legal Requirement relating to any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof, (b) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute a default under the articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof, (c) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute a default under the Existing Debt Documents, any other material indenture, agreement, or other instrument to which such Person is a party or by which any of its properties may be bound, or any Governmental Approval relating to such Person, or (d) result in or require the creation or imposition of any

All projections, estimates, and pro forma financial information furnished by any Loan Party were prepared in good faith on the basis of the assumptions believed in good faith to be reasonable at the time made, which assumptions are believed to be reasonable in light of then existing conditions except that such financial projections and statements shall be subject to normal year end closing and audit adjustments (it being recognized by the Lenders that projections are not to be viewed as facts or a guarantee of future performance, are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Loan Parties control and that the actual results during the period or periods covered by such projections may vary from such projections and such variations may be material).

51





 
Authority or arbitrator which could reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change other than as set forth in Schedule 4.07 or which purports to affect the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of this Agreement, any Note, or any other Loan Document. As of the Closing Date, there is no pending or, to the knowledge of any Loan Party, threatened in writing action

roceeding instituted against any Loan Party or any Subsidiary which seeks to adjudicate any Loan Party or any Subsidiary as bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking liquidation, winding up, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief, or composition of it or its debts under any Debtor Relief Law, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the appointment of a receiver, trustee or other similar official for it or for any substantial part of its Property.
 
(b)                                 Each Loan Party and each Subsidiary have complied in all respects with all statutes, rules, regulations, orders and restrictions of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective businesses or the ownership of their respective Property except where such failure to comply could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

No part of the proceeds of the Advances will be used for any purpose which violates, or which would be inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation T, U or X.
 
Section 4.09                             Investment Company Act.

There has been no excise tax imposed under Section 4971 of the Code against any Loan Party that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. Based upon GAAP existing as of the date of this Agreement and current factual circumstances, the Loan Parties have no reason to believe that the annual cost during the term of this Agreement to the Loan Parties for post-retirement benefits to be provided to the current and former employees of any Loan Party under Employee Benefit Plans that are employee welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) could, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change. The Borrower knows of no pending or threatened in writing strikes, work stoppage or other collective labor disputes involving its employees or those of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.

The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent in writing by the Borrower, a Lender or the Collateral Agent. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default, the Administrative Agent shall (subject to Section 9.03) take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall reasonably be directed by the Majority Lenders, provided that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action) with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Lender Parties.

Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of an Advance or any Conversion or continuance of an Advance that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the Collateral Agent unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the Collateral Agent prior to the making of such Advance or Conversion or continuance of an Advance. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

(i)                                     Minimum Amounts. The aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Advances outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Advances of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Acceptance, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $1,000,000, unless (A) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, or an Approved Fund or (B) each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no as no Event of Default under Section 7.01(a) or Section 7.01(e) has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(iii)                               Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by paragraph (b)(i) of this Section and, in addition:
 
(A)                               the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default under Section 7.01(a) or Section 7.01(e) has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (y) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 5 Business Days after having received notice thereof; and

(iv)                              Assignment and Acceptance. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
 
92





 
(v)                                 Limitations on Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or (B) any a Disqualified Lender.
 
(vi)                              No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural Person.
 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10, 2.12, 9.01, and 9.02 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible or have any liability for, or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Disqualified Lender.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not (x) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender or Participant or prospective Lender or Participant is a Disqualified Lender or (y) have any liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or participation of Loans or Commitments, or disclosure of confidential information, to any Disqualified Lender.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any assignment or sale of participations to a Disqualified Lender shall be null and void.
 
(c)                                  Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 9.09 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Advances owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Borrower hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent acting as its agent solely for
 
93





 
the purpose set forth above in this clause (c), shall not subject the Administrative Agent to any fiduciary or other implied duties, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.
 
(d)                                 Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, a Disqualified Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Advances owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 9.02(a) with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s).
 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clauses (a), (b), or (c) of Section 9.03 (that directly and adversely affects such Participant). The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.09, 2.11, and 2.13 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.13(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.13(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.14 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.11 or 2.13, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.14 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 7.04 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.12(e) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Advances or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in
 
94





 
registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations and Section 1.163-5(b) of the United States Proposed Treasury Regulations (or, in each case, any amended or successor version). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. The Borrower hereby agrees that each Lender acting as its agent solely for the purpose set forth above in this clause (d), shall not subject such Lender to any fiduciary or other implied duties, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.
 
(e)                                  Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(f)                                   Cashless Settlement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any Lender may exchange, continue or rollover all or a portion of its Advances in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Lender.
 
Section 9.08                             Confidentiality. Each Lender Party agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and their Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent required or requested by, or required to be disclosed to, any regulatory or similar authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) as to the extent required by Legal Requirements or regulations or in any legal, judicial, administrative or other compulsory proceeding, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies under this Agreement, under any other Loan Document or under any agreement related to any Obligation, or any actio

tion, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to any Loan Party and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (iii) to an investor or prospective investor in an Approved Fund that is instructed of the confidential nature of the information and that such Information may be used solely for the purpose of evaluating an investment or prospective investment in such Approved Fund, (iv) to a trustee, collateral manager, servicer, backup servicer, noteholder or secured party in an Approved Fund
 
95





 
in connection with the administration, servicing and reporting on the assets serving as collateral for an Approved Fund, or (v) to a nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information regarding the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, the Advances and the Loan Documents in connection with ratings issued with respect to an Approved Fund, (g) on a confidential basis to the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers with respect to the credit facility, (h) with the consent of the Borrower, (i) to Gold Sheets and other similar bank trade publications, such information to consist of deal terms and other information customarily found in such publications, (j) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section by the disclosing party or its Related Parties or (ii) becomes available to any Secured Party or affiliate thereof from a third party that is not an Affiliate or Related Party of such Secured Party and that is not, to such Persons actual knowledge, subject to confidentiality obligations to the Borrower, (k) to governmental regulatory authorities in connection with any regulatory examination of any Lender Party or, if such Lender Party deems necessary for the mitigation of claims by those authorities against such Lender Party or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, in accordance with such Lender Partys regulatory compliance policy, (l) to the extent that such information is independently developed by such Lender Party, or (m) for purposes of establishing a due diligence defense. For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from any Loan Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof relating to any Loan Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Collateral Agent on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Loan Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof; provided that, in the case of information received from a Loan Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, nothing in this Agreement shall (a) restrict any Lender Party from providing information to any bank or other regulatory or governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board and its supervisory staff; (b) require or permit any Lender Party to disclose to any Loan Party that any information will be or was provided to the Federal Reserve Board or any of its supervisory staff; or (c) require or permit any Lender Party to inform any Loan Party of a current or upcoming Federal Reserve Board examination or any nonpublic Federal Reserve Board supervisory initiative or action.

(b)                                 Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Article II if such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent that is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it, provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications. Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the senders receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the return receipt requested function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor; provided that, for both clauses (i) and (ii) above, if such notice, email or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice, email or other communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next business day for the recipient.
 
(c)                                  Platform.

(ii)                                  The Platform is provided as is and as available. The Agent Parties (as defined below) do not warrant the adequacy of the Platform and expressly disclaim liability for errors or omissions in the Communications. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by any Agent Party in connection with the Communications or the Platform. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) have any liability to the
 
97





 
Borrower or the other Loan Parties, any Lender or any other Person or entity for damages of any kind, including, without limitation, direct or indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrowers, any Loan Partys or the Administrative Agents transmission of communications through the Platform. Communications means, collectively, any notice, demand, communication, information, document or other material provided by or on behalf of any Loan Party pursuant to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated therein which is distributed to the Administrative Agent or any Lender by means of electronic communications pursuant to this Section, including through the Platform.
 
Section 9.10                             USURY NOT INTENDED. IT IS THE INTENT OF EACH LOAN PARTY AND EACH LENDER PARTY IN THE EXECUTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS TO CONTRACT IN STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE USURY LAWS, INCLUDING CONFLICTS OF LAW CONCEPTS, GOVERNING THE ADVANCES OF EACH LENDER INCLUDING SUCH APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, IF ANY, AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FROM TIME TO TIME IN EFFECT, AND ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WHOSE LAWS MAY BE MANDATORILY APPLICABLE TO SUCH LENDER NOTWITHSTANDING THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN FURTHERANCE THEREOF, THE LENDER PARTIES AND THE LOAN PARTIES STIPULATE AND AGREE THAT NONE OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL EVER BE CONSTRUED TO CREATE A CONTRACT TO PAY, AS CONSIDERATION FOR THE USE, FORBEARANCE OR DETENTION 

ROL OVER ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS WHICH MAY BE IN APPARENT CONFLICT HEREWITH.
 
Section 9.11                             Usury Recapture. In the event the rate of interest chargeable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document at any time is greater than the Maximum Rate, the unpaid principal amount of the Advances shall bear interest at the Maximum Rate until the total amount of interest paid or accrued on the Advances equals the amount of interest which would have been paid or accrued on the Advances if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement or applicable Loan Document had at all times been in effect. In the event, upon payment in full of the Advances, the total amount of interest paid or accrued under the terms of this Agreement and the Advances is less than the total amount of interest which would have been paid or accrued if the rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had, at all times, been in effect, then the Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement, pay the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders an amount equal to the difference between (i) the lesser of (A) the amount of interest which would have been charged on its Advances if the Maximum Rate had, at all times, been in effect and (B) the amount of interest which would have accrued on its Advances if the rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect and (ii) the amount of interest actually paid under this Agreement on its Advances. In the event the Lenders ever receive, collect or apply as interest any sum in excess of the Maximum Rate, such excess amount shall, to the extent permitted by law, be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Advances, and if no such principal is then outstanding, such excess or part thereof remaining shall be paid to the Borrower.
 
Section 9.12                             Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to any Lender Party, or any Lender Party exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any Lender Party in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender Party severally agrees to pay to the Administrative
 
99





 
Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time, in the applicable currency of such recovery or payment. The obligations of the Lenders under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
 
Section 9.13                             Performance of Duties. Each of the Loan Partys obligations under this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents shall be performed by such Loan Party at its sole cost and expense.
 
Section 9.14                             All Powers Coupled with Interest. All powers of attorney and other authorizations granted to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and any Persons designated by the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall be deemed coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable so long as any of the Obligations remain unpaid or unsatisfied, any of the Commitments remain in effect or the credit facility evidenced hereby has not been terminated.
 
Section 9.15                             Governing Law. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any claim, controversy, dispute or cause of action (whether in contract or tort or otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except, as to any other Loan Document, as expressly set forth therein) and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.
 
Section 9.16                             Submission to Jurisdiction; Service of Process. The Borrower and each other Loan Party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not commence any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Secured Party or any Related Party of any Secured Party in any way relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions relating hereto or thereto, in any forum other than the courts of the State of New York sitting in New York County, and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, litigation or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement, in such federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Legal Requirement. Nothing in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document shall affect any right that any Secured Party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against the Borrower or any other Loan Party or its Properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

(a)                                 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed cou

nature page of this Agreement by facsimile or in electronic (i.e., pdf or tif) format shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
 
(b)                                 Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in any Assignment and Acceptance shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Legal Requirement, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
 
Section 9.19                             Independent Effect of Covenants. The Borrower expressly acknowledge and agree that each covenant contained in Articles V or VI hereof shall be given independent effect. Accordingly, no Loan Party shall engage in any transaction or other act otherwise permitted under any covenant contained in Articles V or VI, before or after giving effect to such transaction or act, the Borrower shall or would be in breach of any other covenant contained in Articles V or VI.
 
Section 9.20                             USA Patriot Act. Each Lender that is subject to the Patriot Act and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies each Loan Party that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies such Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of such Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify such Loan Party in accordance with the Patriot Act.
 
Section 9.21                             [Reserved].
 
101





 
Section 9.22                             NON-RELIANCE. IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, EACH LOAN PARTY HEREBY WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS IT IS NOT RELYING ON ANY STATEMENT OR REPRESENTATION OTHER THAN THOSE IN THIS AGREEMENT AND IS RELYING UPON ITS OWN JUDGMENT AND ADVICE OF ITS ATTORNEYS.
 
Section 9.23                             WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENT, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.
 
Section 9.24                             Reversal of Payments. To the extent any Loan Party makes a payment or payments to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent receives any payment or proceeds of the Collateral which payments or proceeds or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any Debtor Relief Law, other applicable Legal Requirement or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds repaid, the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by the Administrative Agent.
 
Section 9.25                             Injunctive Relief. Each Loan Party hereto recognizes that, in the event such Loan Party fails to perform, observe or discharge any of its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement, any remedy of law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Lenders. Therefore, each Loan Party hereto agrees that the Lenders, at the Lenders option, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual damages.
 
Section 9.26                             No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility.

As of the date hereof, after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement, including the making of the Advances under the Credit Agreement on the date hereof, and after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of such Advances:
 
a.              The fair value of the assets of each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, exceeds, on a consolidated basis, their liabilities, contingent or otherwise;
 
b.              The present fair saleable value of the assets of each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability, on a consolidated basis, of their debts as such debts become absolute and matured;
 
c.               Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are able to pay their debts and liabilities, contingent or otherwise, as such liabilities mature in the ordinary course of business; and
