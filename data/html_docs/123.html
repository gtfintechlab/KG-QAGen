Solvency Certificate (<b>Certificate</b>) of Newell Rubbermaid Inc., a Delaware corporation (the <b>Borrower</b>), and its Subsidiaries is delivered pursuant to Section 4.02(d)(vi) of the Term Loan Credit Agreement,

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">1. I have reviewed the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents referred to therein (collectively, the <b>Transaction

of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is greater than the probable liability on existing debts of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, as they become absolute and matured (it being understood that the
amount of contingent liabilities at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in the light of all the facts and circumstances existing as of the date hereof, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured
liability). </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">3. As of the date hereof, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis
are able to pay their debts (including, without limitation, contingent and subordinated liabilities) as they become absolute and mature (it being understood that the amount of contingent liabilities at any time shall be computed as the amount that,
in the light of all the facts and circumstances existing as of the date hereof, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability). </p>

solvent within the meaning given that term and similar terms under applicable laws relating to fraudulent transfers and conveyances. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">5. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, do not intend to, nor do they believe that they will, incur debts that would be
beyond their ability to pay as such debts mature. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">6. As of the date hereof, before and after giving effect to the Transactions, the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries are not engaged in businesses or transactions, nor about to engage in businesses or transactions, for which any property remaining would, on a consolidated basis, constitute unreasonably small capital after giving due
consideration to the prevailing practice in the industry in which they are engaged. </p>
