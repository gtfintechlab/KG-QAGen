The proceeds of the Loan shall bear interest at the Applicable Interest Rate from the Closing Date until repaid in accordance with this Agreement.  Borrower expressly acknowledges and agrees that interest shall accrue on the proceeds of the Loan from the date such proceeds are deemed to be advanced to Borrower as provided in Section 2.2 above.2.7.2    Interest Computation.  Interest shall be applied and calculated on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360)-day year and a thirty (30)-day month.2.7.3    Determination of Applicable Interest Rate.  (a)    The Applicable Interest Rate with respect to the Loan shall be the sum of LIBOR (which shall be the LIBOR rate in effect three (3) LIBOR Business Days prior to the Rate Adjustment Date for each Interest Period) plus the Spread.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Loan is converted to a Prime Rate Loan pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.7.3(b), Section 2.7.3(d) or Section 4.11 below, the Applicable Interest Rate shall be the sum of Prime Rate plus the Prime Rate Spread.  Each determination by Lender of the Applicable Interest Rate shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.(b)    In the event that Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower absent manifest error) that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR, then Lender shall forthwith give notice by telephone of such determination, confirmed in writing, to Borrower at least one (1) New York Banking Day prior to the last day of the related Interest Period.  If Lender gives such notice as provided in this Section 2.7.3(b), the Loan shall be converted from a LIBOR Rate Loan to a Prime Rate Loan on the next succeeding Rate Adjustment Date.(c)    If, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Loan has been converted to a Prime Rate Loan and Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower absent manifest error) that the event(s) or circumstance(s) which resulted in such conversion to a Prime Rate Loan are no longer applicable, Lender shall give notice by telephone of such determination, confirmed in writing, to Borrower at least one (1) New York Banking Day prior to the last day of the related Interest Period.  If Lender gives such notice as provided in this Section 2.7.3(c), the Loan shall be converted from a Prime Rate Loan to a LIBOR Loan on the third (3rd) succeeding Business Day thereafter.(d)    If any Regulatory Change makes it unlawful for Lender to make or maintain a LIBOR Rate Loan as contemplated under this Agreement, (i) the obligation of Lender under this Agreement to make a LIBOR Rate Loan or to convert a Prime Rate Loan to a LIBOR - 30 -14961843v.6Rate Loan shall be canceled forthwith and (ii) the outstanding LIBOR Rate Loan shall be converted automatically to a Prime Rate Loan on the next succeeding Payment Date or within such earlier period as required by law.  Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay Lender, upon demand, any Breakage Costs.  Lender’s notice of such costs, as certified to Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.2.7.4    Default Rate.  In addition to any Late Charge which may be due under this Agreement, the Note, any of the other Loan Documents, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement and any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (including the failure to pay all principal, interest and other sums due on the Maturity Date of the Loan, whether such Maturity Date occurs on the scheduled Maturity Date or by acceleration of the maturity of the Loan or otherwise), Borrower shall pay interest on all sums which are not paid on the date when due at the Default Rate until such sums are paid.  Interest at the Default Rate shall accrue on all sums not paid when due (including the Outstanding Principal Balance, accrued and unpaid interest and all other sums which are due and not paid on the Maturity Date) from the due date of the payment until the full amount of the payment due is paid and credited, regardless of whether an Event of Default has been declared or there has been an acceleration of the maturity of the Loan.  BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT OR IMPRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE ACTUAL DAMAGES OF LENDER RESULTING FROM ANY LATE PAYMENT, AND SUCH DEFAULT RATE INTEREST IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THOSE DAMAGES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PENALTY.2.7.5    Usury Savings Clause.  Borrower represents and warrants to Lender that the Loan is made for business or investment purposes.  All agreements between Lender and Borrower are expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether of advancement of the proceeds hereof or acceleration of the maturity of the remaining Outstanding Principal Balance upon an Event of Default or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of the money advanced or to be advanced hereunder exceed, with respect to any such amount, the amount of interest that would be payable at the Maximum Legal Rate.  If, from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provisions hereof or of any of the other Loan Documents, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement, any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement or any other agreement referred to herein or pertaining hereto, at the time when performance of such provisions shall be due, shall involve transcending the Maximum Legal Rate, which a court of competent jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the Maximum Legal Rate, and if from any circumstances Lender shall ever receive as interest an amount which exceeds the amount of interest that would be payable at the Maximum Legal Rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the remaining Outstanding Principal Balance or other amounts due hereunder (other than interest) without any prepayment premium or charge and not to the payment of interest.  Neither Borrower nor any other Person obligated to pay all or any part of the Indebtedness evidenced by this Agreement or the Note shall have claim or remedy against Lender for any damages whatsoever, or any defenses to enforcement of this Agreement, the Note, the Security Instrument, any of the other Loan Documents or the Environmental Indemnity - 31 -14961843v.6Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement, any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement, relating in any way to allegations that the interest paid or collected hereunder was in excess of the lawful limit, and Borrower, for Borrower and for any and all Persons claiming by, under or through Borrower, hereby waives any such claims, remedies or defenses.  This provision shall control every other provision of this Agreement, the Note, the Security Instrument, any of the other Loan Documents or the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement or any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement.2.7.6    Breakage Costs.  Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that Lender will incur additional costs, expenses and/or liabilities (which may include interest or fees from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by Lender to make the Loan or to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained) as a consequence of (a) any default by Borrower in payment of the principal of or interest on a LIBOR Rate Loan, (b) any Prepayment (whether voluntary or mandatory) of the LIBOR Rate Loan on a day that is not a Payment Date, or (c) the conversion (for any reason whatsoever, whether voluntary or involuntary) of a LIBOR Rate Loan to a Prime Rate Loan on a date other than the Payment Date and that it is extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain the extent of such costs and liabilities.  Therefore, upon the occurrence of any of the events described in the foregoing clauses (a), (b), and (c), Borrower shall pay to Lender, in addition to all interest, principal and other amounts due under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the Outstanding Principal Balance for the remainder of the Interest Period at the Applicable Interest Rate then in effect for such Interest Period, less (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on the Outstanding Principal Balance for the remainder of the Interest Period if the Applicable Interest Rate were set on the date any of the events described in the foregoing clauses (a), (b) or (c) occurred (collectively, “Breakage Costs”).  BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT OR IMPRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE ACTUAL DAMAGES OF LENDER RESULTING FROM ANY PREPAYMENT OF A LIBOR RATE LOAN ON ANY DATE OTHER THAN A PAYMENT DATE, AND SUCH BREAKAGE COSTS ARE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THOSE DAMAGES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PENALTY.2.8    Applicable Taxes.  2.8.1    Payment of Applicable Taxes by Borrower.  All payments made by Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or reduction for or on account of, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, reserves or withholdings imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority after the date hereof (collectively, “Applicable Taxes”); provided, however, the term “Applicable Taxes” shall not include or refer to income and franchise taxes imposed on, levied or assessed against, or collected from Lender by the United States of America or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.  If any Applicable Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable by or on behalf of Borrower to Lender under this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement and any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement, the amounts so payable to Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to Lender (after - 32 -14961843v.6payment of Applicable Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable under this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement and any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement, at the rate or in the amounts specified under this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement and any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement.  Whenever any Applicable Tax is payable pursuant to applicable law by Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter, Borrower shall send to Lender an original official receipt or certified copy thereof, if available, showing payment of such Applicable Tax.  Borrower hereby indemnifies Lender for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by Lender which results from any failure by Borrower to pay any such Applicable Tax when due to the appropriate taxing authority.2.8.2    Lender Withholding Requirements.  Lender shall either (a) file Form W8ECI (or any applicable successor form) with the Internal Revenue Service certifying that Lender is entitled to receive payments under the Note without deduction or withholding of any United States Federal income taxes, or (b) provide such other annual confirmation as may be reasonably satisfactory to Borrower that Lender is entitled to receive payments under the Note without deduction or withholding of any United States Federal income taxes, including any withholding requirements imposed by FATCA if Lender were to fail to comply with applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or Section 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable).  Upon Borrower's written request, Lender will provide Borrower annually with reasonable evidence of Lender's compliance with the requirement of the preceding sentence for the applicable fiscal tax year including such reasonable documentation as may be necessary for Borrower to comply with Borrower’s obligations under FATCA, to confirm that Lender has or has not complied with Lender’s obligations under FATCA and, if necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from any payment under the Note in order for Borrower to comply with FATCA.  Nothing whatsoever contained in this Section 2.8.2 shall under any circumstances excuse Borrower from timely making the payments under the Note when due or provide Borrower or any Guarantor with any defense to, or constitute a waiver of, the timely performance of all obligations, covenants and undertakings of Borrower under any of the Loan Documents, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, the Interest Rate Protection Agreement and the Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Protection Agreement; it being understood and agreed Borrower's and any Guarantor's sole recourse for any failure by Lender to comply with this Section 2.8.2 shall be to withhold and remit to the Internal Revenue Service the amounts of withholding for United States Federal income taxes applicable to Lender.  It shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default if Borrower deducts or withholds from any payment due under this Agreement or any other Loan Document the amount which Borrower is obligated by applicable law to deduct or withhold by reason of Lender's failure to comply with this Section 2.8.2.  The foregoing provisions of this Section 2.8.2 shall apply to any direct transferee of all or any portion of Lender’s interest in the Loan, but shall not apply to a Person who acquires only a participation in Lender’s interest in the Loan and does not have any rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Note or any other Loan Document other than such participant’s rights against Lender in respect of such participation set forth in the participation agreement between Lender and such participant (it being understood Lender shall be responsible for ensuring any payments made to such participant comply with any requirements for withholding of United States Federal income taxes, including any applicable requirements under FATCA).- 33 -14961843v.62.9    Changes in Law.  In the event that any change in any requirement of law or in the interpretation or application thereof, or compliance by Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) hereafter issued from any central bank or other Governmental Authority:  (a) hereafter imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve, special deposit, capital adequacy, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of Lender; or (b) hereafter has the effect of reducing the rate of return on Lender’s capital as a consequence of Lender’s obligations under this Agreement to a level below that which Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration Lender’s policies with respect to capital adequacy); or (c) hereafter imposes on Lender any other condition and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Lender of making, renewing or maintaining loans or extensions of credit or to reduce any amount receivable under this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement and any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement; then, in any such case described above in this Section 2.9, Borrower shall promptly pay to Lender, upon demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable (collectively, “Regulatory Costs”) provided that such obligation to pay Regulatory Costs shall be applied to Borrower on a nondiscriminatory basis along with other borrowers similarly situated to Borrower.  If Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.9, Lender shall provide Borrower with not less than ten (10) days’ notice specifying in reasonable detail the event by reason of which Lender has become so entitled and the additional amount required to fully compensate Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount.  A certificate as to any additional costs or amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by Lender to Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  This provision shall survive payment of the Note and the satisfaction of all other obligations of Borrower under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement and any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement.2.10    Purchase, Sale and Matching Funds.  Borrower understands, agrees and acknowledges the following:  (a) Lender has no obligation to purchase, sell and/or match funds in connection with the use of a LIBOR interest rate as a basis for calculating an Applicable Interest Rate or Breakage Costs; (b) LIBOR is used merely as a reference in determining an Applicable Interest Rate and Breakage Costs; and (c) Borrower has accepted a LIBOR based interest rate as a reasonable and fair basis for calculating an Applicable Interest Rate and Breakage Costs.  Borrower further agrees to pay the Breakage Costs, Applicable Taxes and Regulatory Costs whether or not Lender elects to purchase, sell and/or match funds.2.11    Loan Payments.2.11.1    Payments Generally.  Solely for purposes of the timing for making payments under this Agreement (but not for purposes of calculating Interest Periods, the amount of interest due on amounts payable hereunder or under the Note or the application/allocation thereof to principal and interest), if the day on which such payment is due is not a Business Day, then amounts due on such date shall be due on the immediately succeeding Business Day and with respect to the payment - 34 -14961843v.6of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Loan due on the Maturity Date, interest shall be payable at the Applicable Interest Rate or the Default Rate, as the case may be, through and including the date payment thereof is received by Lender.  All amounts due pursuant to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement and any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall be payable without setoff, counterclaim, defense or any other deduction whatsoever.2.11.2    Monthly Debt Service Payments.  Commencing on February 28, 2013 and continuing on each Payment Date thereafter until and including the Maturity Date, Borrower shall pay to Lender monthly payments of interest only at the Applicable Interest Rate (the “Monthly Debt Service Payments”).  The amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment for the initial Interest Period (i.e. January 31, 2013 through February 27, 2013) shall be Four Hundred Ninety-Two Thousand One Hundred Sixteen and 67/100 Dollars ($492,116.67).  Lender shall determine the Applicable Interest Rate and the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payments for each subsequent Interest Period and notify Borrower in writing thereof within ten (10) Business Days following the Rate Adjustment Date for such subsequent Interest Period; provided, however, Lender’s failure to so notify Borrower shall not relieve Borrower from the obligation to timely make Monthly Debt Service Payments as and when due pursuant to this Agreement.  Lender’s determination of the Applicable Interest Rate for the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payments for subsequent Interest Periods shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower, absent manifest error.  2.11.3    Deduction from Lockbox Account.  In order to ensure timely payment to Lender, Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to directly debit the Lockbox Account on each Payment Date for payment of the Monthly Debt Service Payment which is due on such Payment Date.  The insufficiency of funds on deposit in the Lockbox Account on a Payment Date shall not relieve Borrower from the obligation to make any such Monthly Debt Service Payment as and when due on such Payment Date.2.11.4    Payment in Full on Maturity Date.  On the Maturity Date, Borrower shall pay to Lender the entire Outstanding Principal Balance, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon at the Applicable Interest Rate and any other charges and amounts of money due under this Agreement, the Note, the Security Instrument and any other Loan Document.BORROWER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND UNDERSTANDS THAT THE FOREGOING MONTHLY DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS WILL NOT REPAY ANY PORTION OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN, AND THE ENTIRE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN SHALL BE UNPAID AND DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE MATURITY DATE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF THE AMORTIZATION PROVIDED FOR HEREIN.2.11.5    Application of Payments.  Monthly Debt Service Payments shall be applied first to interest on the Outstanding Principal Balance from time to time outstanding at the Applicable Interest Rate, next to any other charges and amounts of money (other than principal and interest) due to Lender under the Loan Documents or the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement or any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement, and the balance, if any, to be applied in reduction of the Outstanding Principal Balance.  Notwithstanding anything - 35 -14961843v.6to the contrary contained herein, during the continuance of an Event of Default any and all sums of money held or received by Lender may be applied to such items, in such order, at such times and in such manner as Lender deems appropriate.2.12    Prepayment.2.12.1    Prepayment Prohibition.  Except as specifically provided in Section 2.6(f), Section 2.6(g), Section 2.12.2, Section 2.12.5, Section 3.1.4, Section 4.11, Section 4.20.5, Section 4.33, Section 5.2, Section 5.5.1 and Section 5.7.1 of this Agreement, no prepayment of the Loan, in full or in part, shall be allowed.2.12.2    Voluntary Permitted Prepayment.  Borrower may prepay all or any part of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Loan at any time, subject to compliance with and satisfaction of all of the following terms and conditions:(a)    Borrower gives Lender not less than thirty (30) days’ and not more than sixty (60) days’ prior written notice (the “Prepayment Notice”) of Borrower’s election to prepay all or any part of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Loan and specifying the date upon which the Prepayment is to be made; (b)    if the Prepayment does not occur on a Payment Date, Borrower pays to Lender, concurrently with the Prepayment, any Breakage Fees;(c)    any partial Prepayments of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Loan shall be in amounts of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) and in multiples of One Hundred Thousand ($100,000); (d)    if the Prepayment occurs during the first (1st) Loan Year or the second (2nd) Loan Year, Borrower pays to Lender concurrently with the Prepayment, the applicable Prepayment Fee; and (e)    if the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Loan is prepaid in full, Borrower pays to Lender concurrently with such Prepayment any and all accrued and unpaid interest and other sums due under this Agreement, the Note, the Security Instrument, the other Loan Documents, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement and any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement.Borrower may elect to postpone the date designated for the Prepayment by delivering three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice to Lender specifying the new date to which the Prepayment has been postponed; provided, however, if Borrower postpones the date designated for Prepayment more than three (3) times, Borrower shall be deemed to have revoked Borrower’s existing election to make a Prepayment and Borrower may not thereafter make the Prepayment unless Borrower elects again to do so delivering to Lender an entirely new Prepayment Notice specifying a new date designated for the Prepayment which is not less than thirty (30) and no more than sixty (60) days after Lender’s receipt of the new Prepayment Notice.  Borrower also may revoke at any time any pre-payment notice or election.- 36 -14961843v.62.12.3    Prepayment Fee.  The “Prepayment Fee” shall mean (a) if the Prepayment occurs during the first (1st) Loan Year, an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the Prepaid Loan Amount, and (b) if the Prepayment occurs during the second (2nd) Loan Year, an amount equal to one-half of one percent (0.50%) of the Prepaid Loan Amount.  The Prepayment Fee will be due when any amount of the Outstanding Principal Balance is prepaid prior to the expiration of the second (2nd) Loan Year as provided in Section 2.12.2 above or Section 2.12.4 below of this Agreement.2.12.4    Default Prepayment.  If the maturity of the Loan is accelerated prior to the expiration of the second (2nd) Loan Year as a result of an Event of Default, such Event of Default shall be presumed to be, and shall conclusively be deemed to be, an election on the part of Borrower to prepay the Loan and a willful and deliberate attempt on Borrower’s part to avoid payment of the Prepayment Fee.  Accordingly, Borrower expressly acknowledges and agrees that upon an acceleration of the maturity of the Loan prior to the expiration of the second (2nd) Loan Year as a result of an Event of Default (including in connection with reinstatement of the Security Instrument provided by statute during foreclosure proceedings or in connection with any statutory right of redemption or any other prepayment of the Indebtedness, in full or in part, which is not expressly permitted under this Agreement) Lender shall be entitled to the applicable Prepayment Fee.  Borrower hereby expressly (a) waives any rights it may have under California Civil Code Section 2954.10 to prepay the Note, in whole or in part, without penalty, upon acceleration of the maturity date of the Note, and (b) by initialing this provision in the space provided below, hereby declares that Lender's agreement to make the Loan at the interest rate and on the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents constitutes adequate consideration, given individual weight by Borrower, for this waiver and the agreements set forth in this Section 2.12.4.INITIALS:  Borrower:            2.12.5    Mandatory Prepayments.  Without limiting any other provisions of this Agreement, Borrower shall be obligated to prepay the Outstanding Principal Balance as follows:  (a)    on the next occurring Payment Date following the date on which Lender actually receives any Net Proceeds, if Lender is not obligated to make such Net Proceeds available to Borrower for Restoration, Borrower shall prepay, or authorize Lender to apply Net Proceeds as a prepayment of, the Outstanding Principal Balance in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the entire Indebtedness, and (ii) one hundred percent (100%) of such Net Proceeds, which Prepayment shall be without payment of any Prepayment Fee; and(b)    if at any time any Regulatory Change is enacted or adopted which prohibits or makes it unlawful for Lender to maintain ownership of all or any portion of the Loan as an asset of Lender, then Borrower shall prepay in full to Lender the Outstanding Principal Balance and other amounts due under the Loan Documents on the first Payment Date occurring one hundred twenty (120) days after demand therefor by Lender, which Prepayment shall be without payment of any Prepayment Fee; and(c)    as provided in Section 4.11 below, if any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, rule or order makes it unlawful for Borrower to pay or reimburse Lender for any - 37 -14961843v.6Imposition upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement and any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement, which Prepayment shall be without payment of any Prepayment Fee.2.12.6    Partial Prepayments.  Any partial Prepayment shall be applied to the last payments of principal due under the Loan.  No partial Prepayment of the Loan shall cause a recomputation or adjustment of the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment for the Interest Period during which such partial Prepayment of the Loan occurs.  Such reduction in the Outstanding Principal Balance shall only be reflected in the determination of the Monthly Debt Service Payments for subsequent Interests Periods made upon the Rate Adjustment Dates for such subsequent Interest Periods.2.12.7    Release of Property.  Except as set forth in Section 2.12.8 below, no repayment or Prepayment of all or any portion of the Note shall cause, give rise to a right to require, or otherwise result in, the release of the lien of the Security Instrument.2.12.8    Release on Payment in Full.  Lender shall, upon the written request and at the expense of Borrower, upon payment in full of all principal and interest due on the Loan and all other amounts due and payable under the Loan Documents in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Note and this Agreement, instruct the trustee under the Security Instrument to reconvey the liens of the Security Instrument.2.13    Late Charge.  Payments of principal, interest, applicable escrow amounts and other amounts due Lender under the Loan Documents which are not received within ten (10) days after the due date of such payment, other than the payment of the entire Outstanding Principal Balance, accrued and unpaid interest and other sums due on the Maturity Date, shall bear a charge (each, a “Late Charge”) equal to the lesser of (a) five percent (5%) of the delinquent payment or (b) the maximum amount which Lender is permitted to impose by applicable state law or applicable United States federal law (to the extent United States federal law permits Lender to charge a greater amount than state law).  The foregoing Late Charge shall not be imposed upon the final payment of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and other sums due on the Maturity Date; provided, however, in the event the maturity of the Indebtedness occurs or is accelerated prior to the scheduled Maturity Date, then this Section 2.13 and the Late Charge hereunder shall apply to payments which were overdue prior to such acceleration.  BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT OR IMPRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE ACTUAL DAMAGES OF LENDER RESULTING FROM ANY LATE PAYMENT, AND SUCH LATE CHARGE IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THOSE DAMAGES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PENALTY.2.14    Method of Payment; Date of Credit; Billings.  All payments of interest, principal, fees and other amounts due under this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, the Interest Rate Cap Agreement and the Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall be made in lawful money of the United States in Immediate Funds, without counterclaim or setoff and free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding for, any Impositions or other payments, by Lender’s debiting the Lockbox Account as described in Section 2.11.3 above or, to the extent funds are not available in the Lockbox Account, - 38 -14961843v.6by wire transfer to Lender to such bank as Lender may designate in a written notice to Borrower.  Payments shall be credited on the Business Day on which immediately available funds are received prior to Eleven O’clock A.M. Pacific Time; payments received after Eleven O’clock A.M. Pacific Time shall be credited to the Loan on the next Business Day.  If any payment would otherwise be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the payment instead shall be due on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in computing the interest due in respect of said payment.  Lender may submit monthly billings reflecting payments due.  Neither the failure of Lender to submit a billing nor any error in any such billing shall excuse Borrower from the obligation to make full payment of all Borrower’s payment obligations when due.ARTICLE III      CASH MANAGEMENT AND RESERVE FUNDS3.1    Cash Management.3.1.1    Collection Account.  Borrower hereby covenants and agrees as follows with respect to the Collection Account:(a)    Borrower has established with the Depository Bank a segregated, separate and identifiable account in the name of Borrower as account number 4121581805 (the “Collection Account”).  Borrower shall maintain the Collection Account at the Depository Bank (or any successor bank which qualifies as a Depository Bank) for the Loan Term.  The Collection Account shall at all times be an Eligible Account.  Borrower shall be solely responsible for and shall pay when due all servicing and account fees in connection with the Collection Account.  The Collection Account shall, at Borrower’s election, be either (i) interest bearing, or (ii) an account where the earnings on the account balance will be used as a credit to offset the Depository Bank’s customary servicing and account fees for the Collection Account.(b)    Borrower hereby grants to Lender a first priority security interest in the Collection Account and all deposits at any time contained therein and the proceeds thereof and will take all reasonable actions necessary to maintain in favor of Lender a perfected security interest in the Collection Account, including executing and delivering the DACA (or any amendment, restatement or replacement thereof) and executing and filing UCC-1 Financing Statements and continuations thereof.(c)    Borrower, the Depository Bank and Lender have entered into a DACA with respect to the Collection Account.  It shall be an express condition precedent to any relocation of the Collection Account to another Depository Bank that such new Depository Bank and Borrower shall have executed a DACA for the benefit of Lender.  Borrower shall execute such agreements and other documents reasonably requested by Lender or the Depository Bank which are necessary to establish and maintain the Collection Account as provided herein.(d)    Borrower shall cause all Gross Rental Income and all proceeds and other receipts related to or arising from the Security Property to be deposited directly into the Collection Account, including Condemnation awards, Casualty proceeds and Lease Termination - 39 -14961843v.6Payments.  In furtherance of the foregoing, (i) Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Tenants of the Security Property written notices in the form attached as an exhibit to the Cash Management Agreement directing all such Tenants to deposit all Rents (including parking and storage space payments and expense reimbursements) and other items of Gross Rental Income from such Tenants into the Collection Account, (ii) Borrower and Property Manager shall deposit all items of Gross Rental Income received by Borrower or Property Manager into the Collection Account no later than one (1) Business Day immediately following Borrower’s or Property Manager’s receipt thereof, as provided in the Cash Management Agreement, and (iii) upon Lender’s request, Borrower shall execute and deliver to all other Persons who collect Gross Rental Income on behalf of or for the benefit of Borrower (including any parking operators and parking managers at the Security Property) written notice directing such Persons to deposit all items of Gross Rental Income received by such Persons directly into the Collection Account.(e)    Borrower shall cause the Depository Bank to automatically transfer the full amount of all funds in the Collection Account by federal wire transfer of immediately available funds into the Lockbox Account on a daily basis.  Each sweep of the Collection Account shall leave a maximum amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) in the Collection Account (or such other amount reasonably determined by the Depository Bank as necessary to pay any servicing fees or otherwise to maintain the Collection Account).(f)    During the existence of an Event of Default, Lender shall be entitled to direct the Depository Bank to deliver all funds in the Collection Account and all other collateral related thereto to Lender or as Lender may direct, and Lender may apply such funds and other collateral toward payment of the Indebtedness in any order as Lender may elect.3.1.2    Lockbox Account.  Borrower hereby covenants and agrees as follows with respect to the Lockbox Account:(a)    Borrower has established with Lender a non-interest bearing blocked collateral account (without check writing privileges) as Account No. 06001197 (the “Lockbox Account”).  At all times during the Loan Term, Borrower shall maintain the Lockbox Account with Lender and a minimum balance of not less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) shall be on deposit in the Lockbox Account.  During any Lockbox Period, the Lockbox Account shall be under the sole dominion and control of Lender.  The Lockbox Account shall be denominated “Hines REIT One Wilshire LP, as Pledgor/Bank of China, LAB, as Pledgee Lockbox Acct.”  Borrower hereby grants to Lender a first priority security interest in the Lockbox Account and all deposits at any time contained therein and the proceeds thereof and will take all reasonable actions necessary to maintain in favor of Lender a perfected first priority security interest in the Lockbox Account, including filing UCC-1 Financing Statements and continuations thereof.  (b)    Borrower shall cause all payments due to Borrower from the Counterparty pursuant to any Interest Rate Cap Agreement to be deposited directly by the Counterparty into the Lockbox Account.  In furtherance of the foregoing, Borrower shall execute and deliver to each Counterparty written authorizations and instructions irrevocably directing such Counterparty to deposit into the Lockbox Account all payments due from the Counterparty to Borrower pursuant to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement.- 40 -14961843v.6(c)    Until the occurrence of a Lockbox Trigger Event, Borrower shall have full right of access to and the right to withdraw or direct payment of funds from the Lockbox Account and otherwise administer the Lockbox Account, subject to Section 2.11.3 above and the other provisions of this Agreement and the Loan Documents.  From and after the occurrence of a Lockbox Trigger Event and during any Lockbox Period, Borrower shall not have any right to withdraw or direct payment of funds from the Lockbox Account or otherwise administer the Lockbox Account, and all funds in the Lockbox Account shall be disbursed as hereinafter provided in Section 3.1.4 below, until the expiration of the applicable Lockbox Period.(d)    Notwithstanding Section 3.1.2(c) above, Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Lender has the right to debit the Lockbox Account as described in Section 2.11.3 above regardless of whether a Lockbox Trigger Event has occurred and regardless of whether a Lockbox Period is in existence. 3.1.3    Suspension of Threshold DSCR Lockbox Trigger Event.  If the Lockbox Trigger Event which creates the Lockbox Period is a DSCR Trigger Event, then Borrower may thereafter terminate the existence of such DSCR Trigger Event by (a) delivering to Lender an Acceptable Letter of Credit which would be sufficient to reduce the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Loan such that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.25 is met, which Acceptable Letter of Credit shall be additional security for payment or performance of the Obligations, or (b) making a partial Prepayment to Lender of the principal of the Loan sufficient to reduce the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Loan such that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.25 is met.

If any certificate of insurance for any blanket insurance policy does not evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of Lender that all of the insurance coverage required hereunder is being provided by such blanket insurance policy, then Lender shall have the right to require Borrower to deliver to Lender, within five (5) Business Days following Lender’s written request, (i) certified copies of all of the declaration pages and endorsement to such blanket insurance policy, (ii) all forms and conditions of such blanket insurance policy relative only to the Security Property, and (iii) a schedule setting forth the aggregate loss limit under such blanket insurance policy and the value allocated to the Real Property under such blanket insurance policy.

All insurance policies required under this Security Instrument shall be with a company or companies which are acceptable to Lender and are fully authorized, licensed and admitted to do business in the state in which the Security Property is located with a claims paying ability or financial strength rating of A-:X or higher (unless otherwise reasonably approved by Lender; provided, however, in all events the claims paying or financial strength rating must be not less than A-), according to the standards set by A.M.

Borrower acknowledges that Lender has examined and relied on the creditworthiness and experience of Borrower in owning and operating properties such as the Security Property in agreeing to make the Loan, and that Lender will continue to rely on Borrower’s ownership of the Security Property as a means of maintaining the value of the Security Property as security for repayment of the Indebtedness, except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 4.20.2 above or Section 4.20.5 below.  Borrower acknowledges that Lender has a valid interest in maintaining the value of the Security Property so as to ensure that, should Borrower - 62 -14961843v.6default in the repayment of the Indebtedness, Lender can recover the Indebtedness by a sale of the Security Property.4.20.4    No Impairment Required.  Lender shall not be required to demonstrate any actual impairment of Lender’ security or any increased risk of Default hereunder in order to declare the Indebtedness immediately due and payable upon any Transfer in violation of this Section 4.20 without Lender’s consent.  This provision shall apply to every Transfer in violation of this Section 4.20 regardless of whether voluntary or not, or whether or not Lender has consented to any previous Transfer.

Borrower agrees to bear and shall pay or reimburse Lender on demand for all Lender Expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, title search costs and title insurance endorsement premiums) incurred by Lender in connection with the review, approval and documentation of any such Transfer.4.20.5    Permitted Property Transfer.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.20.1 above, Lender agrees not to unreasonably withhold Lender’s consent to a one-time sale, transfer, or assignment by the original Borrower hereunder as of Loan Closing (which includes Borrower after taking into account any Permitted Interest Transfers which may occur as provided in Section 4.20.2 hereof) of all of Borrower’s interest in the Real Property or all of the interests in Borrower not otherwise permitted under Section 4.20.2 (a “Permitted Property Transfer”) to a transferee (a “Transferee Borrower”), without the payment of any assumption or other fee and with any change in the terms of the Loan Documents (other than such modifications to the Loan Documents as Lender reasonably deems necessary or appropriate to reflect the Transferee Borrower, the Substitute Guarantor and the Permitted Property Transfer), so long as:  (a) at least thirty (30) days prior to the closing of the proposed Permitted Property Transfer, Borrower delivers written notice thereof to Lender (the “Transfer Notice”) and provides Lender with (i) the name, net worth, background and address of the proposed Transferee Borrower (and its parent or Affiliate, if the Transferee Borrower will be a single asset entity) and such other information regarding the proposed Transferee Borrower (and its parent or Affiliate, if the Transferee Borrower will be a single asset entity) as Lender would reasonably require in evaluating an initial extension of credit to a borrower, and (ii) with all of the material provisions of the proposed Permitted Property Transfer, including the proposed closing date of the Permitted Property Transfer and the purchase price; (b) the proposed Transferee Borrower is a Special Purpose Bankruptcy Remote Entity which is owned and controlled, directly or indirectly, by a Qualified Real Estate Investor which directly or through Affiliates owns a minimum of three million (3,000,000) rentable square feet of general office space and currently owns (or has owned in the past) a minimum of five hundred thousand (500,000) rentable square feet of commercial data center space in real estate projects which are of a similar nature and comparable quality as the Real Property, provided, however, if the proposed Transferee Borrower (or its Qualified Real Estate Investor owner and Affiliates) does not satisfy both of the foregoing requirements for ownership of three million (3,000,000) rentable square feet of general office space and five hundred thousand (500,000) rentable square feet of commercial data center space, it shall be sufficient for purposes of this Section 4.20.5 if the Property Manager for such proposed Transferee Borrower has ten (10) years experience managing the requisite amount of general office space or the requisite amount of commercial data center space, whichever is lacking with respect to the proposed Transferee Borrower (or its Qualified Real Estate Investor owner and Affiliates); (c) a - 63 -14961843v.6property inspection by or on behalf of Lender no earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the closing of the Permitted Property Transfer shows that the Real Property is in good condition and repair as required by the Loan Documents; (d) as of the date which is no earlier than thirty (30) days prior to the closing of the Permitted Property Transfer, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio is not less than 1.5 (taking into account any increase in Real Estate Taxes resulting from the proposed Permitted Property Transfer) and Borrower provides a Compliance Certificate (and such supporting documentation as Lender reasonably requests) to evidence the same; (e) the Loan-to-Value Percentage, based upon a Real Property Appraisal performed at Borrower’s expense no earlier than ninety (90) days prior to the Permitted Property Transfer is not greater than sixty percent (60%) (and Borrower may make a partial Prepayment to Lender of the principal of the Loan sufficient to reduce the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Loan such that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.5 is met, and any such partial Prepayment of the Outstanding Principal Balance shall not require the payment of any Prepayment Fee but shall include any Breakage Costs); (f) Borrower pays for all Lender’s Expenses associated with the Permitted Property Transfer, including reasonable attorney’s fees charged by Lender’s counsel, whether or not for any reason the proposed Permitted Property Transfer does not in fact occur; (g) pursuant to an assumption agreement reasonably satisfactory to Lender, the proposed Transferee Borrower expressly assumes all of the obligations and liabilities of Borrower under the Loan Documents (with the same degree of recourse liability as Borrower and subject to the same exculpatory provisions) that accrue after the closing of the Permitted Property Transfer and the proposed Transferee Borrower makes the same representations and warranties with respect to the Loan as Borrower and the Constituent Borrower Owners made at Loan Closing (and upon such assumption by the Transferee Borrower, Borrower shall be released from liability under the Loan Documents accruing after the closing of the Permitted Property Transfer); (h) another Person that is a Qualified Real Estate Investor (a “Substitute Guarantor”) executes and delivers a replacement guaranty in the form of, and upon the same terms contained in, the Guaranty for liability accruing after the closing of the Permitted Property Transfer and a replacement environmental indemnity agreement in the same for of, and upon the same terms contained in, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement for liability accruing after the closing of the Permitted Property Transfer (and upon such execution and delivery of the replacement Guaranty and replacement Environmental Indemnity Agreement, Guarantor shall be released from liability under the Guaranty and the Environmental Indemnity Agreement accruing from and after the closing of the Permitted Property Transfer); (i) the Permitted Property Transfer is not construed so as to relieve Borrower of Borrower’s liability for Recourse Obligations or under the Environmental Indemnity Agreement accruing prior to the Permitted Property Transfer, or to relieve Guarantor of the liability of Guarantor under the Guaranty or the Environmental Indemnity Agreement accruing prior to the closing of the Permitted Property Transfer, and Borrower and Guarantor execute ratification agreements reasonably required by Lender to evidence and effectuate the ratification of such liability for the Recourse Obligations and the Guaranty and the Environmental Indemnity Agreement accruing prior to the closing of the Permitted Property Transfer (and upon satisfaction of the requirement in Section 4.20.5(g) and Section 4.20.5(h) above, Borrower and Guarantor shall be released from their respective liability for Recourse Obligations and under the Guaranty and the Environmental Indemnity Agreement arising after the closing of the Permitted Property Transfer); (j) the proposed Transferee Borrower and the Substitute Guarantor furnish all reasonably appropriate documents evidencing the capacity and good standing of proposed Transferee Borrower and the proposed Substitute Guarantor as indemnitor and guarantor, and the qualification of the signers to - 64 -14961843v.6execute the assumption of the indebtedness and the obligations of the Loan Documents or the replacement Guaranty and the replacement Environmental Indemnity Agreement, as the case may be, which documents shall include certified copies of all documents relating to the organization and formation of the proposed Transferee Borrower and the proposed Substitute Guarantor as indemnitor and guarantor and of the entities, if any, which are shareholders, partners or members of or in the proposed Transferee Borrower and the proposed Substitute Guarantor as indemnitor and guarantor; (k) Lender receives, without any cost or expense to Lender, an endorsement or endorsements to the Loan Title Policy extending the effective date of the Loan Title Policy to the date of execution and delivery (or, if later, of recording) of the assumption agreement referred to in Section 4.20.5(g) above, (i) with (A) no additional exceptions added to such Loan Title Policy whatsoever which have priority over the Security Instrument, and (B) no additional exceptions added to such Loan Title Policy which are subordinate to the Security Instrument except those as are permitted by this Agreement or otherwise reasonably acceptable to Lender, and (ii) insuring that fee simple title to the Real Property is vested in the Transferee Borrower; provided, however, if such Permitted Borrower Transfer is a transfer of direct or indirect ownership interest(s) in Borrower rather than a conveyance of the Real Property, then such endorsement(s) need not extend the effective date of the Loan Title Policy but shall affirmatively insure Lender that such Transfer of direct or indirect ownership interest(s) in Borrower does not affect the validity or priority of the Security Instrument; (l) Borrower and Guarantor execute and deliver to Lender, without any cost or expense to Lender, a release of Lender and Lender Parties from all claims and liability relating to the transactions evidenced by the Loan Documents through and including the date of the closing of the Permitted Property Transfer, which agreement shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender and shall be binding upon the Transferee Borrower and the Substitute Guarantor; (m) at the time the Transfer Notice is delivered to Lender and at the time the Permitted Property Transfer occurs, Event of Default under the Loan Documents, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement or any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement exists and is continuing; (n) the proposed Transferee Borrower and proposed Substitute Guarantor are organized and domiciled in the United States; and (o) Lender receives an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Lender that contains equivalent opinions (based on equivalent assumptions and qualifications) to the extent applicable with respect to the proposed Transferee Borrower and the Substitute Guarantor above that were given with respect to Borrower and Guarantor at Loan Closing, including that (i) the proposed Transferee Borrower and the proposed Substitute Guarantor are duly formed and validly in existence with applicable laws, (ii) the proposed Transferee Borrower and the proposed Substitute Guarantor have duly authorized, executed and delivered the agreements by which the proposed Transferee Borrower and the Substitute Guarantor as indemnitor and guarantor assume all of the obligations and liabilities under the Loan Documents and with respect to the Loan as provided above, and (iii) such assumption agreements are valid and enforceable against the proposed Transferee Borrower, the Substitute Guarantor and the Security Property.4.21    Restriction on Further Encumbrances and Debt.

For the avoidance of doubt, except as provided in Section 4.20.2 above, no “mezzanine financing” secured by pledges of the partnership interests in Borrower or the ownership interest(s) in the partners of Borrower shall be permitted.4.22    Notice of Claims and Litigation.  Borrower shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) days after Borrower’s own receipt of notice) notify Lender in writing of any pending or threatened Claims which are received in writing by Borrower, any other Borrower Party or Property Manager, including any suits or proceedings at law or in equity or before or by any Governmental Authority, which (a) if adversely determined would materially affect the financial condition of Borrower or the Security Property or (b) involve the validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents or the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement or any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement, or the priority of any of the liens and security interests of the Security Instrument or any other Loan Document against the Security Property.

Borrower shall have the right to direct Lender to invest any such Casualty insurance proceeds or Condemnation awards held by Lender (or by any Loan Servicer for the benefit of Lender) in Permitted Investments in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement with respect to the Reserve Funds.  All such sums are hereby assigned to Lender for the benefit of Lender, and Borrower shall, upon request of Lender, make, execute, acknowledge, and deliver any and all additional assignments, instruments, certificates and documents as may be necessary from time to time to enable Lender to collect any such sums.

As used herein, “Net Insurance Proceeds” means the net amount of all insurance proceeds with respect to any insured Casualty which are paid to or for the benefit of Borrower or which are received by Lender or by any Loan Servicer for Lender’s benefit, after deducting the out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Lender in collecting the same.

Lender’s acceptance of payment of any sum secured by any of the Loan Documents and any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement after the due date of such payment shall not be a waiver of Lender’s rights to either require prompt payment when due of all other sums so secured or to declare a default for failure to make prompt payment.  The procurement of insurance or the payment of Impositions or other Liens or charges by Lender shall not be a waiver of Lender’s rights to accelerate the maturity of the Loan, nor shall Lender’s receipt of any awards, proceeds or damages under the Security Instrument operate to cure or waive Borrower’s default in payment of sums secured by any of the Loan Documents.  With respect to all Loan Documents, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement or any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement, only waivers specifically and expressly made in writing by Lender shall be effective against Lender.  References in this Agreement, any other Loan Document, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement and any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement to the “continuance of an Event of Default”, the “existence of an Event of Default” or words of similar import shall not be deemed or construed to mean that Lender is agreeing to excuse or to extend the time by which Borrower may cure such Event of Default or to delay or waive Lender’s right to exercise any rights or remedies to which Lender may be entitled by reason of such Event of Default.6.2.10    Lender’s Right to Perform.  If Borrower fails to perform any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, and such failure constitutes an Event of Default hereunder, then without in any way limiting Lender’s right to exercise any of Lender’s rights, powers or remedies as provided hereunder, or under any of the other Loan Documents, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, any Interest Rate Cap Agreement or any Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap - 92 -14961843v.6Agreement, Lender may, but shall have no obligation to, perform, or cause performance of, such covenant or obligation, and all costs, expenses, liabilities, penalties and fines of Lender incurred or paid in connection therewith shall be payable by Borrower to Lender within ten (10) days after the date Lender makes written demand therefor and, if not paid, shall be added to the Indebtedness secured by the Security Instrument and other Loan Documents and shall bear interest thereafter at the Default Rate.ARTICLE VII      LIMITATION ON LIABILITY7.1    No Personal Liability.

In the event that any liability of Lender or any Lender Successor does arise pursuant to this Agreement or the Lease, such liability shall be limited and restricted to Lender’s or the Lender’s Successor’s interest in the Real Property and shall in no event exceed such interest in the Real Property.6.    This Agreement shall be binding on and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and assigns.  As used herein the word “Tenant” shall include Tenant, its successors and assigns; and the word “Lender” shall include the Lender specifically named herein and any of its successors, participants and assigns, including anyone who shall have succeeded to Landlord’s interest in the Real Property by, through or under Foreclosure of the Mortgage.7.    In the event Landlord defaults in the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions or agreements in the Lease, Tenant shall give written notice thereof to Lender and Lender shall have the right (but not the obligation) to cure such default.  Tenant shall not take any action with respect to such default under the Lease, including, without limitation, any action in order to terminate, rescind or void the Lease or to withhold any rental thereunder, for a period of ten (10) days after receipt by Lender of such written notice with respect to any such default capable of being cured by the payment of money and for a period of thirty (30) days after receipt by Lender of such written notice with respect to any other such default or such longer period as may be necessary in the case of any default which cannot be cured by the payment of money within such thirty (30)-day period because of the nature of such default.
