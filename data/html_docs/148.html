may be. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) (i) <u>Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent</u>. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 9:00 a.m. on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with <u>Section</u><u></u><u> 2.02</u> (or, in the case of a
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by <u>Section</u><u></u><u> 2.02</u>) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower
a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, <u>plus</u> any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in
the case of a payment to be made by any Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the applicable Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the applicable Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the applicable Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount
so paid shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the applicable Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the applicable Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment
to the Administrative Agent. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(ii) <u>Payments by Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent</u>. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the applicable Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in
fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date
such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. </p>

will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Borrower enforceable against such in accordance with the terms thereof to the same extent as if a manually executed original signature was delivered. Any Communication may be
executed in as many counterparts as necessary or convenient, including both paper and electronic counterparts, but all such counterparts are one and the same Communication. For the avoidance of doubt, the authorization under this paragraph may
include, without limitation, use or acceptance by the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders of a manually signed paper Communication which has been converted into electronic form (such as scanned into PDF format), or an electronically signed
Communication converted into another format, for transmission, delivery and/or retention. The Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders may, at its option, create one or more copies of any Communication in the form of an imaged Electronic Record

Electronic Copy, shall be considered an original for all purposes, and shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent is under no
obligation to accept an Electronic Signature in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided, further, without limiting the foregoing, (a) to the extent the
Administrative Agent has agreed to accept such Electronic Signature, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on any such Electronic Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of a Borrower without further
verification and (b) upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart. For purposes hereof, <u>Electronic Record</u> and
<u>Electronic Signature</u> shall have the meanings assigned to them, respectively, by 15 USC §7006, as it may be amended from time to time. </p>
