r in the London interbank market.  In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the “IBA”) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate.  As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on Eurodollar Loans.  In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate.  Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-In Election, Section 2.11(b) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest.  The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of “LIBO Rate” or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including (a) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to Section 2.11(b), whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, and (b) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to Section 2.11(b)), including whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBO Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability.SECTION 1.06.  Divisions.  For a

h option shall not affect the obligation of the Company to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.(c)  At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of US$1,000,000 and not less than US$5,000,000; provided that (i) a Eurocurrency Borrowing that results from a continuation of an outstanding Eurocurrency Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to such outstanding Borrowing and (ii) an ABR Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the Commitments.  At the time that each ABR Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of US$1,000,000 and not less than US$5,000,000.  Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of five (or such greater number as may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent) Eurocurrency Borrowings outstanding.(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert to or continue, any Eurocurrency Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date.SECTION 2.03.

To request a Borrowing, the Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone or in writing (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of the proposed Borrowing.  Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be made (or, if telephonic, confirmed promptly) by hand delivery, facsimile or email 33to the Administrative Agent of an executed written Borrowing Request.  Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:(i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;(ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;(iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing;(iv) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”; and(v) the location and number of the account or accounts to which funds are to be disbursed.If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing.  If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency Borrowing, then the Company shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.  Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.SECTION 2.04.  Funding of Borrowings.  (a)  Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 2:00 p.m., New York City time (or, in the case of ABR Loans, such later time as shall be three hours after the delivery by the Company of a Borrowing Request therefor in accordance with Section 2.03), in each case, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders.  The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Company by promptly remitting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Company.(b)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance on such assumption, make available to the Company a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Company severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Company to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by 34such Lender, the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Company, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.  If the Company and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Company the amount of such interest paid by the Company for such period.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by the Company shall be without prejudice to any claim the Company may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.SECTION 2.05.  Interest Elections.  (a)  Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in the applicable Borrowing Request or as otherwise provided in Section 2.03.

The Company may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. (b)  To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone or in writing by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Company were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.  Each such telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be made (or, if telephonic, confirmed promptly) by hand delivery or facsimile to the Administrative Agent of an executed written Interest Election Request.  Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and35(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is to be a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Company shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.(c)  Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.(d)  If the Company fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing for an additional Interest Period of one month.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default under clause (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Company, or if any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, has notified the Company of the election to give effect to this sentence on account of such other Event of Default, then, in each such case, so long as such Event of Default is continuing, (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.SECTION 2.06.

In such event, the Company shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender and its registered assigns and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent.

(a) If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing:(i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period (including because the Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis), provided that no Benchmark Transition Event shall have occurred at such time; or(ii) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that because of a change in circumstances affecting the Eurocurrency market generally the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making, continuing, converting or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;then the Administrative Agent shall give notice (which may be telephonic) thereof to the Company and the Lenders as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (A) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective and such Borrowing shall continue as an ABR Borrowing and (B) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.(b) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Company may amend this Agreement to replace the LIBO Rate with a Benchmark Replacement.  Any such amendment 39with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Company, so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such proposed amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders; provided that, with respect to any proposed amendment containing any SOFR-Based Rate, the Lenders shall be entitled to object only to the Benchmark Replacement Adjustment contained therein.  Any such amendment with respect to an Early Opt-in Election will become effective on the date that Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Lenders consent to such amendment.  No replacement of the LIBO Rate with a Benchmark Replacement will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.(ii) In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Company, will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.(iii) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of (A) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date and Benchmark Transition Start Date, (B) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (C) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes and (D) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period.(iv) Upon the Company’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, (A) any request pursuant to Section 2.05 for a conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, and, on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, such Borrowing shall be continued as an ABR Borrowing, and (B) any request pursuant to Section 2.03 for a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be deemed to be a request for an ABR Borrowing.(v) Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.11, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.11.SECTION 2.12.  Increased Costs; Illegality.  (a)  If any Change in Law shall:40(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); (ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreemen

ny of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or expenses or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs, expenses or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.(e)  If any Lender determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or the applicable lending office of such Lender to make, maintain or fund any Eurocurrency Loan or to charge interest with respect to any Loan, or to determine or charge interest rates, based upon the LIBO Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, US Dollars in the London interbank market, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Company and the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make, maintain or fund any Eurocurrency Loan, or to continue any Eurocurrency Loan or convert any ABR Loan into a Eurocurrency Loan, or to charge interest with respect to any Loan, or to determine or charge interest rates, based upon the LIBO Rate, in each case, shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, the interest rate on the ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Company shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurocurrency Loans of such Lender to ABR Loans (the interest rate on the ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Loans and (B) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Alternate Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based 42upon the LIBO Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Company shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.SECTION 2.13.  Break Funding Payments.  In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert or continue any Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (whether or not such notice may be revoked in accordance with the terms hereof), (d) the failure to prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on a date specified therefor in any notice of prepayment given by the Company (whether or not such notice may be revoked in 

aw.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Company shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable 43Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.(b)  Payment of Other Taxes by the Company.  The Company shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse the Administrative Agent for the payment of, any Other Taxes. (c)  Evidence of Payment.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Company to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.(d)  Indemnification by the Company.  The Company shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(e)  Indemnification by the Lenders.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Company has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(c)(ii) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).(f)  Status of Lenders.  44(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company and the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.14(f)(ii)(A), 2.14(f)(ii)(B) or 2.14(f)(ii)(D)) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or about the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;(2) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a 45certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of

r a “controlled foreign corporation” related to the Company as described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W 8BEN-E; or(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W 8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Taxes imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or 46certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.  (g)  Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that 

 deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This paragraph (g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.(h)  For purposes of this Section, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.SECTION 2.15.  Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs.  (a)  The Company shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document prior to the time required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without any defense, setoff, recoupment or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to such account as may be specified by the Administrative Agent, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payment received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in US Dollars.47(b)  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied towards payment of the amounts then due hereunder ratably among the parties entitled thereto, in accordance with the amounts then due to such parties.(c)  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the amount of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amounts of principal of and accrued interest on their Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, as in effect from time to time), including Section 2.19, or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any Person that is an Eligible Assignee (as such term is defined herein from time to time).  The Company consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Company rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Company in the amount of such participation.(d)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders that the Company will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Company has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if the Company has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.(e)  If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it hereunder to or for the account of the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy 48such Lender’s obligations in respect of such payment until all such unsatisfied obligations have been discharged.(f)  In the event that any financial statements delivered under Section 5.01(a) or 5.01(b), or any Compliance Certificate delivered under Section 5.01(c), shall prove to have been materially inaccurate, and such inaccuracy shall have resulted in the payment of any interest or fees at rates lower than those that were in fact applicable for any period (based on the actual Leverage Ratio), then, if such inaccuracy is discovered prior to the termination of all Commitments and the repayment in full of the principal of all Loans, the Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for distribution to the Lenders as their interests may appear, the accrued interest or fees that should have been paid but were not paid as a result of such inaccuracy.SECTION 2.16.  Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  (a)  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12 (or gives a notice under Section 2.12(e)), or if the Company is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or to any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Company) use commercially reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment and delegation (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.14, as the case may be, in the fut

nder in connection with any such designation or assignment and delegation within 10 days following request of such Lender (accompanied by reasonable (to the extent practicable) back-up documentation relating thereto).(b)  If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12 (or gives a notice under Section 2.12(e)), (ii) the Company is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, (iii) any Lender has become a Defaulting Lender, (iv) any Lender is a Disqualified Institution, (v) any Lender is a Non-Extending Lender or (vi) any Lender has failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver or other modification that under Section 9.02 requires the consent of all the Lenders (or all the affected Lenders) and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have granted their consent, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04, it being understood that the processing and recordation fee referred to in such Section shall be paid by the Company or the assignee (and the assignor Lender shall not be responsible therefor)), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.14) and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an Eligible 49Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment and delegation) (a “Replacement Lender”); provided that (A) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from the assignee (in the case of such principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts), (C) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments, (D) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law and (E) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from the failure to provide a consent, the assignee shall have given such consent and, as a result of such assignment and delegation and any contemporaneous assignments and delegations and consents, the applicable amendment, waiver, discharge or termination can be effected.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver or consent by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation have ceased to apply.  Each party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this paragraph (b) may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto.SECTION 2.17.  Defaulting Lenders.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:(a)  the Commitment and the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders or any other requisite Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); provided that any amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or all Lenders affected thereby shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02, require the consent of such Defaulting Lender in accordance with the terms hereof; (b)  any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.15(c) shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Company may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as 50determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Company, to be held in a deposit account and released in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Company as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Company against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments.  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and such Defaulting Lender irrevocably consents hereto; and(c)  commitment fees shall cease to accrue on the unused Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.09(a).In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Company each agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, and such Lender shall thereupon cease to be a Defaulting Lender (but all amendments, waivers or modifications effected without its consent in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.02 and this Section during such period shall be binding on such Lender and no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Company while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender).The rights and remedies against, and with respect to, a Defaulting Lender under this Section are in addition to, and cumulative and not in limitation of, all other rights and remedies that the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Company may at any time have against, or with respect to, such Defaulting Lender.SECTION 2.18.  Extension of Maturity Date.  (a)  The Company may, by written notice (an “Extension Notice”) delivered to the Administrative Agent not fewer than 5130 days and not more than 60 days prior to any anniversary of the Closing Date, request an extension (each, an “Extension”) of the Maturity Date to the one-year anniversary of the then existing Maturity Date (such existing Maturity Date, the “Existing Maturity Date”), provided that not more than two Extensions may be requested since the Closing Date and, after giving effect to any Extension, the Maturity Date may not be more than five years after the applicable Extension Closing Date.(b)  The Administrative Agent shall promptly furnish a copy of each Extension Notice to each Lender, and shall request that each Lender advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to the requested Extension within 15 days of delivery to such Lender of such Extension Notice; provided that any Lender that does not advise the Administrative Agent by the 15th day after the date of such Extension Notice shall be deemed to have declined the requested Extension (each Lender agreeing to the requested Extension being called an “Extending Lender”, and each Lender declining or deemed to have declined to agree to the requested Extension being called a “Non-Extending Lender”). The decision to agree or withhold agreement to any Extension hereunder shall be at the sole discretion of each Lender.  If Lenders (including any Replacement Lenders) constituting not less than the Required Lenders shall have agreed to extend the Maturity Date before the anniversary of the Closing Date immediately following the delivery of the applicable Extension Notice, then, effective as of the Extension Closing Date with respect thereto, the Maturity Date applicable to the Extending Lenders shall be the first anniversary of the Existing Maturity Date; provided that no extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 2.18 shall become effective unless (the first date on which such consent of the Required Lenders is obtained and the conditions specified in this proviso are satisfied with respect to the applicable Extension being called the “Extension Closing Date”) (i) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct (x) in the case of the representations and warranties qualified as to materiality, in all respects and (y) otherwise, in all material respects, in each case on and as of the Extension Closing Date, except in the case of any such representation and warranty that expressly relates to a prior date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be so true and correct on and as of such prior date, (ii) on the Extension Closing Date, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing immediately prior to or immediately after giving effect thereto and (iii) the Administrative Agent shall have received a  certificate dated as of the Extension Closing Date and executed by a Responsible Officer of the Company to the effect that the conditions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above have been satisfied.

The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be administrative in nature.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing (and it is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law, and that such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties), (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or to exercise any discretionary power, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in the Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could expose the Administrative Agent to liability or be contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company, any Subsidiary or any other Affiliate thereof that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in the Loan Documents) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment).  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge 73of any Default unless and until written notice thereof (stating that it is a “notice of default”) is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company or any Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or satisfaction of any condition that expressly refers to the matters described therein being acceptable or satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall not incur any liability for relying, upon any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof).  The Administrative Agent also shall be entitled to rely, and shall not incur any liability for relying, upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents for being the maker thereof), and may act upon any such statement prior to receipt of written confirmation thereof.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it with reasonable care, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent (i) shall not have any liability arising from, or be responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered on account of, any determination by the Administrative Agent that any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or the effective date of such status, it being further understood and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall not have any obligation to determine whether any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, and (ii) shall not have any duty to ascertain, monitor or enforce compliance with the list of Disqualified Institutions and will not have any liability with respect to any assignment or participation made to a Disqualified Institution, it being further understood and agreed that the Administrative Agent will be authorized to disclose the list of Disqualified Institutions to the Lenders and the Lenders will be authorized to disclose such list, on a confidential basis, to potential assignees and participants.74The Administrative Agent may perform any of and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any of and all their duties and exercise their rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article VIII shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facility provided for herein as well as activities as the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any of its sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.Subject to the terms of this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time from its capacity as such.  In connection with such resignation, the Administrative Agent shall give notice of its intent to resign to the Lenders and the Company.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, subject to the consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) so long as no Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII shall have occurred and be continuing, to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its intent to resign, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.  If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Company and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, subject to the consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) so long as no Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII shall have occurred and be continuing, appoint a successor.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as an Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.  The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed by the Company and such successor.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its intent to resign, the retiring Administrative Agent may give notice of the effectiveness of its resignation to the Lenders and the Company, whereupon, on the date of effectiveness of such resignation stated in such notice, (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and (b) the Required Lenders shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, provided that (i) all payments required to be made hereunder 75or under any other Loan Document to the retiring Administrative Agent for the account of any Person other than the retiring Administrative Agent shall be made directly to such Person and (ii) all notices and other communications required or contemplated to be given or made to the retiring Administrative Agent shall also directly be given or made to each Lender.  Following the effectiveness of the Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal from its capacity as such, the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.03, as well as any exculpatory, reimbursement and indemnification provisions set forth in any other Loan Document, shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub‑agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent or any other Lender, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent or any other Lender, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement, or delivering its signature page to an Assignment and Assumption, an Accession Agreement or any other document pursuant to which it shall become a Lender hereunder, shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be delivered to, or be approved by or satisfactory to, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders on the Closing Date.In case of the pendency of any proceeding with respect to the Company under any United States (Federal or state) or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding-up or similar law now or hereafter in effect, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Company) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim under Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 9.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;76and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due to it, in its capacity as the Administrative Agent, under the Loan Documents (including under Section 9.03).Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent and their respective Affiliates, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Company, that at least one of the following is and will be true: (i) such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of 29 CFR § 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) of one or more Plans in connection with the Loans or the Commitments, (ii) the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as PTE 84-14 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers), PTE 95-60 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTE 91-38 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds) or PTE 96-23 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect to such Lender’s e

Waivers; Amendments.

The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim, litigation, investigation,

a failure to act by or on behalf of such Indemnitee or any injunctive relief or other non-monetary remedy.  The Company acknowledges that any failure to comply with its obligations under the preceding 83sentence may cause irreparable harm to the Indemnitees.

This paragraph (b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims or damages arising from any non-Tax claim. (c)  To the extent that the Company fails indefeasibly to pay any amount required under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party of any of the foregoing (and without limiting its obligation to do so), each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent).

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, sub-agents of the Administrative Agent, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section), the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of the foregoing) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section shall be treated for purposes of this 86Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 9.04(c).(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Company, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and records of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company and, as to entries pertaining to it, any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.(v) Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of an Assignment and Assumption (or an agreement incorporating by reference a form of Assignment and Assumption posted on the Platform) executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender) and the processing and recordation fee referred to in this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to accept such Assignment and Assumption or so record the information contained therein if the Administrative Agent reasonably believes that such Assignment and Assumption lacks any written consent required by this Section or is otherwise not in proper form, it being acknowledged that the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or obligation (and shall incur no liability) with respect to obtaining (or confirming the receipt) of any such written consent or with respect to the form of (or any defect in) such Assignment and Assumption, any such duty and obligation being solely with the assigning Lender and the assignee.  No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph, and following such recording, unless otherwise determined by the Administrative Agent (such determination to be made in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent, which determination may be conditioned on the consent of the assigning Lender and the assignee), shall be effective notwithstanding any defect in the Assignment and Assumption relating thereto.  Each assigning Lender and the assignee, by its execution and delivery of an Assignment and Assumption, shall be deemed to have represented to the Administrative Agent that all written consents required by this Section with respect thereto (other than the consent of the Administrative Agent) have been obtained and that such Assignment and Assumption is otherwise duly completed and in proper form, and each assignee, by its execution and delivery of an Assignment and Assumption, shall be deemed to have represented to the assigning Lender and the Administrative Agent that such assignee is an Eligible Assignee.(c)  (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Company or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more Eligible Assignees (“Participants”) 87in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and Loans); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Company, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant or requires the approval of all the Lenders.  The Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.14(f) (it being understood that the documentation req

Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or other rights and/or obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that any such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, 88the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as such) shall not have any responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.(d)  Any Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or grant to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or grant of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or grant of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.SECTION 9.05.  Survival.  All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Company in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto or thereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent, the Lenders or any Related Party of any of the foregoing may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any Loan Document was executed and delivered or any credit was extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any interest accrued on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid (other than contingent obligations for indemnification, expense reimbursement, tax gross-up or yield protection as to which no claim has been made) and so long as any of the Commitments have not expired or terminated.  The provisions of Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15(d), 2.15(e) and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans and the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.SECTION 9.06.  Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution.  (a)  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof, including the commitments of the Lenders and, if applicable, their Affiliates with respect to the credit facility established hereunder under any commitment advices submitted by any Lender.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company hereby (i) agrees that, for all purposes, including in connection with any workout, restructuring, enforcement of remedies, bankruptcy proceedings or litigation among the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Company, electronic images of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (in each case, including with respect to any signature pages thereto) shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as any paper original, and (ii) waives any argument, defense or right to contest the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other Loan Document based solely on the lack of paper original copies of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including with respect to any signature pages thereto.SECTION 9.07.  Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdict

The 90rights of each Lender and each Affiliate of any Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or Affiliate may have.  Each Lender agrees to notify the Company and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.SECTION 9.09.
