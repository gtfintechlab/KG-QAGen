(10) Business Days prior to the proposed date of a Loan, a Loan request substantially in the form of Schedule 2, and a receipt substantially in the form of Schedule 3. 
(b) Where any Loan of either Tranche is outstanding on any Scheduled Redetermination Date, the Borrower will be conclusively deemed to have
given IFC a duly completed request (and receipt) for a Rollover Loan (of an aggregate amount equal to the outstanding amount of all Loans of that Tranche, including any Rollover Loan, which are scheduled to mature on that Scheduled Redetermination
Date) to be applied in refinancing those outstanding Loans in full (and IFC is hereby authorized by the Borrower to apply such Rollover Loan to such refinancing) unless,   


 
(i)
such Scheduled Redetermination Date is a Reduction Date, in which case the amount of such Rollover Loan shall be reduced by the aggregate principal amount of the Loans of that Tranche that the Borrower is required to
repay in accordance with Section 3.05 on such Reduction Date; and/or   


 
(ii)
IFC at any time notifies the Borrower that all or a portion of any Loan is not eligible to be treated as a Rollover Loan because any other conditions necessary for the making of such Rollover Loan as required pursuant
to Section 5.02 and 5.03 hereof are not fulfilled; and/or   


 
(iii)
not later than thirty (30) days prior to such Scheduled Redetermination Date, the Borrower notifies IFC that it does not wish this provision to apply in respect of all or a portion of any Loan. 
(c) The Loans (other than the Rollover Loans) shall be requested and made under each Tranche in accordance with the respective Available
Amounts thereof; and each Loan (other than a Rollover Loan) shall be made in an amount of not less than five million Dollars ($5,000,000), or, if lower, in an amount that equals the maximum amount drawable of the Available Amount. 
(d) Each Loan (other than a Rollover Loan) shall be made by IFC at a bank in New York, New York for further credit to the VAALCO Operating

 (d) If, for any Interest Period IFC cannot determine LIBOR by reference to the Reuters Service or any other service that
displays BBA rates, IFC shall notify the Borrower and shall instead determine LIBOR:   


 
(i)

11:00 a.m., London time, for deposits in Dollars and otherwise in accordance with Section 3.03 (c)(ii), by any four (4) major banks active in Dollars in the London interbank market, selected by IFC; provided that if less than four

  - 39 - 




 
(ii)
if less than two (2) quotations are received from the banks in London in accordance with subsection (i) above, on the first day of the relevant Interest Period, by calculating the arithmetic mean (rounded

Market Disruption Event occurs in relation to all or any part of any Loan of any Tranche for any Interest Period, IFC shall promptly notify the Borrower of such event and the relevant Interest Rate for such Loans for that Interest Period shall be
the rate which is the sum of:   


 
(i)
the Relevant Spread; and   


 
(ii)
either (A) the rate which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to IFC (or the relevant Participant as notified to IFC as soon as practicable and in any event not later than the close of business on the
first day of the relevant Interest Period) of funding such Loan or such Participation (as applicable) from whatever source it may reasonably select or (B) at the option of IFC (or any such Participant, as applicable), LIBOR for the relevant
period as determined in accordance with Section 3.03 (c)(ii) above.   


 
(f)      (i)
If a Market Disruption Event occurs in relation to all or any part of any Loan and the Borrower so requires, within five (5) Business Days of the notification by IFC pursuant to Section 3.03 (e), IFC and the
Borrower shall enter into good faith negotiations (for a period of not more than thirty (30) days) with a view to agreeing a substitute basis for determining the rate of interest applicable to such Loan.

  - 40 - 


(g) On each Interest Determination Date for any Interest Period, IFC shall determine the Interest
Rate applicable to that Interest Period for each Tranche and promptly notify the Borrower of that rate.  (h) The determination by IFC, from
time to time, of the Interest Rate for each Tranche shall be final and conclusive and bind the Borrower (unless the Borrower shows to IFCs satisfaction that the determination involves manifest error).

annum and the Interest Rate in effect from time to time determined in accordance with Section 3.03 (Interest).  (b) Interest at

arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (including any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations and any dispute regarding the existence, validity or termination of this Agreement or the consequences of its nullity) (a
Dispute) and, for such purposes, irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. Final judgment against the Borrower in any such action, suit or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction,

process in England, IFC may by notice in writing to the Borrower appoint an agent to accept service on behalf of the Borrower, and the Borrower agrees that service on that agent will constitute valid service on it.

obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to which it is a party, from any suit, execution, attachment (whether provisional or final, in aid of execution, before judgment or otherwise) or other legal process or to the extent
that in any jurisdiction that immunity (whether or not claimed) may be attributed to it or its assets, the Borrower irrevocably agrees not to claim and irrevocably waives such immunity to the fullest extent permitted now or in the future by the laws
