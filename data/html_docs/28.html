pursuant to this <u>clause (e)</u> in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay, credit or offset such refund
to such Governmental Authority and the requirement to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority is not due to the indemnified
party’s failure to timely provide complete and accurate IRS forms and other documentation required pursuant to <u>Section
2.6(d)</u> or <u>Section 2.8</u>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this <u>clause (e)</u>, in no event will the indemnified
party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this <u>clause (e)</u> if the payment of such amount

not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its
Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.</p>

beneficial owner that is entitled to a payment of principal and stated interest on each Term Loan (the “<b>Register</b>”)

record in the manual or data processing records of the Collateral Agent, the date and amount of each advance and the amount of
the outstanding Obligations and the date and amount of each repayment of principal and each payment of interest or otherwise on
account of the Obligations. Absent manifest error, such records of the Collateral Agent shall be conclusive as to the outstanding
principal amount of the total outstanding Obligations, and the payment of interest, principal and other sums due hereunder; <u>provided</u>,

by any Lender only by (1) surrender of the old instrument and either (x) the reissuance by Borrower of the old instrument to the
new Lender or (y) the issuance by Borrower of a new instrument to the new Lender, or (2) confirmation with Borrower that
the right to the principal and stated interest on such Term Loan is maintained through the book entry system kept by the Collateral
Agent. Each Lender, severally and not jointly with any other Lender, represents that any interest that may become due and owing
under this Agreement qualifies for the portfolio interest exception from withholding on interest payments pursuant to IRC Sections 871(h)
