occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with <u>Section 2.03</u> or <u>2.04</u> that any such payment be financed with a U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Loan
that is an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan of the same amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to make
such payment when due (herein, the <u>Unreimbursed Amount</u>), the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lenders

the Issuing Lender for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Loans, Swingline Loans or Multicurrency Revolving Credit Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the

with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Lender, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or
delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence
arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Lender; <u>provided</u> that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Lender from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential
damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Lenders failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other
documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Lender (as finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented
which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation,

Agent and at the Borrowers risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account during the continuance of such Excess LC Exposure or

as a continuing condition to its receipt of such Information), (b) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process (in each such case, such Person shall notify the Borrower of such occurrence

nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Information shall not include, and each Lender (and each employee, representative or other agent of any Lender) may disclose to any and all
Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any

For the purposes of this Section, <u>Information</u> means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or any Affiliate of them, or any of their respective businesses, other
than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower; <u>provided</u> that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or
any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied

Agent, Issuing Lender, each Lender, the Borrower and each Guarantor to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, if any party hereto contracts for, charges, receives,
reserves, collects or takes any consideration from the Borrower or any other Obligor which constitutes interest in excess of the maximum amount permitted by applicable law or of the Maximum Rate, then any such excess shall be canceled automatically
and, if previously paid, shall at such Lenders option be applied to the outstanding amount of the loans made hereunder by such Lender to the Borrower or be refunded to such Obligor, and in no event shall any Person ever be liable for the
payment of unearned interest on, or in respect or any part of, the Obligations. In calculating all sums paid or agreed to be paid to any party hereto by a Borrower or any other Obligor for the use, forbearance, or detention of money under the Loan
Documents, (x) such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread in equal parts throughout the term of the Loan Documents, (y) the parties shall, to the maximum extent not
prohibited by applicable law, characterize any nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than interest, and (z) the parties shall exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof. To the extent lawful, the consideration
that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but was not payable as a result of the operation of this paragraph shall be cumulated and the consideration payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not
above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender. </font></p>

shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any other currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other
currency, such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the applicable Primary Currency with such other currency; if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased
is less than such sum due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) against such loss, and if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased exceeds such sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency,
such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) agrees to remit to the Borrower such excess. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">SECTION 10.15
