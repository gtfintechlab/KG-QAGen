Borrower has requested that the Lenders and the Administrative Agent enter into this Agreement to provide a revolving credit facility to the Borrower for the purposes set forth herein, and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent are willing to do
so on the terms and conditions set forth herein. In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows: 
ARTICLE 1 
DEFINITIONS 
Section 1.01 Certain Defined Terms. As used in this Agreement: 
Acquisition means any transaction or series of related transactions for the purpose of or resulting, directly or indirectly,
in (a) the acquisition by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of all or substantially all of the assets of a Person, or of any business or division of a Person, (b) the acquisition by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of in
excess of 50% of the capital stock, partnership interests, membership interests or equity of any Person (other than a Person that is a Subsidiary), or otherwise causing any Person to become a Subsidiary of the Borrower, (c) a merger or
consolidation or any other combination by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries with another Person (other than a Person that is a Subsidiary) provided that the Borrower (or a Person that succeeds to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.09 in
connection with such transaction or series of related transactions) or a Subsidiary of the Borrower (or a Person that becomes a Subsidiary of the Borrower as a result of such transaction) is the surviving entity; provided that any Person that is a
Subsidiary at the time of execution of the definitive agreement related to any such transaction or series of related transactions (or, in the case of a tender offer or similar transaction, at the time of filing of the definitive offer document)
shall constitute a Subsidiary for purposes of this definition even if in connection with such transaction or series of related transactions, such Person becomes a direct or indirect holding company of the Borrower or (d) the acquisition of real
property by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is expected to be used in whole or in part in the normal operations of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries. 
Acquisition Debt means any Indebtedness of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that has been issued for the purpose of
financing, in whole or in part, a Material Acquisition and any related transactions or series of related transactions (including for the purpose of refinancing or replacing all or a portion of any pre-existing
Indebtedness of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or the Person(s) or assets to be acquired); provided that (a)(i) the release of the proceeds thereof to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is contingent upon the consummation of such
Material Acquisition and, pending such release, such 





proceeds are held pursuant to an escrow or similar arrangement and (ii) if the definitive agreement (or, in the case of a tender offer or similar transaction, the definitive offer document)
for such Material Acquisition is terminated prior to the consummation of such Material Acquisition or if such Material Acquisition is otherwise not consummated by the date specified in the definitive documentation relating to such Indebtedness, such
proceeds shall be promptly applied to satisfy and discharge all obligations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of such Indebtedness for Borrowed Money or (b)(i) such Indebtedness contains a special mandatory redemption
provision (or other similar provision) or otherwise permits such Indebtedness to be redeemed or prepaid if such Material Acquisition is not consummated by the date specified in the definitive documentation relating to such Indebtedness for Borrowed
Money, and (ii) if the definitive agreement (or, in the case of a tender offer or similar transaction, the definitive offer document) for such Material Acquisition is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the consummation of such
Material Acquisition or such Material Acquisition is otherwise not consummated by the date specified in the definitive documentation relating to such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness is so redeemed or prepaid within ninety (90) days of such
termination or such specified date, as the case may be.  Actual Unused Commitments is defined in

management or policies of the controlled Person, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

Date (or any change in GAAP that occurred on or prior to the Effective Date but was not reflected in the financial statements included in the Borrower SEC Report) or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision, regardless of
whether any such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective
until such notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance herewith.

the Lenders shall automatically be released from their participation obligations with respect to any such Letter of Credit from and after the Facility Termination Date), and (iii) unless otherwise agreed by the applicable Issuing Lender and the
Borrower, be subject to ISP 98 and, to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of New York. No Issuing Lender shall at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit hereunder if (A) any order, judgment or decree of
any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to such Issuing Lender or any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall
impose upon such Issuing Lender with respect to letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular any restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated) not in effect on the
Effective Date, or any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense that was not applicable, in effect or known to such Issuing Lender as of the Effective Date and that such Issuing Lender in good faith deems material to it, (B) the issuance of the
Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such Issuing Lender applicable to letters of credit generally or (C) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are not satisfied. References herein to
issue and derivations thereof with respect to Letters of Credit shall also include extensions, increases or modifications of any outstanding Letters of Credit, unless the context otherwise requires. 
  34 




(b) Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, this Section 2.03 shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.20 and Section 2.21. 
(c) Procedures for Issuance and Disbursement of Letters of Credit. 
(i) The Borrower may from time to time request that any Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to such Issuing
Lender at its applicable office (with a copy to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents Office) an appropriately completed Letter of Credit Application therefor and such other certificates, documents and other papers and
information as such Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent may reasonably request. Upon receipt of any Letter of Credit Application and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as such Issuing Lender or the
Administrative Agent may reasonably request, the applicable Issuing Lender shall process such Letter of Credit Application in accordance with its customary procedures and shall, subject to this Section 2.03 and
Section 4.02, promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall such Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three (3) Business Days after its receipt of the
Letter of Credit Application therefor and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as such Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent may reasonably request) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the
beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed by such Issuing Lender and the Borrower. The applicable Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a copy of such Letter of Credit, and the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the issuance and, upon request by any Lender, furnish to such Lender a copy of such Letter of Credit and the amount of such Lenders participation therein. 
(ii) The Issuing Lender for any Letter of Credit shall, within the time allowed by applicable laws or the specific terms of the
Letter of Credit following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Lender shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower in writing of such demand for payment if such Issuing Lender has or will honor such demand for payment thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse such Issuing Lender and the L/C Participants with respect to such payment.  (d) Commissions and Other Charges. 
  35 




(i) Letter of Credit Fee. Subject to
Section 2.21, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender and the L/C Participants, a letter of credit commission with respect to each Letter of Credit in the amount
equal to the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit multiplied by the Applicable Margin with respect to Revolving Loans that are SOFR Loans (determined, in each case, on a per annum basis). Such commission shall be
payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date and after the Facility Termination Date on demand of the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, distribute to the applicable Issuing Lender and
the L/C Participants all commissions received pursuant to this Section 2.03 in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share. 
(ii) Issuance Fee. In addition to the foregoing commission, the Borrower shall pay directly to each Issuing Lender, for
its own account, an issuance fee with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender in an amount agreed by such Issuing Lender and the Borrower (it being understood and agreed that no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue a
Letter of Credit until such time as such Issuing Lender and the Borrower shall have agreed to such amount). Such issuance fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance
of such Letter of Credit, on the Facility Termination Date and thereafter on demand of the applicable Issuing Lender. 
(iii) Other Fees, Costs, Charges and Expenses. In addition to the foregoing fees and commissions, the Borrower shall pay
or reimburse each Issuing Lender for such normal and customary fees, costs, charges and expenses as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Lender in issuing, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit issued
by it.  (e) L/C Participations. 
(i) Each Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce each Issuing
Lender to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from each Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions hereinafter stated, for such L/C Participants
own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participants Pro Rata Share in each Issuing Lenders obligations and rights under and in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by it hereunder and the amount of each draft
paid by such Issuing Lender thereunder. Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with each Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender for which such Issuing Lender is not
reimbursed in full by the Borrower through a Revolving Loan or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender upon demand at such Issuing Lenders address for notices specified
herein the amount equal to such L/C Participants Pro Rata Share of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, which is not so reimbursed. 
  36 




(ii) Upon becoming aware of any amount required to be paid by any L/C
Participant to any Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(e)(i) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall notify
the Administrative Agent of such unreimbursed amount, and the Administrative Agent shall notify each L/C Participant (with a copy to the applicable Issuing Lender) of the amount and due date of such required payment and such L/C Participant shall
pay to the Administrative Agent (which, in turn shall pay such Issuing Lender) the amount specified on the applicable due date. If any such amount is paid to such Issuing Lender after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to
such Issuing Lender on demand, in addition to such amount, the product of (i) such amount times (ii) the Overnight Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent during the period from and including the date such payment is due to
the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Lender times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of such
Issuing Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03 shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. With respect to payment to such Issuing Lender of the unreimbursed amounts described in this
Section 2.03, if the L/C Participants receive notice that any such payment is due (A) prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on any Business Day, such payment shall be due that Business Day, and (B) after 1:00 p.m.
(New York time) on any Business Day, such payment shall be due on the following Business Day.  (iii) Whenever, at any time
after any Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit issued by it and has received from any L/C Participant its Pro Rata Share of such payment in accordance with this Section 2.03, such Issuing Lender
receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise), or any payment of interest on account thereof, such Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share
thereof; provided that in the event that any such payment received by such Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to such Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously
distributed by such Issuing Lender to it.  (iv) Each L/C Participants obligation to make the payments referred to in
Section 2.03(e)(ii) and to purchase participating interests pursuant to Section 2.03(d)(i) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any
setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Lender or the Borrower may have against the Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of an Unmatured
Default or Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 4.02, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document by the Borrower or any other Lender or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. 
  37 




(f) Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower. In the event of any drawing under any
Letter of Credit, the Borrower agrees to reimburse (either with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan as provided for in this Section 2.03 or with funds from other sources), in same day funds, the applicable Issuing Lender on
the first Business Day after the date on which such Issuing Lender notifies the Borrower of the date and amount of a draft paid by it under any Letter of Credit for the amount of (i) such draft so paid and (ii) any amounts referred to in
Section 2.03(d)(iii) incurred by such Issuing Lender in connection with such payment. Unless the Borrower shall promptly (and in any event not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the applicable repayment date) notify
such Issuing Lender (and the Administrative Agent) that the Borrower intends to reimburse such Issuing Lender for such drawing from other sources or funds, the Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a Borrowing Notice to the Administrative
Agent requesting that the Lenders make a Revolving Loan as an Alternate Base Rate Loan on the applicable repayment date in the amount of (i) such draft so paid and (ii) any amounts referred to in Section 2.03(d)(iii) incurred by such
Issuing Lender in connection with such payment, and the Lenders shall make a Revolving Loan as an Alternate Base Rate Loan in such amount on such first Business Day after the date of the notice from the applicable Issuing Lender (through the
Administrative Agent) to the Borrower referred to in the first sentence of this Section 2.03(f), the proceeds of which shall be applied to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the amount of the related drawing and such fees and expenses. Each
Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to fund a Revolving Loan in accordance with this Section 2.03 to reimburse such Issuing Lender for any draft paid under a Letter of Credit issued by it is absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, non-satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Section 2.03 or
Section 4.02. If the Borrower has elected to pay the amount of such drawing with funds from other sources and shall fail to reimburse such Issuing Lender as provided above, the unreimbursed amount of such drawing shall bear
interest at the rate which would be payable on any outstanding Alternate Base Rate Loans which were then overdue from the date such amounts become payable (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) until payment in full. 
(g) Obligations Absolute. The Borrowers obligations under this Section 2.03 (including, without
limitation, the Reimbursement Obligation) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein
being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any setoff,
counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have had against the applicable Issuing Lender or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit. No Issuing Lender shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in
transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it, except for errors or omissions, interruptions or delays caused by such Issuing Lenders gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the terms of this Agreement, as determined by a court of competent 
  38 





jurisdiction by final nonappealable judgment. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it or the
related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct of its obligations under this Agreement, or such Issuing Lenders willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by
the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit, in the case of any such willful failure to pay, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and non-appealable judgment, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to the Borrower. The responsibility of any Issuing Lender to the Borrower
in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit issued to it shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each
draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment substantially conform to the requirements under such Letter of Credit. 
(h) Effect of Letter of Credit Application. To the extent that any provision of any Letter of Credit Application related to any Letter
of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 2.03, the provisions of this Section 2.03 shall apply. 
(i) Resignation of Issuing Lenders. (i) Any Lender may at any time resign from its role as an Issuing Lender hereunder upon not
less than thirty (30) days prior notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period of time as may be acceptable to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent); provided that (a) it shall have assigned all of its
Commitments and Loans pursuant to Section 12.01(b) hereof at or prior to the time of such resignation and (b) another Lender acceptable to the Borrower shall have assumed the L/C Commitments of such resigning Issuing Lender (and, to the
extent such assuming Lender was not an Issuing Lender hereunder, such assuming Lender shall have become an Issuing Lender hereunder). 
(ii) Any resigning Issuing Lender shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an Issuing Lender hereunder
with respect to all Letters of Credit issued by it that are outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an Issuing Lender and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including, without limitation, the right to require the Lenders to
take such actions as are required under Section 2.03(e)).  (j) Reporting of Letter of Credit Information and
L/C Commitment. At any time that there is an Issuing Lender that is not also the financial institution acting as Administrative Agent, then (a) on the last Business Day of each calendar month, (b) on each date that a Letter of Credit
is amended, terminated or otherwise expires, (c) on each date that a Letter of Credit is issued or the expiry date of a Letter of Credit is extended, and (d) upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender (or, in the
case of clauses (b), (c) or (d) of this Section 2.03(j), the applicable Issuing Lender) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a report setting forth in form and detail reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent information (including, without limitation, any reimbursement, Cash Collateral, or termination in respect of Letters of Credit issued by 
  39 





such Issuing Lender) with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender that is outstanding hereunder. In addition, each Issuing Lender shall provide notice to the Administrative
Agent of its L/C Commitment, or any change thereto, promptly upon it becoming an Issuing Lender or making any change to its L/C Commitment (it being understood that any change to the L/C Commitment of any Issuing Lender shall only be made in
accordance with the terms of the definition of L/C Commitment). No failure on the part of any Issuing Lender to provide such information pursuant to this Section 2.03(j) shall limit the obligations of the
Borrower or any Lender hereunder with respect to its reimbursement and participation obligations hereunder.  (k) Letters of Credit
Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse, or to cause the
applicable Subsidiary to reimburse, the applicable Issuing Lender hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of any of its Subsidiaries
inures to the benefit of the Borrower and that the Borrowers business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries. 
(l) Existing Letters of Credit. As of the Effective Date, each Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed a Letter of Credit issued
hereunder for all purposes under this Agreement without need for any further action by the Borrower or any other Person. 
Section 2.04 Types of Advances. The Advances may consist of Alternate Base Rate Loans or SOFR Loans,
or a combination thereof, selected by the Borrower in accordance with Sections 2.08 and 2.09. 
Section 2.05 Fees; Reductions in Aggregate Commitment. 
(a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee in Dollars
(the Commitment Fee) at a per annum rate equal to the percentage set forth under the heading Commitment Fee in the Pricing Schedule on the daily actual excess of such Lenders Commitment over such Lenders
Outstanding Credit Exposure (such excess, such Lenders Actual Unused Commitments) as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.05(c) from and including the Effective Date to and including the date on which
this Agreement is terminated in full and all Obligations hereunder (other than contingent indemnity obligations) have been paid in full pursuant to Section 2.02, payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date;
provided that no Commitment Fee shall accrue hereunder with respect to the Actual Unused Commitment of a Defaulting Lender so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender. 
(b) Fee Letter. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account fees in Dollars in the amounts and at the times
specified in the applicable Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall be non-refundable for any reason whatsoever. 
  40 




(c) Reductions in Aggregate Commitment. The Borrower may permanently reduce the
Aggregate Commitment in whole, or in part ratably (except as provided in Section 2.18) among the Lenders, in integral multiples of $3,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, by giving the
Administrative Agent notice of such reduction not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on any Business Day, which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction and which notice may be conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events
specified therein; provided, however, that the amount of the Aggregate Commitment may not be reduced below the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure. All accrued Commitment Fees shall be payable on the effective date of any termination
of all of the obligations of the Lenders to make Revolving Loans.  Section 2.06 Minimum Amount of Each
Advance. Each SOFR Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 (and in multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof) and each Alternate Base Rate Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $3,000,000 (and in multiples of $1,000,000 if in
excess thereof); provided, however, that any SOFR Advance or Alternate Base Rate Advance may be in the amount of the unused Aggregate Commitment. The Borrower shall not request a SOFR Advance if, after giving effect to the requested
SOFR Advance, more than ten (10) Interest Periods would be in effect (unless such limit has been waived by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion). 
Section 2.07 Prepayments, Optional Prepayments. The Borrower may from time to time pay, without
penalty or premium, all of its outstanding Alternate Base Rate Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $3,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, any portion of its outstanding Alternate Base Rate Advances, upon
prior notice to the Administrative Agent substantially in the form of Exhibit C, or such other form as may be approved by the Administrative Agent (including any form on an electronic platform or electronic transmission system as shall be
approved by the Administrative Agent) appropriately completed and signed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the applicable prepayments at or before 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the
date of such payment. The Borrower may from time to time pay, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.04 but without penalty or premium, all of its outstanding SOFR Advances, or,
in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, any portion of its outstanding SOFR Advances upon prior notice to the Administrative Agent substantially in the form of Exhibit C, or such
other form as may be approved by the Administrative Agent (including any form on an electronic platform or electronic transmission system as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent) appropriately completed and signed by an Authorized Officer
of the Borrower stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the applicable prepayments at or before 11:00 a.m. (New York time) at least three (3) Business Days prior, in the case of any SOFR Advances, to the date of such payment
(or, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.04, such other prior notice as the Administrative Agent may agree to). Subject to Section 2.21, each such
prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Revolving Loans of the Lenders included in such Revolving Borrowing in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share. Any notice delivered pursuant to this
Section 2.07 may be conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein. 
  41 




Section 2.08 Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for
New Advances. The Borrower shall select the Type of Advance and, in the case of each SOFR Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto from time to time. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice (which notice may be conditioned
on the satisfaction or waiver (in accordance with Section 8.02) of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02) substantially in the form of Exhibit E or such other form as may be approved by
the Administrative Agent (including any form on an electronic platform or electronic transmission system as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent), in each case appropriately completed and signed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower (a
Borrowing Notice) not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Borrowing Date of each Alternate Base Rate Advance and 11:00 a.m. (New York time) three (3) Business Days before the Borrowing Date for each SOFR Advance. A
Borrowing Notice shall specify:  (a) the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such Advance, 
(b) the aggregate amount of such Advance, 
(c) the Type of Advance selected, 
(d) in the case of each SOFR Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto, and 
(e) the location and number of the Borrowers account to which proceeds of the Advance are to be disbursed. 
If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested SOFR Advance, the Borrower will be deemed to have selected an Interest Period
of one months duration.  Section 2.09 Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances.
Alternate Base Rate Advances shall continue as Alternate Base Rate Advances unless and until such Alternate Base Rate Advances are converted into SOFR Advances pursuant to this Section 2.09 or are repaid in accordance with
Section 2.07. Each SOFR Advance shall continue as a SOFR Advance until the end of the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time such SOFR Advance shall be automatically converted into an Alternate Base Rate
Advance, unless (x) such SOFR Advance is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.07 or (y) the Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period,
such SOFR Advance continue as a SOFR Advance for the same or another Interest Period. Subject to the terms of Section 2.06, the Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part of an Alternate Base Rate
Advance into a SOFR Advance. No Advance may be converted into or continued as an Advance denominated in a different currency, but instead must be repaid in the original currency of such Advance and reborrowed in the other currency. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.09, when any Default has occurred and is continuing no Dollar-denominated Advance may be converted or continued as a SOFR Advance (except with the consent of the Required
Lenders) The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice substantially in the form of Exhibit F (a Conversion/Continuation Notice) or such other form as may be approved by the

  42 





Administrative Agent (including any form on an electronic platform or electronic transmission system as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent), in each case appropriately completed and
signed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower, of each conversion of an Alternate Base Rate Advance into a SOFR Advance or continuation of a SOFR Advance not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
date of the requested conversion or continuation, specifying:  (a) the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such conversion or
continuation,  (b) the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is to be converted or continued as a SOFR Advance, and 
(c) the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto. 
Section 2.10 Interest Rates. Each Alternate Base Rate Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance is made or is converted from a SOFR Advance into an Alternate Base Rate Advance, to but excluding the date it is paid or is converted into a SOFR Advance pursuant to
Section 2.09 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained as an Alternate Base Rate
Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Each SOFR Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at Adjusted Term SOFR for the applicable period plus the Applicable Margin. No Interest Period may end after the Facility Termination Date. 
Section 2.11 Rates Applicable After Default. During the continuance of a Default under
Section 7.02 the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.02
requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates and which election and notice shall not be required after a Default or Unmatured Default under Section 7.05 or 7.06), declare that interest on
the overdue amount of the Loans shall be payable at a rate (after as well as before the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws) equal to 2% per annum in excess of the rate otherwise payable thereon (and, with respect to any
other overdue amounts, shall bear interest at a rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin applicable to Alternate Base Rate Loans plus 2% per annum) commencing on the date of such Default and continuing until such
Default is cured or waived.  Section 2.12 Method of Payment. Except as otherwise specified herein, all
payments by the Borrower of principal, interest, fees and its other Obligations shall be made in Dollars. All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to the
Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents address specified pursuant to Article 13, or at any other Lending Installation of the Administrative Agent specified in writing by the Administrative

  43 





Agent to the Borrower, by 1:00 p.m. (New York time), on the date when due and shall be applied ratably by the Administrative Agent among the Lenders entitled thereto. Each payment to the
Administrative Agent of any Issuing Lenders fees or L/C Participants commissions shall be made in like manner, but for the account of such Issuing Lender or the L/C Participants, as the case may be. Each payment delivered to the
Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at such Lenders address specified pursuant to Article
13 or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Administrative Agent from such Lender. 
Section 2.13 Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness. 
(a) Each Lender and each Issuing Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the extensions
of credit made by such Lender or Issuing Lender, as applicable, to the Borrower from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. 
(b) The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (A) the date and the amount of each Loan made
hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period, if any, applicable thereto, (B) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, (C) the effective date
and amount of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to and accepted by it and the parties thereto pursuant to Section 12.01, (D) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and
each Lenders share thereof, and (E) all other appropriate debits and credits as provided in this Agreement, including, without limitation, all fees, charges, expenses and interest. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and
records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control absent manifest error. 
(c) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) above shall be prima facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in
any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay its Obligations in accordance with their terms.  (d) In addition to the accounts
and records referred to in clauses (a) and (b) above, each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in
Letters of Credit. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall
control in the absence of manifest error. 
  44 




(e) Any Lender may request that the Loans made or to be made by it be evidenced by a
promissory note in substantially the form of Exhibit D (each, a Note). In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender such Note or Notes payable to such Lender (or its registered assigns).
Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by each such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.01) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the payee named therein or
any assignee pursuant to Section 12.01, except to the extent that any such Lender or assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in
clauses (a) and (b) above.  Section 2.14 Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis;
Term SOFR Conforming Changes. Interest accrued on each Alternate Base Rate Advance shall be payable in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Effective Date and on any date on which the Alternate
Base Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal amount of any Alternate Base Rate Advance converted into a SOFR Advance on a day other than a Payment Date shall be
payable on the date of conversion. Interest accrued on each SOFR Advance shall be payable in arrears on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which such SOFR Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and on
the Facility Termination Date. Interest accrued on each SOFR Advance having an Interest Period longer than three (3) months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period. Interest accrued
pursuant to Section 2.11 shall be payable on demand. With respect to (a) interest on all Advances (other than Alternate Base Rate Loans), Commitment Fees and other fees hereunder, such interest or fees shall be
calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year and (b) interest on Advances which are Alternate Base Rate Loans, such interest shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis
of a 365/366 day year. Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received by 1:00 p.m. (New York time). If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance, any
fees or any other amounts payable to any Agent or any Lender hereunder shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of
time shall be included in computing interest, fees and commissions in connection with such payment. In connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time
and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR. 
Section 2.15 Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment Reductions; Availability of
Revolving Loans. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice and prepayment notice received by
it hereunder. The Administrative Agent will notify each 
  45 





Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Not later than 1:00
p.m. (New York time). The Administrative Agent will make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the Borrower at the Administrative Agents aforesaid address not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York time). 
Section 2.16 Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending Installation selected by
such Lender and may change its Lending Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any
such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in accordance with Article 13, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by it and for
whose account Loan payments are to be made.  Section 2.17 Payments Generally; Administrative
Agents Clawback.  (a) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. In connection with
any borrowing hereunder, the Administrative Agent may assume that each Lender has made its respective share of such borrowing available on such date in accordance with Section 2.15 and may, in reliance upon such assumption,
make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Advance available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to
the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Alternate Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and
such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender
pays its share of the applicable Advance to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Revolving Loan included in such Advance. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the
Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.  (b) Payments by Borrower;
Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Lender
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the
applicable Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Lender, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. 
  46 




A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any
amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  (c) Obligations of Lenders Several. The
obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Loans, to issue or participate in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to Section 9.06(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any
Revolving Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 9.06(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Revolving Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 9.06(c). 
Section 2.18 Replacement of Lender. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.01 or 3.02, or if any Lender gives notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.07(b), or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.05, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Declining Lender, or if a Lender fails to consent to an amendment or waiver approved by the Required Lenders as
to any matter for which such Lenders consent is needed, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance
with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 12.01), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume
such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:  (a) The Borrower shall have
paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 12.01(b)(iv);  (b) such Lender shall
have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and funded participations in Letter of Credit draws, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.04) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
(c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.01 or payments
required to be made pursuant to Section 3.05, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
(d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable laws; and 
  47 




(e) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a failure to consent to an amendment
or waiver approved by the Required Lenders, such assignee shall have consented to the relevant amendment or waiver.  A Lender shall not be
required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
Section 2.19 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. Except as otherwise specified herein, if any Lender shall, by
exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it, resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such
Loans and accrued interest thereon greater than its Pro Rata Share to which it is entitled pursuant hereto, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for
cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of
principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them; provided that:  (a) if any such
participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
(b) the provisions of this Section 2.19 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower
pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender or payments made on any Existing Stated Maturity Date pursuant to
Section 2.23), (y) the application of Cash Collateral as provided in Section 2.20 or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in
any of its Loans or subparticipations in Letters of Credit to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary (as to which the provisions of this Section 2.19 shall apply). 
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.  Section 2.20 Cash Collateral. 
(a) Cash Collateralization. If there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one (1) Business Day following the written
request of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the Fronting Exposure of the Issuing Lenders with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving
effect to Section 2.21 and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount. 
  48 




(b) Grant of Security Interest. The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any
Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting
Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations, to be applied pursuant to clause (c) below. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of
any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lenders as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative
Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). 
(c) Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this
Section 2.20 or 8.01 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations (including, as to Cash
Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein. 
(d) Termination of Requirement. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce the Fronting Exposure of any
Issuing Lender shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.20 following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting
Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lenders that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to Section 2.21, the Person
providing Cash Collateral and the Issuing Lenders may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations. 
Section 2.21 Defaulting Lenders. 
(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then,
until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:  (b) Waivers and
Amendments. That Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 8.02 and the definition of Required
Lender. 
  49 




(c) Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other
amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 8.01 or otherwise,
and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.01) shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:
first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Lender
hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the Fronting Exposure of the Issuing Lenders with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.20 with a corresponding release of any Cash Collateral provided
by the Borrower and/or a reversal of any reallocations made among the Lenders with respect to such Fronting Exposure pursuant to Section 2.21(e); fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Unmatured Default exists), to
the funding of any Loan or funded participation in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released in order to (A) satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans and funded participations under
this Agreement and (B) Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with
Section 2.20; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or any Issuing Lender against
that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Unmatured Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of
any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to that Defaulting Lender or as
otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or funded participations in Letters of Credit in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully
funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied
first to pay the Loans of, and funded participations in Letters of Credit owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or funded
participations in Letters of Credit owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Aggregate Commitment
under the Revolving Credit Facility without giving effect to Section 2.22(d). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting
Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
(d) Certain Fees. The Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee pursuant to
Section 2.05(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender. Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive letter of credit commissions pursuant to Section 2.03 for any
period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Pro Rata Share of the stated amount 
  50 





of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.20. With respect to any letter of credit commission not required to be paid to any
Defaulting Lender, the Borrower shall (1) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lenders
participation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (e) below, (2) pay to each applicable Issuing Lender the amount of any such fee otherwise
payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (3) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. 
(e) Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders participation in L/C
Obligations shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Commitment) but only to the
extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders
Commitment. Subject to Section 15.07, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting
Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation. 
(f) Cash Collateral. If the reallocation described in clause (e) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the
Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.20.
 (g) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lenders agree in writing in their sole
discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth
therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Revolving Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Loans and
funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be
made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no
change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. 
(h) New Letters of Credit. So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue, extend,
increase, reinstate or renew any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto. 
  51 




Section 2.22 Incremental Loans. At any time after the
Effective Date and prior to the Facility Termination Date, the Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent elect to request the establishment of one or more increases in the Aggregate Commitment (any such increase, an
Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment) to make revolving credit loans under the Revolving Credit Facility (any such increase, an Incremental Revolving Credit Increase); provided that (1) the total
aggregate principal amount for all such increases during the term of this Agreement shall not exceed $500,000,000 and (2) the total aggregate amount for each Incremental Revolving Credit Increase shall not be less than $25,000,000 or, if less,
the remaining amount permitted pursuant to the foregoing clause (1). Each such notice shall specify the date (each, an Increased Amount Date) on which the Borrower proposes that any Incremental Revolving Credit Increase
shall be effective. The Borrower may invite any Lender, any Affiliate of any Lender and/or any Approved Fund, and/or any other Person reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to provide an Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment (any such
Person, an Incremental Lender). Any Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments shall become effective as of such Increased Amount Date; provided that: 
(a) no Unmatured Default or Default shall exist on such Increased Amount Date; 
(b) each of the representations and warranties contained in Article 5 shall be true and correct in all material respects, except to the
extent any such representation and warranty is qualified by materiality or reference to Material Adverse Effect, in which case, such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects, on such Increased Amount Date with the same
effect as if made on and as of such date (except for any such representation and warranty that by its terms is made only as of an earlier date, which representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all material respects (except to the
extent any such representation and warranty is qualified by materiality or reference to Material Adverse Effect, in which case, such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects) as of such earlier date); 
(c) in the case of each Incremental Revolving Credit Increase: 
(i) the outstanding Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations will be reallocated by the Administrative Agent on the applicable
Increased Amount Date among the Lenders (including the Incremental Lenders providing such Incremental Revolving Credit Increase) in accordance with their revised Pro Rata Share (and the Lenders (including the Incremental Lenders providing such
Incremental Revolving Credit Increase) agree to make all payments and adjustments necessary to effect such reallocation and the Borrower shall pay any and all costs required pursuant to Section 3.04 in connection with such
reallocation as if such reallocation were a repayment); and  (ii) such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments shall be
effected pursuant to one or more Lender Joinder Agreements executed and delivered by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the applicable Incremental Lenders (which Lender Joinder Agreement(s) may, without the consent of any other Lenders,
effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.22); 
  52 




(d) No existing Lender shall be obligated to participate in any Incremental Revolving Credit
Increase, and each Lenders decision to provide (or not provide) an Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment in any instance shall be made in such Lenders sole and absolute discretion in each case. 
(e) On any Increased Amount Date on which any Incremental Revolving Credit Increase becomes effective, subject to the foregoing terms and
conditions, each Incremental Lender with an Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment shall become a Lender hereunder. 
Section 2.23 Extension. On not more than two occasions following the Effective Date during the term of this
Agreement, and no more than once in any 12-month period, the Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders) no earlier than 60 days and
no later than 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of an extension (such date of effectiveness, an Extension Date), request that the Lenders extend the Stated Maturity Date and the Commitments for a period of one year from
the Stated Maturity Date then in effect hereunder (the then Existing Stated Maturity Date). Each Lender shall, by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, given no later than 15 days (or such other date specified by
the Borrower in such written notice delivered pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence or any supplement thereto) after such written notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent, advise the Borrower whether or not it agrees to the requested
extension (each Lender agreeing to a requested extension, a Consenting Lender and each Lender declining to agree to a requested extension, a Declining Lender). Any Lender that has not so advised the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent by the applicable deadline shall be deemed to have declined to agree to such extension and shall be a Declining Lender (unless such Lender subsequently agrees to such requested extension and the Borrower elects in its sole
discretion to treat such Lender as a Consenting Lender). If Lenders constituting the Required Lenders shall have agreed to any such extension request, then the Stated Maturity Date shall, as to the Consenting Lenders and any Lender replacing a
Declining Lender, be extended on the Extension Date to the date that is one year after the then Existing Stated Maturity Date. The decision to agree or withhold agreement to any Stated Maturity Date extension request shall be at the sole discretion
of each Lender. The Commitment of any Declining Lender shall terminate on the Existing Stated Maturity Date applicable to such Declining Lender. The principal amount of any outstanding Loans made by Declining Lenders, together with any accrued
interest thereon and any accrued fees and other amounts payable to or for the accounts of such Declining Lenders hereunder, shall be due and payable on the Existing Stated Maturity Date applicable to such Declining Lenders, and on the Existing
Stated Maturity Date applicable to such Declining Lenders, the Borrower shall also make such other prepayments of Loans as shall be required in order that, after giving effect to the termination of the Commitments of, and all payments to, Declining
Lenders pursuant to this sentence, the sum of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments. 
  53 





Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Borrower shall have the right, pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of Section 12.01, at any time prior to any
Existing Stated Maturity Date, to cause a Declining Lender to assign its interests, rights and obligations hereunder to a Lender or (subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), solely to the extent such consent would be required for an assignment pursuant to Section 12.01) other Eligible Assignee that agrees to a request for the extension of the Existing Stated Maturity Date, and any such assignee shall for
all purposes constitute a Consenting Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no extension of the Stated Maturity Date pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective unless (i) on the applicable Extension Date, no Unmatured Default or Default
has occurred and is continuing, (ii) each of the representations and warranties set forth in Article 5 of this Agreement is true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent such representations and warranties are qualified
with materiality or Material Adverse Effect or similar terms, in which case such representations and warranties are true and correct in all respects) as of such Extension Date, except to the extent any such representation or
warranty is stated to relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such representation or warranty shall have been true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent such representations and warranties are qualified with
materiality or Material Adverse Effect or similar terms, in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all respects) on and as of such earlier date, (iii) the remaining maturity of
the Commitments, after giving effect to such extension, does not exceed five years from the applicable Extension Date and (iv) the Administrative Agent shall have received an officers certificate, signed by an Authorized Officer of the
Borrower, certifying that the foregoing conditions (i) and (ii) are satisfied as of the applicable Extension Date.  ARTICLE 3 
YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES 
Section 3.01 Yield Protection. If, on or after the date of this Agreement, any Change in Law: 
(i) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in Term SOFR) or any Issuing Lender; 
(ii) subjects any Lender or Issuing Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
covered by Section 3.05 and Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 
(iii) imposes on any Lender or any Issuing Lender any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or SOFR Loans
made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 
  54 




and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, continuing,
converting to or maintaining any SOFR Loans (or, in the case of a Change in Law with respect to Taxes, any Loan) or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Lender of participating in,
issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Lender hereunder (whether of
principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing
Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender or Issuing Lender shall be entitled to seek compensation under this Section 3.01 unless such
Lender or Issuing Lender is generally seeking compensation from other borrowers that are similarly situated to and of similar creditworthiness with respect to its similarly affected commitments, loans and/or participations under agreements with such
borrowers having provisions similar to this Section 3.01.  Section 3.02 Changes in
Capital Adequacy Regulations; Certificates for Reimbursement; Delay in Requests.   (a) Changes in Capital Adequacy. If
any Lender or Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law after the date of this Agreement affecting such Lender or Issuing Lender or any Lending Installation of such Lender or Issuing Lender or such Lenders or Issuing Lenders
holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or Issuing Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders or Issuing Lenders
holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender to a level below
that which such Lender or Issuing Lender or such Lenders or Issuing Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or Issuing Lenders policies and the policies
of such Lenders or Issuing Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender or Issuing Lender such Lenders or Issuing Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender or Issuing Lender shall be entitled to seek compensation under this
Section 3.02 unless such Lender or Issuing Lender is generally seeking compensation from other borrowers that are similarly situated to and of similar creditworthiness with respect to its similarly affected commitments,
loans and/or participations under agreements with such borrowers having provisions similar to this Section 3.02. 
(b) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender, such Issuing Lender or their respective holding companies, as the case may be, as specified in Section 3.01 or subsection (a) of this Section 3.02 and delivered to the
Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay to such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof.

(c) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Lender
to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.02 or Section 3.01 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or Issuing Lenders right to demand such
compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.02 or
Section 3.01 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions and of such Lenders or Issuing Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to
above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).  (d) Additional Reserve Requirements. The Borrower
shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the
Commitments, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such
Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have received at least thirty (30) days prior notice (with
a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional costs from such Lender. Such Lender shall deliver a certificate to the Borrower setting forth in reasonable detail a calculation of such actual costs incurred by such Lender and shall certify
that it is generally charging such costs to similarly situated customers of similar creditworthiness of the applicable Lender under agreements having provisions similar to this Section 3.02(d) If a Lender fails to give
notice thirty (30) days prior to the relevant interest payment date, such additional costs shall be due and payable thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid under this
Section 3.02(d) shall be without duplication of adjustments in the definition of Adjusted Term SOFR. 
Section 3.03 [Reserved]. 
Section 3.04 Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such
Lender or such Issuing Lender for and hold such Lender or such Issuing Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than an Alternate Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of
the Interest Period for such Loan or other than upon at least three (3) Business Days prior notice to the Administrative Agent (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise, but excluding any prepayment
or conversion required pursuant to Section 3.07(b)); 
  56 




(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make
a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than an Alternate Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; 
(c) [reserved]; or  (d)
any assignment of a SOFR Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18; 
including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds or from any fees payable, in each case, to terminate the deposits, if any,
from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. 
Section 3.05 Taxes. 
(a) Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes. 
(i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to
the extent permitted by applicable laws be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes. If, however, applicable laws require the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to withhold or deduct any such Tax, such Tax shall be
withheld or deducted in accordance with such laws as determined by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below. 
(ii) If the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by applicable law to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any
payment under any Loan Document, then (A) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to be required based upon
the information and documentation it, or the applicable taxing authority, has received pursuant to subsection (e) below (for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of any such information and documentation received by an applicable taxing
authority, solely to the extent the Borrower or the Administrative Agent has been provided with a copy of such information and documentation or otherwise has actual knowledge of such information and documentation and, in each case, is entitled to
rely thereon), (B) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, and (C) to the extent that the
withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.05) the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Issuing Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been
made. 
  57 




(b) Payment of Other Taxes. Without limiting the provisions of subsection
(a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable laws. 
(c) Indemnification. 
(i) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender and each Issuing Lender and shall make payment in respect thereof within thirty (30) days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed
or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.05) withheld or deducted by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Issuing Lender, and any
penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the
amount of any such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or Issuing Lender, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.  (ii) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, each Lender
and Issuing Lender shall, and does hereby, indemnify (x) the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within thirty (30) days after demand therefor, against any and all Taxes and any and all related
losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Borrower or the Administrative Agent by any
Governmental Authority as a result of (1) the failure by such Lender to deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any documentation required to be delivered by such Lender or Issuing Lender to the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 3.05(e) or (2) the failure of such Lender or Issuing Lender to comply with the provisions of Section 12.01(d) relating to the maintenance of a
Participant Register and (y) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes attributable to such Lender or Issuing Lender (but only to the extent the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) or Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender or Issuing Lender, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not
such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. Each Lender and Issuing Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all 
  58 





amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii). The agreements in this
clause (ii) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or
discharge of all other Obligations.  (d) Evidence of Payments. Upon request by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.05, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative
Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by law to report such payment or other evidence of
such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the -Administrative Agent, as the case may be.  (e) Status of Lenders and
Issuing Lenders; Tax Documentation.  (i) Each Lender and Issuing Lender shall deliver to the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or the applicable taxing authority, at the time or times prescribed by applicable laws or when reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by
applicable laws or by the taxing authorities of any jurisdiction and such other reasonably requested information (A) to secure any applicable exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, deduction or withholding imposed by any jurisdiction in
respect of any payments to be made by the Borrower to such Lender or Issuing Lender, and (B) as will permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine (1) whether or not payments made hereunder or under any
other Loan Document are subject to Taxes, (2) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction, and (3) such Lenders or Issuing Lenders entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes
in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender or Issuing Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lenders or Issuing Lenders status for withholding tax purposes in the applicable
jurisdiction.  (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower (or, if the Borrower is disregarded
as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Person treated as its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, 
(A) any Lender or Issuing Lender (or, if such Lender or Issuing Lender is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Person treated as its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the

  59 





Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender or Issuing Lender becomes an Issuing Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable laws or reasonably requested by
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender or Issuing Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements;
 (B) each Foreign Lender or non-U.S. Issuing Lender (or, if such Foreign Lender or
Issuing Lender is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Person treated as its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is entitled under the Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption
from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the
date on which such Foreign Lender or Issuing Lender becomes a Lender or Issuing Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender or Issuing
Lender (or, if such Foreign Lender or Issuing Lender is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Person treated as its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is legally entitled to do so),
whichever of the following is applicable:  (1) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-BEN-E, as applicable, claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, 
(2) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, 
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender or non-U.S. Issuing Lender (or, if such Foreign
Lender or Issuing Lender is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Person treated as its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest
under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender or Issuing Lender (or such other Person) is not (A) a
bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign
corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, 
  60 




(4) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY and all required supporting documentation, including IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form
W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit
H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Lender or Issuing Lender is a partnership
and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Lender or Issuing Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Lender or Issuing Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner, or  (5) executed originals of
any other form prescribed by applicable laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable laws to permit the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.  (C) each Lender and Issuing Lender
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower such documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower sufficient for the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to comply with their obligations under FATCA and
to determine whether payments to such Lender or Issuing Lender are subject to withholding tax under FATCA. Solely for purposes of this subclause (C), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this
Agreement.  (iii) Each Lender and Issuing Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender or Issuing Lender and as
may be reasonably necessary (including the redesignation of its Lending Installation) to avoid any requirement of applicable laws of any jurisdiction that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent make any withholding or deduction for taxes from
amounts payable to such Lender or Issuing Lender. 
  61 




(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable laws, at no time
shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or Issuing Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or Issuing Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for
the account of such Lender or Issuing Lender. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Issuing Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the
Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.05, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or
additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 3.05 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest (to the extent accrued from
the date such refund is paid over to the Borrower) or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority), to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to
such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would
place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed
and the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Issuing Lender to make available its Tax returns (or
any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
Section 3.06 Mitigation Obligations. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.01 or Section 3.02, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or Issuing Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or Issuing Lender
pursuant to Section 3.05, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.07(b), then such Lender or Issuing Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Installation
for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or Issuing Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would
eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01, 3.02 or 3.05, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.07(b), as
applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or Issuing Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees
to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or Issuing Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
  62 




Section 3.07 Inability to Determine Rates; Replacing
Benchmarks  (a) Circumstances Affecting Benchmark Availability. Subject to clause (c) below, in connection with any
request for a SOFR Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, if (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for
ascertaining Adjusted Term SOFR for the applicable Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan on or prior to the first day of such Interest Period or (ii) the Required Lenders determine (which determination shall be conclusive and
binding absent manifest error) that Adjusted Term SOFR does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans during such Interest Period and, in the case of clause (ii), the Required Lenders have
provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, then, in each case, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower. Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, any obligation of
the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to convert any Loan to or continue any Loan as a SOFR Loan, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or the affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent
(with respect to clause (ii), at the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the
extent of the affected SOFR Loans or the affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to Alternate Base Rate Loans in the amount specified
therein and (B) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted into Alternate Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued
interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.04. 
(b) Laws Affecting SOFR Availability. If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, or any change in, any applicable law has
made it unlawful or impossible, or any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful or impossible, for any of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Installations) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any SOFR
Loan, or to determine or charge interest based upon SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly give
notice to the Borrower and the other Lenders (an Illegality Notice). Thereafter, until each affected Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to
such determination no longer exist, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make SOFR Loans, and any obligation of such Lender to convert any Loan to a SOFR Loan or continue any Loan as a SOFR Loan, shall be suspended and (ii) if necessary to
avoid such illegality, the Administrative Agent shall compute the Alternate Base Rate without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Alternate Base Rate. Upon receipt of an Illegality Notice, the Borrower shall, if necessary
to avoid such illegality, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or convert all SOFR Loans to Alternate Base Rate Loans (in each case, if necessary to avoid such illegality, the Administrative Agent shall
compute the Alternate Base Rate without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Alternate Base Rate), on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such affected Lenders may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans
to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with
any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.04. 
  63 




(c) Benchmark Replacement Setting. 
(i) Benchmark Replacement. 
(A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark
Transition Event, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the then-current Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00
p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all affected Lenders and the Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not
received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 3.07(c)(i)(A) will
occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.  (ii) Benchmark Replacement Conforming
Changes. In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
(iii) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the
Borrower and the Lenders of (A) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, (B) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (C) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use, administration, adoption
or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, (D) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 3.07(c)(iv) below and (E) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark
Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 3.07(c), including any determination
with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be
conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this
Section 3.07(c). 
  64 




(iv) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (A) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and
either (1) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (2) the regulatory
supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the
definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (B) if a
tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (A) above either (1) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (2) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement
that it is not or will not be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark
settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.  (v) Benchmark Unavailability
Period. Upon the Borrowers receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, (A) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans to be made,
converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to Alternate Base Rate Loans and (B) any
outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted to Alternate Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is
not an Available Tenor, the component of the Alternate Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Alternate Base Rate. 
Section 3.08 Survival. All of the Borrowers obligations under this Article 3 shall
survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and resignation of the Administrative Agent. 
ARTICLE 4

reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect pursuant to clause (a) of the definition thereof; (ii) the present value of the unfunded liabilities to provide the accrued benefits under all Foreign Pension Plans in the

ARTICLE 8 
ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES 
Section 8.01 Acceleration, Etc.. If any Default described in
Section 7.05 or 7.06 occurs, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and the obligations of the Issuing Lenders to issue Letters of Credit hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations of the
Borrower shall immediately become due and payable, and the obligation of the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations as required in clause (ii) below shall automatically become effective, in each case without any election or
action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Issuing Lender. If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) may (i) terminate or suspend (in whole or
in part) the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and the Issuing Lenders to issue Letters of Credit hereunder and declare the Obligations of the Borrower to be due and payable (in whole or in part), whereupon such Obligations shall become
immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives and (ii) require that the Borrower Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an amount equal to 100% of
the outstanding L/C Obligations. Promptly upon any acceleration of the Obligations, the Administrative Agent will provide the Borrower with notice of such acceleration. 
If, within thirty (30) days after acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations of the Borrower or termination of the obligations of
the Lenders to make Loans and the obligations of the Issuing Lenders to issue Letters of Credit hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described in Section 7.05 or 7.06) and before any
judgment or decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or entered, the Required Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such
acceleration and/or termination.  Section 8.02 Amendments. Subject to the provisions of this
Article 8, Section 2.14, Section 2.22 and Section 3.07 and except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent in writing
of the Required Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into (with notice to the Administrative Agent, if the Administrative Agent is not acting with the consent in writing of the Required Lenders) 
  80 





agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or
thereunder or waiving any Default hereunder or thereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall:  (a)
Extend the final maturity of any Loan of any Lender (other than as expressly permitted by the terms of Section 2.23) or reduce or forgive all or any portion of the principal amount thereof payable to any Lender or of any
unpaid obligations of the Borrower under Section 2.03(f) to reimburse an Issuing Lender the amount of each draft under a Letter of Credit paid by such Issuing Lender, or reduce the rate, reduce the amount or extend the scheduled time of payment
of interest or fees thereon (other than a waiver of the application of the default rate of interest pursuant to Section 2.11 hereof) payable to any Lender, without the consent of each Lender or Issuing Lender affected
thereby.  (b) Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders or any other percentage of Lenders specified to be the
applicable percentage in this Agreement to act on specified matters or amend Section 2.19 or the definition of Pro Rata Share, without the consent of all Lenders affected thereby. For the sake of clarity, the
addition of a term loan or an increased or additional revolving credit facility or an extension of the maturity of a portion of the revolving credit facility (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 2.23) and
similar modifications shall be permitted with the consent of the Required Lenders and the Lenders agreeing to participate in the new facility or to increase the amount of their commitment or extend the maturity of their Loans. 
(c) Extend the Facility Termination Date as it applies to any Lender or otherwise extend the term or increase the amount of the Commitment of
any Lender hereunder (other than as expressly permitted by the terms of Section 2.23, Section 2.22, and the definition of Facility Termination Date) without the consent of each Lender
affected thereby.  (d) Permit the Borrower to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement except as provided in
Section 6.09 without the consent of all Lenders.  (e) Amend this Section 8.02 without
the consent of all Lenders.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (w) no amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to any Agent shall be
effective without the written consent of such Agent; (x) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (y) any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency (including, without limitation, amendments, supplements or waivers to any of documents executed by the Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement if such amendment, supplement or waiver
is delivered in order to cause such related documents to be consistent with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents); and (z) no amendment, waiver or consent shall affect the rights or duties of any Issuing Lender under this Agreement or
any Loan Document relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by it without the prior written consent of such Issuing Lender. 
  81 




Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right
to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (it being specifically understood and agreed that any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected
with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (A) the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased without the consent of such Lender and (B) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the
consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender. 
Section 8.03 Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or any Issuing Lender or
Agents to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the making of a Loan or issuance of any Letter of Credit notwithstanding the existence of a
Default or Unmatured Default or the inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan or issuance of Letter of Credit shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall
not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by, or by
the Administrative Agent with the consent of, the requisite number of Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.02, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan
Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Agents and the Lenders until all of the Obligations have been paid in full. 
ARTICLE 9  GENERAL
PROVISIONS  Section 9.01 Survival of Representations. All representations and
warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties
have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Lender regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent, any Lender and any Issuing Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the
Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Advance, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan, (except as may be Cash Collateralized or as otherwise
agreed by the applicable Issuing Lender) L/C Obligation or any other Obligation hereunder (other than any contingent indemnification obligations for which no claim has been made) shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied. 
Section 9.02 Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to the Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any applicable statute or regulation. 
  82 




Section 9.03 Headings. Section headings in the Loan
Documents are for convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of the provisions of the Loan Documents. 
Section 9.04 Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents, together with the Fee Letters, embody the entire
agreement and understanding among the Borrower, the Agents, the Lenders party thereto and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders, as applicable, relating to the subject matter thereof. 
Section 9.05 Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The respective obligations of the
Lenders and the Issuing Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender or Issuing Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the Agents are authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender or
Issuing Lender to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender or Issuing Lender from any of its obligations hereunder. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in Section 12.01(d) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each
of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement; provided, however, that the parties hereto expressly agree that each Arranger shall enjoy the benefits of the provisions
of Sections 9.06, 9.09 and 10.07 to the extent specifically set forth therein and shall have the right to enforce such provisions on its own behalf and in its own name to the same extent as if it were a party to this
Agreement.  Section 9.06 Expenses; Indemnification. 
(a) Costs and Expenses. The Borrower shall reimburse from time to time on demand (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by, without duplication, the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and their respective Affiliates (in the case of fees, disbursements
and other charges of counsel, limited to the reasonable and documented fees, disbursements and other charges of one counsel to the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers and the Lenders (taken together) and, if reasonably necessary, of one local
counsel in any relevant jurisdiction) incurred in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or
any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof and (ii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders (in the case of fees, disbursements and charges of counsel, limited to the reasonable and documented fees, disbursements and other charges of one counsel to such parties, taken together (and,
if reasonably necessary, of one local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction and, solely in the case of an actual or potential conflict of interest, of one additional counsel (and, if reasonably necessary, one additional local

  83 





counsel in any relevant jurisdiction) for all affected parties, taken together)) in connection with the enforcement or protection of their rights (A) in connection with this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, including their rights under this Section 9.06, or (B) in connection with the Loans or Letters of Credit made or issued hereunder, including all such reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or the Borrowers obligations in respect of Letters of Credit.
 (b) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any
sub-agent thereof), each Arranger, each Lender, each Issuing Lender and each of their respective Affiliates, controlling Persons, successors and assigns and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents and advisors (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from (and will reimburse each Indemnitee as the same are incurred for), any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and expenses (in the case of fees, disbursements and charges of counsel, limited to the reasonable and documented fees, disbursements and other charges of one counsel to all Indemnitees, taken together (and, if reasonably necessary, of one local
counsel in any relevant jurisdiction and, solely in the case of an actual or potential conflict of interest, of one additional counsel (and, if reasonably necessary, one additional local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction) for all affected
Indemnitees, taken together)) that may be incurred by or awarded against any Indemnitee, in each case arising out of or in connection with (i) the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the
case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including in respect of any matters addressed in
Section 3.05), (iii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds, (iv) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on, at, to or from any property currently or formerly
owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or (v) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not,
as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (x) the bad faith,
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or its Subject Related Parties, (y) a material breach by such Indemnitee or any of its Subject Related Parties of such Indemnitees obligations hereunder or under any other Loan
Document or (z) a dispute solely among two or more Indemnitees not arising from any act or omission of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries hereunder (other than claims against an Indemnitee in its capacity or as a result of fulfilling its role as
an Agent, Arranger or similar role under any of the Loan Documents). This Section 9.06(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim. In the case of an investigation, litigation or proceeding to which the indemnity in this 
  84 





Section 9.06(b) applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Borrower, its equityholders or
creditors or any other third party or an Indemnitee, whether or not an Indemnitee is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. 
(c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under
subsection (a) of this Section 9.06 or the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay or cause to be paid any amount required under subsection (b) of this Section 9.06, in each
case, to be paid to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), any Arranger, any Issuing Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent (or any such sub-agent), such Arranger, such Issuing Lender or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed
expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative
Agent (or any such sub-agent), such Arranger or such Issuing Lender in its capacity as such or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), such Arranger or such Issuing Lender in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of
Section 2.17(c).  (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Limitation of Liability. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, each party hereto agrees that it shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any other party hereto, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct
or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or
the use of the proceeds thereof (it being agreed that the Borrowers indemnity and contribution obligations set forth in this Section 9.06 shall apply in respect of any special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages that may be awarded against any Indemnitee in connection with a claim by a third party unaffiliated with the Indemnitee). None of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Arranger,
each Lender, each Issuing Lender and each of their respective Affiliates, controlling Persons, successors and assigns and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each such Person being called a Protected
Party) shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such Protected Party through telecommunications, electronic or other
information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of such Protected Party or its Subject Related Parties or a material breach of such Protected Partys or its Subject Related Parties obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, in each case, as determined by a final
and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
  85 




(e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section 9.06 shall
be payable not later than ten (10) Business Days after written demand therefor.  (f) Survival. The agreements in this
Section 9.06 shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitment and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.
 Section 9.07 Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all accounting terms used
herein shall be interpreted and all accounting determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with the Agreement Accounting Principles. 
Section 9.08 Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document that is held to be
inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the operation, enforceability, or validity of
that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.08, if and to the extent that the
enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the
extent not so limited.  Section 9.09 Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the
Borrower on the one hand and the Lenders and the Agents on the other hand shall be solely that of borrower and lender. None of the Agents, the Arrangers or any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower. None of the Agents, the
Arrangers or any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrowers business or operations. 
Section 9.10 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, each other Agent, the Issuing Lenders
and the Lenders agrees to use all Information received by them solely for the purposes of providing the services that are the subject of this Agreement and to maintain the confidentiality of the Information, except that Information may be disclosed
(a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates respective partners, directors, officers, employees, trustees, advisors and agents (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the
confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority (including any self-regulatory authority), in which case such Administrative Agent, other Agent,
Issuing Lender or Lender, as applicable, agrees to the extent reasonably practicable and not prohibited by applicable law, rule, regulation or order, to inform the Borrower promptly of the disclosure thereof, (c) to the extent required by
applicable laws, rules or regulations or by any subpoena or order or similar legal process (in which case such Administrative Agent, other Agent, Issuing Lender or Lender, as applicable, agrees to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, rule,
regulation or order, to inform the Borrower promptly of the disclosure thereof), (d) in connection with performing the services set forth herein and consummating the transactions contemplated 
  86 





hereby, to any prospective Lender or Issuing Lender or participant subject to the such prospective Lender or Issuing Lender or participant agreeing to confidentiality arrangements (for the
benefit of the Borrower) no less favorable to the Borrower than those set forth in this Section 9.10, (e) to potential counterparties to any swap or derivative transaction, subject to the confidentiality agreements in favor of the Borrower no
less favorable to the Borrower than this paragraph, (f) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (g) with the prior
written consent of the Borrower, (h) in connection with obtaining CUSIP numbers, (i) as and to the extent set forth in Section 12.02, (j) to the extent such Information (x) is or becomes publicly available other than as a

representatives) that is not, such Persons knowledge, subject to confidentiality or fiduciary obligations owing to the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Subsidiaries, (k) to any other party hereto and (l) to any rating agency on
a confidential basis in connection with rating the Borrower or the credit facility evidenced by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to provide notice of any Lender by any governmental agency
or examiner or regulatory body with jurisdiction over any Lender.  In addition, on a confidential basis, the Administrative Agent, each
Issuing Lender and each Lender may disclose the existence and terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Aggregate Commitment, the nature of the facility as a revolving credit facility, the use of proceeds provisions herein and the
principal amount outstanding at a given time), and the identity of the parties hereto (including titles and participants) to market data collectors, similar services providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
For purposes of this Section 9.10, Information means all information received from the Borrower
or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. 
Each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public
information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable law, including United States Federal and state securities laws. 
Section 9.11 Nonreliance. Each of the Lenders hereby represents that it is not relying on or looking
to any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U) as collateral in the extension or maintenance of the credit provided for herein. 
Section 9.12 Disclosure. The Borrower, the Issuing Lenders and each Lender hereby acknowledge and

relationships with the Borrower and its Affiliates. 
  87 




ARTICLE 10 
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 
Section 10.01 Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders and each Issuing Lender hereby irrevocably
appoints Wells Fargo to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article 10 (other than Section 10.06 below) are solely for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions (other than as provided in Section 10.06 below). It is
understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)
obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
Section 10.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or
unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial
advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account
therefor to the Lenders.  Section 10.03 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall
be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or
other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have
been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan or the issuance, extension, renewal, amendment or increase of a Letter of Credit
that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuing Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance, extension, renewal, amendment or increase of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be
counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
  88 




Section 10.04 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: 
(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; 
(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for
herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any
Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting
Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and  (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents,
have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its
Affiliates in any capacity.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not
taken by the Administrative Agent (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be
necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Article 8) or (ii) in the absence of (A) its and its Subject Related Parties gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a
final and non-appealable judgment and (B) material breach by the Administrative Agent and its Subject Related Parties of the Administrative Agents obligations pursuant to the terms of the Loan
Documents as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and non-appealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice
describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender. 
  89 




Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be responsible for or
have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered
hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith (including any report provided to it by an Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.03), (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or
other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document,
(v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent, or (vi) the utilization of any Issuing
Lenders L/C Commitment (it being understood and agreed that each Issuing Lender shall monitor compliance with its own L/C Commitment without any further action by the Administrative Agent). 
Section 10.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and
exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article 10 shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of
the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the
extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct (or breached its material
obligations under the Loan Documents) in the selection of such sub-agents. 
Section 10.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent. 
(a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt
of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, subject to, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a
successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (such date, or the date, if earlier, upon which a successor is
appointed, the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the
qualifications set forth above, subject to, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation
shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. 
  90 




(b) If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to
clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, subject to, so long as no
Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted
such appointment within thirty days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Removal Effective Date), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal
Effective Date.  (c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (i) the retiring
or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (ii) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Administrative
Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and each Issuing Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders
appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired or removed) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 3.08 and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or
removed Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other
Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the
Borrower and such successor. After the retiring or removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article 10 and Section 9.06 shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
(i) while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent and (ii) after such resignation or removal for as long as any of them continues to act in any agency capacity hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents, including in respect of any actions taken in connection with transferring the agency to any successor Administrative Agent. 
Section 10.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.
Each of the Lenders and each Issuing Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Arranger or any other Lender or Issuing Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each of the Lenders and each Issuing Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent, any Arranger or any other Lender or Issuing Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not
taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
  91 




Section 10.08 No Other Duties, Etc.. Anything herein
to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Arrangers or other Agents listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable,
as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Lender hereunder.  Section 10.09 Administrative Agent May
File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation
shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated), by intervention in
such proceeding or otherwise:  (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in
respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Administrative Agent
(including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the Issuing
Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09, 3.07(b) and 9.06) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 
(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender and each Issuing Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, to pay to the
Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09,
3.07(b) and 9.06.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to
or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or Issuing Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or Issuing Lender to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in
respect of the claim of any Lender or Issuing Lender in any such proceeding.

of, the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers and their respective Affiliates, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower, that at least one of the following is and will be true: 
(i) such Lender is not using plan assets (within the meaning of 29 CFR §
2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) of one or more Benefit Plans in connection with the Loans, the Letters of Credit or the Commitments,

(iii) (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a Qualified Professional Asset Manager (within the meaning

  93 





Agent, any Arranger or any of their respective Affiliates is a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lenders entrance into, participation in, administration
of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents
related hereto or thereto).  Section 10.11 Erroneous Payments. 
(a) Each Lender, each Issuing Lender and any other party hereto other than the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (if applicable) hereby severally
agrees that if (i) the Administrative Agent notifies (which such notice shall be conclusive absent manifest error) such Lender or Issuing Lender or any other Person other than the Borrower and its Subsidiaries that has received funds from
the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates, either for its own account or on behalf of a Lender or Issuing Lender (each such recipient, a Payment Recipient) that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole
discretion that any funds received by such Payment Recipient were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Payment Recipient) or (ii) any Payment
Recipient receives any payment from the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the
Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, as applicable, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or
any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, as applicable, or (z) that such Payment Recipient otherwise becomes aware was transmitted or received in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) then, in each case,
an error in payment shall be presumed to have been made (any such amounts specified in clauses (i) or (ii) of this Section 10.11(a), whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees,
distribution or otherwise; individually and collectively, an Erroneous Payment), then, in each case, such Payment Recipient is deemed to have knowledge of such error at the time of its receipt of such Erroneous Payment;
provided that nothing in this Section shall require the Administrative Agent to provide any of the notices specified in clauses (i) or (ii) above. Each Payment Recipient agrees that it shall not assert any right or claim to any Erroneous
Payment, and hereby waives any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous
Payments, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine.  (b)
Without limiting the immediately preceding clause (a), each Payment Recipient agrees that, in the case of clause (a)(ii) above, it shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent in writing of such occurrence. 
  94 




(c) In the case of either clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, such Erroneous Payment shall at
all times remain the property of the Administrative Agent and shall be segregated by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, and upon demand from the Administrative Agent such Payment Recipient shall (or,
shall cause any Person who received any portion of an Erroneous Payment on its behalf to), promptly, but in all events no later than one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion
thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds and in the currency so received, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Payment
Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time
in effect.  (d) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Administrative Agent for any reason,
after demand therefor by the Administrative Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (c), from any Lender that is a Payment Recipient or an Affiliate of a Payment Recipient (such unrecovered amount as to such Lender, an
Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency), then at the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and upon the Administrative Agents written notice to such Lender (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have made a cashless
assignment of the full face amount of the portion of its Loans (but not its Commitments) of the relevant Class with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the Erroneous Payment Impacted Class) to the Administrative
Agent or, at the option of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agents applicable lending affiliate in an amount that is equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may specify)
(such assignment of the Loans (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Class, the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment) plus any accrued and unpaid interest on such assigned amount, without further consent or
approval of any party hereto and without any payment by the Administrative Agent or its applicable lending affiliate as the assignee of such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (1) any
assignment contemplated in this clause (d) shall be made without any requirement for any payment or other consideration paid by the applicable assignee or received by the assignor, (2) the provisions of this clause (d) shall govern in
the event of any conflict with the terms and conditions of Section 12.01 and (3) the Administrative Agent may reflect such assignments in the Register without further consent or action by any other Person. 
(e) Each party hereto hereby agrees that (x) in the event an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered from any Payment
Recipient that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent (1) shall be subrogated to all the rights of such Payment Recipient with respect to such amount and (2) is authorized to set
off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Payment Recipient under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent to such Payment Recipient from any source, against any amount due to the
Administrative Agent under this Section 10.11 or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement, (y) the receipt of an Erroneous Payment by a Payment Recipient shall not for the purpose of this Agreement be
treated as a payment, prepayment, repayment, discharge or other satisfaction of any Obligations owed by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of
such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received 
  95 





by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries for the purpose of making a payment on the Obligations and (z) to the extent that an Erroneous Payment (except to the
extent such Erroneous Payment was, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that was, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries for the purpose of making a payment on
the Obligations) was in any way or at any time credited as payment or satisfaction of any of the Obligations, the Obligations or any part thereof that were so credited, and all rights of the Payment Recipient, as the case may be, shall be reinstated
and continue in full force and effect as if such payment or satisfaction had never been received.  (f) Each partys obligations under
this Section 10.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments or the repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.  (g) Nothing in this
Section 10.11 will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of the Administrative Agent hereunder arising from any Payment Recipients receipt of an Erroneous Payment. 
ARTICLE 11  SETOFF
 Section 11.01 Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the
Lenders or any Issuing Lender under applicable law, if any Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or
owing by any Lender or any Issuing Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender or Issuing Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations of the Borrower then owing to such Lender or
Issuing Lender to the extent the Obligations shall then be due; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the
Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.21 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it
exercised such right of setoff. 
  96 




ARTICLE 12 
BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS 
Section 12.01 Successors and Assigns. 
(a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and thereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder or thereunder without the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this
Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this
Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).  (b) Assignments by Lenders.
Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this
subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations) at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(i) Minimum Amounts. 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment and the Loans at the
time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
(B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this
purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and
Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $25,000,000 unless each of the
Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default under Section 7.02, 7.05 or 7.06 has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group)
will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met.  (ii)
Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned. 
  97 




(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any
assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:  (A) the prior written
consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless such assignment is to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or a Default under Section 7.02,
Section 7.05 or Section 7.06 has occurred and is continuing; provided that no assignment shall result in any Lender, together with its Affiliates, holding more than 30% of the Aggregate Commitments
at any time without the prior written consent of the Borrower unless a Default under Section 7.02, Section 7.05 or Section 7.06 has occurred and is continuing; 
(B) the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be
required if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender; and 
(C) the consent of the Issuing Lenders (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any
assignment.  (iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation
fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire. 
(v) No Assignment to Borrower. No such assignment shall be made to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries.  (vi) No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural person. 
(vii) No Assignment to Defaulting Lenders. No such assignment shall be made to a Defaulting Lender. 
(viii) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender
hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount
sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent, the Pro Rata Share of Revolving Loans previously requested but not funded by the 
  98 





Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting
Lender to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full Pro Rata Share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of
such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.  Subject to
acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party
hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 3.07(b) and 9.06 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Upon request, the
Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section. 
(c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent
of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments and L/C Commitments
of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender and Issuing Lender, as applicable, pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender or Issuing Lender, as applicable, hereunder
for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting
Lender. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In addition, at any time that a request for a consent for a material or substantive change to the Loan
Documents is pending, any Lender may request and receive from the Administrative Agent a copy of the Register. 
  99 




(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the prior written consent of
the Borrower, Administrative Agent or any Issuing Lender, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or
a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lenders participations in L/C Obligations)); provided that (i) such
Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right
to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the proviso to Section 8.02 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 or 3.07(b) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.01 as though it were a Lender, provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.19 as
though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a nonfiduciary agent of the
Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other Obligations under the Loan Documents (the
Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a
Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other Obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other Obligation is in registered
form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative
Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant
shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 or 3.07(b) than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to
such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.05 unless such Participant
agrees to comply with Section 3.05 as though it were a Lender (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.05(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the
participation). 
  100 




(f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central banking authority
having jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
Section 12.02 Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each of the Lenders to disclose to any
Participant and any prospective Participant any and all information in such Lenders possession concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including without limitation any information contained in any reports or other
information delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01; provided that each Participant and prospective Participant agrees to be bound by Section 9.10 of this Agreement or other
provisions at least as restrictive as Section 9.10 including making the acknowledgments set forth therein (in each case for the benefit of the Borrower). 
Section 12.03 Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to any Participant which is
organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such Participant, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the provisions of
Section 3.05(e).  ARTICLE 13 
NOTICES 
Section 13.01 Notices; Effectiveness; Electronic Communication. 
(a) Notices Generally. Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone (and except
as provided in subsection (b) below), all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by telecopier as
follows, and all notices and other communications expressly permitted hereunder to be given by telephone shall be made to the applicable telephone number, as follows: 
(i) if to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to the address, telecopier number, electronic mail address or telephone
number set forth on Schedule 13.01; and  (ii) if to any other Lender or Issuing Lender, to the address, telecopier number,
electronic mail address or telephone number specified in its administrative questionnaire. 
  101 




Notices and other communications sent by hand or overnight courier service, or mailed by certified or
registered mail, shall be deemed to have been given when received; notices and other communications sent by telecopier shall be deemed to have been given when sent (except that, if not given during normal business hours for the recipient, shall be
deemed to have been given at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient). Notices and other communications delivered through electronic communications to the extent provided in paragraph (b) below, shall be effective as
provided in said paragraph (b).  (b) Electronic Communications(c) . Notices and other communications to the Lenders and Issuing
Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent or as otherwise
determined by the Administrative Agent, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender or Issuing Lender pursuant to Article 2 if such Lender or Issuing Lender has notified the Administrative Agent that it is
incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent, the Borrower or any Issuing Lender may, in its respective discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by
electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it or as it otherwise determines, provided that such determination or approval may be limited to particular notices or communications. 
Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an
e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the senders receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the return receipt requested function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), provided that if such notice or other communication is not given during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to
have been given at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at
its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor. 
(c) The Platform. THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE. THE AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT
WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY,
INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH
THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender, any Issuing Lender or any other
Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether 
  102 





in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agents transmission of Borrower Materials through the Internet, except to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or breach of its material obligations
under any Loan Document by, such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender, any Issuing Lender or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or
punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages).  (d) Change of Address, Etc. Each of the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and each Issuing Lender may change its address, telecopier or telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by written notice to the other parties hereto. Each other Lender may change its address, telecopier or telephone
number for notices and other communications hereunder by written notice to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender. In addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time to ensure that the
Administrative Agent has on record (i) an effective address, contact name, telephone number, telecopier number and electronic mail address to which notices and other communications may be sent and (ii) accurate wire instructions for such
Lender. Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the Private Side Information or similar designation on the content declaration screen of
the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lenders compliance procedures and applicable law, including United States Federal and state securities laws, to make reference to Borrower
Materials that are not made available through the Public Side Information portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities
for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws.  (e) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower so long as such notices appear on their face to be authentic even if (i) such notices
were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The
Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender, each Issuing Lender and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given
by or on behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.

ARTICLE 14 
COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS; ELECTRONIC EXECUTION 
Section 14.01 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different
parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Except as provided in Article 4, this Agreement shall become effective when it
shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or email shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart
of this Agreement.  Section 14.02 Electronic Execution. The words delivery,
execute, execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in or related to any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without
limitation Assignment and Assumptions, amendments or other modifications, Conversion/Continuation Notices, Borrowing Notices, waivers and consents) (each, a Communication) shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, the
electronic matching of assignment terms and contract formations on electronic platforms approved by the Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability
as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and
National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. For the avoidance of doubt, the authorization under this Section 14.02 may
include, without limitation, use or acceptance by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders of a manually signed paper Communication which has been converted into electronic form (such as scanned into PDF format), or an
electronically signed Communication converted into another format approved by the Administrative Agent, for transmission, delivery and/or retention. The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders may, at its option, create one or
more copies of any Communication in the form of an imaged Electronic Record, which shall be deemed created in the ordinary course of such Persons business, and destroy the original paper document. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to agree to accept electronic signatures in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided, without
limiting the foregoing, (a) to the extent the Administrative Agent has agreed to accept such Electronic Signature, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on any such Electronic Signature purportedly given by
or on behalf of the Borrower without further verification and (b) upon the reasonable request of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart. For purposes
hereof, Electronic Record and Electronic Signature shall have the meanings assigned to them, respectively, by 15 USC §7006, as it may be amended from time to time.

requirements of the U.S. Patriot Act and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name, address and tax forms of the Borrower and other
information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the U.S. Patriot Act and Beneficial Ownership Regulation. The Borrower shall, promptly following a request by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all documentation and other information that the Administrative Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable know your customer and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S. Patriot Act and Beneficial Ownership Regulation. 
Section 15.05 No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all aspects of each transaction

Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) each of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders is

Person and (B) neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arrangers nor any of the Lenders has any obligation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set
forth herein and in the other 
  106 





Loan Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that
differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arrangers nor any of the Lenders has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or its Affiliates. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, the Borrower hereby agrees and covenants that it will not make any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in
connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.  Section 15.06 [Reserved].

by:  (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising

  107 




ARTICLE 16 
GUARANTEE 
Section 16.01 Guarantors(i) . Any time after the Effective Date, the Borrower may cause any Subsidiary of the
Borrower to guarantee the Obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Documents by delivering to the Administrative Agent customary joinder documentation reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, and pursuant to which such Person shall
become a Guarantor for all purposes under this Agreement and each other Loan Document and shall be bound by all of the obligations of and shall have all of the rights of a Guarantor under this Agreement and each other Loan
Document including, without limitation, providing the guarantee of the Guaranteed Obligations as set forth in this Article 16. 
Section 16.02 Guarantee(i) . Upon becoming a Guarantor pursuant to Section 16.01,
each Guarantor, on a joint and several basis, unconditionally guarantees (the undertaking of each Guarantor contained in this Article 16 being a Guarantee) the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under the Loan Documents, whether for principal, interest, fees, expenses or otherwise (such obligations, collectively, being the Guaranteed
Obligations). Each Guarantee is a guaranty of payment and not of collection. Upon becoming a Guarantor pursuant to Section 16.01 each Guarantor agrees that, as between each Guarantor and the Administrative Agent,
the Guaranteed Obligations may be declared to be due and payable for purposes of its Guarantee notwithstanding any stay (including any stay imposed by the commencement by or against the Borrower of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws naming
the Borrower as the debtor in such proceeding), injunction or other prohibition which may prevent, delay or vitiate any declaration as regards the Borrower and that in the event of a declaration or attempted declaration, the Guaranteed Obligations
shall immediately become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of its Guarantee. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder at any time shall, without further action by any
Guarantor or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render such Guarantors obligations hereunder invalid and unenforceable or otherwise subject to avoidance as a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any similar federal or state law (including the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act) or
subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such proceeding.  Section 16.03 Guaranty
Absolute. Upon becoming a Guarantor pursuant to Section 16.01, each Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or
hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders or the Lenders with respect thereto. The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee shall be absolute and
unconditional irrespective of:  (a) any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any Loan Document, any
Guaranteed Obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;  (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of,
or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement; 
  108 




(c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any
collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations; 
(d) any law or regulation of any jurisdiction or any other event affecting any term of a Guaranteed Obligation; or 
(e) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Guarantor or the Borrower. 
Each Guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. 
Section 16.04 Waivers . 
(a) Upon becoming a Guarantor pursuant to Section 16.01, each Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of
acceptance and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and its Guarantee and any requirement that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien
or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Borrower or any other Person or any collateral.  (b)
Upon becoming a Guarantor pursuant to Section 16.01, each Guarantor irrevocably waives any claims or other rights that it may now or hereafter acquire against the Borrower that arise from the existence, payment, performance
or enforcement of the obligations of any Guarantor under its Guarantee, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender against the Borrower or any collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or
receive from the Borrower, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right. If any amount shall be paid to
any Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence at any time prior to the later of the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under such Guarantors Guarantee and the Facility Termination Date, such
amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts
payable under such Guarantors Guarantee, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such Guarantors Guarantee, or to be held as collateral for any Guaranteed Obligations or other amounts payable
under the Guarantee thereafter arising. Upon becoming a Guarantor pursuant to Section 16.01, each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by this
Agreement and its Guarantee and that the waiver set forth in this Section 16.04(b) is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. 
  109 




Section 16.05 Continuing Guaranty. Each Guarantee is a
continuing guaranty and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations (including any and all Guaranteed Obligations which remain outstanding after the Facility Termination Date) and all other
amounts payable under its Guarantee, (ii) be binding upon each Guarantor and its successors and assigns, and (iii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders, the Administrative Agent and their
respective successors, transferees and assigns.  Section 16.06 Release of Guarantors. 
(a) If (i) in compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, any Guarantor ceases to constitute a Subsidiary of the Borrower
or (ii) after giving effect to the release of any Guarantor, there is no Default under this Agreement, then such Guarantor shall, in the discretion of the Borrower upon notice in writing to the Administrative Agent, automatically be released
from its obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including the Guarantee set forth in this Article 16, and thereafter such Person shall no longer constitute a Guarantor under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents. 
(b) At the request of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall, at the Borrowers expense, execute such documents as are reasonably
necessary to acknowledge any such release in accordance with this Section 16.06, so long as the Borrower shall have provided the Administrative Agent a certificate, signed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower,
certifying as to satisfaction of one of the requirements set forth in clause (a) above.  [Signature Pages Follow]
