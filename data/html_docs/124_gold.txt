procedures apply to Borrowings other than Swing Line Borrowings (see Section 2.4) and drawings under an LC (see Section 2.3): 
(a) Borrower may request a Borrowing by submitting to Administrative Agent a Borrowing Request. The Borrowing Request must be
received by Administrative Agent no later than (i) 12:00 noon on the third Business Day preceding the Borrowing Date for any LIBOR Rate Borrowing or (ii) 11:00 a.m. on the Borrowing Date for any ABR Borrowing. Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of any Borrowing Request and its contents. A Borrowing Request is irrevocable and binding on Borrower. 
(b) By 2:00 p.m. on the applicable Borrowing Date, each Lender shall remit its Pro Rata Part of each requested Borrowing by
wire transfer to Administrative Agent pursuant to Administrative Agents wire transfer instructions on Schedule 1 (or as otherwise directed by Administrative Agent) in funds that are available for immediate use by Administrative
Agent. Subject to receipt of such funds, Administrative Agent shall make such funds available to Borrower as directed in the Borrowing Request (unless Administrative Agent has actual knowledge that any applicable condition precedent has not been
satisfied by Borrower and has not been waived by Majority Lenders).  (c) Absent contrary written notice from a Lender,
Administrative Agent may assume that each Lender has made its Pro Rata Part of the requested Borrowing available to Administrative Agent on the applicable Borrowing Date, and Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption (but is not
required to), make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. If a Lender fails to make its Pro Rata Part of any requested Borrowing available to Administrative Agent on the applicable Borrowing Date, Administrative Agent may recover the
applicable amount on demand (i) from that Lender, together with interest at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for the period commencing on the date the amount was made available to Borrower by Administrative Agent and ending on (but excluding)
the date Administrative Agent recovers the amount from that Lender or (ii) if that Lender fails to pay its amount upon demand, then from Borrower, together with interest at an annual interest rate equal to the rate applicable to the requested
Borrowing for the period commencing on the Borrowing Date and ending on (but excluding) the date Administrative Agent recovers the amount from Borrower. No Lender is responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make its Pro Rata Part of any
Borrowing. 
  20 


2.3 LC Subfacility. 
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and applicable Law, Administrative Agent agrees to issue LCs under
the Facility upon Borrowers delivery of an LC Request and a duly executed LC Agreement, each of which must be received by Administrative Agent no later than 12:00 noon on the third Business Day before the requested LC is to be issued; provided
that the LC Exposure may not exceed $80,000,000 and the Facility Commitment Usage may not exceed the Facility Commitment Sum. Each LC must expire no later than the earlier (i) of five (5) days before the Facility Maturity Date and
(ii) one (1) year after such LCs issuance (provided that, LCs may, if so requested by Borrower, be self-extending for up to one additional year with up to one hundred twenty (120) days cancellation notice, but in no event shall the
expiration extend beyond the date contemplated by Section 2.3(a)(i)).  (b) Immediately upon
Administrative Agents issuance of any LC, Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each other Lender, and each other Lender shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from
Administrative Agent, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation (to the extent of such Lenders Pro Rata Part of the Facility Commitment Sum) in the LC and all applicable Rights of Administrative Agent in the LC
(other than Rights to receive certain fees provided for in Section 4.2). Administrative Agent agrees to provide a copy of each LC to each other Lender promptly after issuance. However, Administrative Agents failure to
promptly send to Lenders a copy of an issued LC shall not affect the rights and obligations of Administrative Agent and Lenders under this Agreement. 
(c) To induce Administrative Agent to issue and maintain LCs, and to induce Lenders to participate in issued LCs, Borrower
agrees to pay or reimburse Administrative Agent (i) within one (1) Business Day after Borrower receives notice from Administrative Agent that any draft or draw request has been properly presented under any LC, or, if the draft or draw
request is for payment at a future date, within one (1) Business Day before the payment date specified in the draw request, the amount paid or to be paid by Administrative Agent and (ii) promptly, upon demand, the amount of any additional
fees Administrative Agent customarily charges for the application and issuance of an LC, for confirming, negotiating or amending LC Agreements, for honoring drafts and draw requests, and taking similar action in connection with letters of credit. If
Borrower does not timely pay or reimburse Administrative Agent for any drafts or draw requests paid or to be paid, Administrative Agent shall fund Borrowers reimbursement obligations as an ABR Borrowing, Pro Rata among the Lenders, under the
Facility and the proceeds of the ABR Borrowing shall be advanced directly to Administrative Agent to pay Borrowers unpaid reimbursement obligations. If funds cannot be advanced under the Facility for the immediately preceding sentence to fund
the reimbursement obligations as a Borrowing under the Facility, then Borrowers reimbursement obligation shall constitute a demand obligation. 
  21 



Borrowers reimbursement obligations shall accrue interest (x) at the ABR plus the Applicable Margin from the date Administrative Agent pays the applicable draft or draw request through
the date Administrative Agent is paid or reimbursed by Borrower and, (y) if funds are not advanced under the Facility, at the Default Rate from the date Administrative Agent pays the applicable draft or draw request through the date
Administrative Agent is paid or reimbursed by Borrower. Borrowers obligations under this Section 2.3(c) are absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense
to payment that Borrower may have at any time against Administrative Agent or any other Person. Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute reimbursement payments received from Borrower to all Lenders according to their Pro Rata Part of the
Facility Commitment Sum.  (d) Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower of the date and amount of any draft or
draw request presented for honor under any LC (but failure to give notice will not affect Borrowers obligations under this Agreement). Administrative Agent shall pay the requested amount upon presentment of a draft or draw request unless
presentment on its face does not comply with the terms of the applicable LC. When making payment, Administrative Agent may disregard (i) any default or potential default that exists under any other agreement and (ii) obligations under any
other agreement that have or have not been performed by the beneficiary or any other Person (and Administrative Agent is not liable for any of those obligations). Borrowers reimbursement obligations to Administrative Agent and Lenders, and
each Lenders obligations to Administrative Agent, under this Section 2.3 are absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and Administrative Agent is not responsible for, (1) the validity, enforceability, sufficiency,
accuracy, or genuineness of documents or endorsements (even if they are in any respect invalid, unenforceable, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent, or forged), (2) any dispute by any Company with or any Companys claims, setoffs,
defenses, counterclaims, or other Rights against Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any other Person, or (iii) the occurrence of any Potential Default or Default. 
(e) If Borrower fails to reimburse Administrative Agent as provided in Section 2.3(c) and funds are not
advanced under the Facility to satisfy the reimbursement obligations, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of Borrowers failure, of the date and amount paid, and of each Lenders Pro Rata Part of the unreimbursed amount.
Each Lender shall promptly and unconditionally make available to Administrative Agent in immediately available funds its Pro Rata Part of the unpaid reimbursement obligation. Such funds are due and payable to Administrative Agent before the close of
business on (i) the Business Day Administrative Agent gives notice to each Lender of Borrowers reimbursement failure if the notice is received by a Lender before 2:00 p.m. in the time zone where such Lenders office listed on
Schedule 1 is located, or (ii) on the next succeeding Business Day after the Business Day Administrative Agent gives notice to each Lender of Borrowers reimbursement failure, if notice is received after 2:00 p.m. in the time
zone where such Lenders office listed on Schedule 1 is located. All amounts payable by any Lender accrue interest at the Federal Funds Effective Rate from the day the applicable draft or draw is paid by Administrative Agent to
(but not including) the date the amount is paid by the Lender to Administrative Agent. 
  22 


(f) Borrower acknowledges that each LC is deemed issued upon delivery to the
beneficiary or Borrower. If Borrower requests that any LC be delivered to Borrower rather than the beneficiary, and Borrower subsequently cancels that LC, Borrower agrees to return it to Administrative Agent together with Borrowers written
certification that it has never been delivered to the beneficiary. If any LC is delivered to the beneficiary under Borrowers instructions, Borrowers cancellation is ineffective without Administrative Agents receipt of the LC and
the beneficiarys written consent to the cancellation.  (g) Administrative Agent agrees with each Lender that it will
examine all documents with reasonable care to ascertain that each appears on its face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the LC. Each Lender and Borrower agree that, in paying any draft or draw under any LC, Administrative Agent
has no responsibility to obtain any document (other than any documents expressly required by the respective LC) or to ascertain or inquire as to any documents validity, enforceability, sufficiency, accuracy, or genuineness or the authority of
any Person delivering it. Neither Administrative Agent nor its Representatives will be liable to any Lender or any Company for any LCs use or for any beneficiarys acts or omissions. Any action, inaction, error, delay, or omission taken or
suffered by Administrative Agent or any of its Representatives in connection with any LC, applicable draws, drafts, or documents, or the transmission, dispatch, or delivery of any related message or advice, if in conformity with applicable Laws and
in accordance with the standards of care specified in the UCP, is binding upon the Companies and Lenders. Administrative Agent is not liable to any Company or any Lender for any action taken or omitted by Administrative Agent or its
Representative in connection with any LC in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.  (h) On the Facility
Maturity Date, upon a termination under Section 2.5, during the continuance of a Default under Section 11.3, or upon any demand by Administrative Agent during the continuance of any other Default, Borrower shall
provide to Administrative Agent, for the benefit of Lenders, cash collateral in an amount equal to the then-existing LC Exposure. Any cash collateral provided by Borrower to Administrative Agent in accordance with this
Section 2.3(h) shall be deposited by Administrative Agent in an interest bearing cash collateral account maintained with Administrative Agent at the office of Administrative Agent and invested in obligations issued or guaranteed
by the United States and, upon the surrender of any LC, Administrative Agent shall deliver the appropriate funds on deposit in such collateral account to Borrower together with interest accrued on such funds. 
(i) BORROWER SHALL PROTECT, INDEMNIFY, PAY, AND SAVE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, EACH LENDER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES
HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES) WHICH ANY OF THEM MAY INCUR OR BE SUBJECT TO AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE ISSUANCE OF ANY LC, ANY
DISPUTE ABOUT IT, ANY CANCELLATION OF ANY LC BY BORROWER, OR THE FAILURE OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT TO HONOR A DRAFT OR DRAW REQUEST UNDER ANY LC AS A RESULT OF ANY ACT OR OMISSION (WHETHER RIGHT OR WRONG) OF ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE TRIBUNAL. HOWEVER, NO
PERSON IS ENTITLED TO INDEMNITY UNDER THE FOREGOING FOR ITS OWN GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, AS DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY FINAL AND NONAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT. THE PROVISIONS OF AND UNDERTAKINGS AND INDEMNIFICATION
SET FORTH IN THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL SURVIVE THE SATISFACTION AND PAYMENT OF THE OBLIGATION AND TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
  23 


(j) Although referenced in any LC, terms of any particular agreement or other
obligation to the beneficiary are not incorporated into this Agreement in any manner. The fees and other amounts payable with respect to each LC are as provided in this Agreement, drafts and draws under each LC are part of the Obligation, and the
terms of this Agreement control any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any LC Agreement.  2.4 Swing Line Subfacility.
 (a) For the convenience of the parties, the Administrative Agent, solely for its own account, may make any requested
Borrowing of not less than $500,000 (or a greater integral multiple of $100,000) directly to Borrower as a Swing Line Borrowing without requiring each other Lender to fund its Pro Rata Part thereof unless and until Section 2.4(c)
is applicable. Swing Line Borrowings are subject to the following conditions:  (i) Each Swing Line Borrowing must occur on
a Business Day before the Swing Line Maturity Date;  (ii) When determined, (x) the aggregate Swing Line Exposure
outstanding may not exceed $10,000,000 and (y) the Facility Commitment Usage may not exceed the Facility Committed Sum; 
(iii) On any date when Borrowings equal to or in excess of $10,000,000 are funded under the Facility, all or a portion of the
proceeds of those Borrowings shall be used to repay in full all indebtedness then outstanding under the Swing Line Subfacility; 
(iv) Each Swing Line Borrowing is deemed an ABR Borrowing; and 
(v) Each Borrowing under the Swing Line Subfacility is available and may be prepaid on same-day telephonic notice from Borrower
to Administrative Agent, if notice is received by Administrative Agent before 11:00 a.m.  (b) Each Swing Line Borrowing
shall be repaid on the earlier of (i) the date that is five Business Days after the making of such Swing Line Borrowing and (ii) the Swing Line Maturity Date. 
(c) If (i) any Swing Line Borrowing remains outstanding at 12:00 noon on the Business Day immediately prior to the
Business Day on which Swing Line Borrowings are due and payable pursuant to Section 2.4(b) and by such time Administrative Agent shall not have received a Borrowing Request from Borrower pursuant to Section 2.2
requesting an ABR Borrowing on the following Business Day in an amount at least equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Swing Line Borrowings or (ii) any Swing Line Borrowing remains 
  24 



outstanding during the existence of a Potential Default or a Default, Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have received a Borrowing Request from Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.2 requesting an ABR Borrowing on such following Business Day in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such Swing Line Borrowings; provided that such ABR Borrowing shall be made notwithstanding Borrowers
failure to comply with Section 6.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an ABR Borrowing becomes legally impractical, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of Borrowers failure to pay such Swing Line
Borrowings and the unpaid amount of such Swing Line Borrowings. No later than the close of business on the date Administrative Agent gives notice (if notice is given before 12:00 noon on any Business Day, or, if made at any other time, on the next
Business Day following the date of notice), each Lender shall irrevocably and unconditionally purchase and receive from Administrative Agent a ratable participation in such Swing Line Borrowings and shall make available to Administrative Agent in
immediately available funds its Pro Rata Part of such unpaid amount, together with interest from the date when its payment was due to, but not including, the date of payment, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. If a Lender does not promptly pay its
amount upon Administrative Agents demand, and until such Lender makes the required payment, Administrative Agent is deemed to continue to have outstanding a Swing Line Borrowing in the amount of such Lenders unpaid obligation. Borrower
shall make each payment of all or any part of any Swing Line Borrowing to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of Administrative Agent and those Lenders who have funded their participations in Swing Line Borrowings under this
Section 2.4(c) (but all interest accruing on Swing Line Borrowings before the funding date of any participation is payable solely to Administrative Agent for its own account). 
2.5 Termination. Without premium or penalty, and upon giving at least ten (10) Business Days prior written and irrevocable notice
to Administrative Agent, Borrower may terminate all or part of the unused portion of the Facility Committed Sum. Each partial termination must be in an amount of not less than $5,000,000 or a greater integral multiple of $1,000,000, and shall be Pro
Rata among all Lenders. Once terminated in full, the Facility Committed Sum may not be increased or reinstated.  2.6 Optional Increase
in Facility Committed Sum.  (a) At any time prior to the Facility Maturity Date, Borrower may, by notice to
Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify Lenders) request an increase in the Facility Committed Sum. Such notice shall set forth the requested amount of the increase in the Facility Committed Sum and the date on which such increase is to
become effective (which shall be not fewer than twenty days after the date of such notice), and shall offer each Lender the opportunity to increase its Committed Sum. Each Lender shall, by notice to Borrower and Administrative Agent given not more
than ten Business Days after the date of Borrowers notice, either agree to increase its Committed Sum or decline to increase its Committed Sum (and any Lender that does not deliver such a notice within such period of ten Business Days shall be
deemed to have declined to increase its Committed Sum). In the event that Lenders agree to increase their Committed Sums by an aggregate amount equal to or greater than the increase in the Facility Committed Sum requested by Borrower, then the
increase will be allocated among Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Parts, based on the Facility Commitment Sum on the date of Borrowers notice of the requested increase in the Facility Committed Sum.

  25 



In the event that, on the tenth Business Day after Borrower shall have delivered a notice pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph, Lenders shall have agreed pursuant to the preceding
sentence to increase their Committed Sums by an aggregate amount less than the increase in the Facility Committed Sum requested by Borrower, Borrower shall have the right to agree with one or more existing Lenders that such Lenders or
Lenders Committed Sums shall be increased, or to designate one or more financial institutions not theretofore a Lender to become a Lender (such designation to be effective only with the prior written consent of Administrative Agent, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Upon execution and delivery by the Borrower and such Lender or other financial institution of an instrument in form reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent, such existing Lender shall
have a Committed Sum as therein set forth or such other financial institution shall become a Lender with a Committed Sum as therein set forth and all the rights and obligations of a Lender with a Committed Sum hereunder; provided that: 
(i) no Potential Default or Default shall have occurred and be continuing or result therefrom; 
(ii) the aggregate amount of all increases on the Facility Committed Sum pursuant to this Section 2.6(a)
shall not exceed $100,000,000;  (iii) the Committed Sum of each such other financial institution shall be not less than
$15,000,000; and  (iv) immediately after such increase is made, the Facility Committed Sum shall not exceed $600,000,000.
 (b) Upon any increase in the Facility Committed Sum pursuant to Section 2.6(a), Lenders shall on the
effective date of such increase, at the direction of Administrative Agent, make appropriate adjustments among themselves in order to ensure that the amount (and Type) of the Borrowings outstanding to Borrower from each Lender under this Agreement
(as of the effective date of such increase) are proportionate to Lenders respective Pro Rata Part, after giving effect to any increase of the Committed Sum of any Lender and to any Committed Sum of any additional financial institution. 
SECTION 3. TERMS OF PAYMENT.  3.1
Notes and Payments.  (a) Notes. 
(i) The Principal Debt shall be evidenced by the Facility Notes, one payable to each Lender in the stated principal amount of
its Committed Sum for the Facility.  (ii) Principal Debt under the Swing Line Subfacility shall be evidenced by a Swing
Line Note payable to the Administrative Agent in the stated principal amount of $10,000,000. 
  26 


(b) Payments Generally. Borrower must make each payment and prepayment on
the Obligation, without offset, counterclaim, or deduction, to Administrative Agents principal office in Boston, Massachusetts, in funds that will be available for immediate use by Administrative Agent by 12:00 noon on the day due. Payments
received after such time shall be deemed received on the next Business Day. Administrative Agent shall pay to each Lender any payment to which that Lender is entitled on the same day Administrative Agent receives the funds from Borrower if
Administrative Agent receives the payment or prepayment before 12:00 noon, and otherwise before 12:00 noon on the following Business Day. If and to the extent that Administrative Agent does not make payments to Lenders when due, unpaid amounts shall
accrue interest at the Federal Funds Effective Rate from the due date until (but not including) the payment date.  3.2 Interest and
Principal Payments.  (a) Interest Payments. Accrued interest on each LIBOR Rate Borrowing is due and payable on
the last day of its respective Interest Period. If any Interest Period with respect to a LIBOR Rate Borrowing is a period greater than three (3) months, then accrued interest is also due and payable on the date three (3) months after the
commencement of the Interest Period. Accrued interest on each ABR Borrowing is due and payable on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year during the term hereof and on the Facility Maturity
Date.  (b) Principal Payments. The Principal Debt is due and payable on the Facility Maturity Date. 
(c) Mandatory Prepayments of Proceeds. Not later than the 5th
Business Day following the date of receipt of the applicable proceeds described below in this Section 3.2(c), the following amounts shall be applied to prepay the Principal Debt (which prepayment shall not result in a
corresponding permanent reduction of the Facility Committed Sum):  (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds of any sale or other
disposition by the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries of any assets (except for sales and other dispositions permitted under Section 9.10) in excess of $70,000,000 (excluding any sale or other disposition the net cash proceeds of
which were previously used to make a mandatory prepayment under this clause (i)) in the aggregate from the Closing Date to the date of such sale or other disposition. 
(d) Mandatory Prepayment. If (i) the Facility Commitment Usage ever exceeds the Facility Committed Sum or
(ii) Borrowers property becomes the subject of a casualty or condemnation, the net cash proceeds of which exceed $5,000,000 in the aggregate in any Fiscal Year, then Borrower shall prepay (1) the Principal Debt under the Facility in
at least the amount of the excess described in (i) above, and (2) the Principal Debt under the Facility by the amount of proceeds of casualty or condemnation described in (ii) above, together with (x) all accrued and unpaid
interest on the principal amount so prepaid and (y) any resulting Funding Loss; provided, however, that (A) Borrower shall not be required to make any prepayment required by this Section 3.2(d) until the last day of the
Interest Period with respect to such Principal Debt so long as an amount equal to such prepayment is deposited by Borrower in a cash collateral account with Administrative Agent to be held in such account on terms reasonably satisfactory to
Administrative Agent and (B) such prepayment shall not result in a corresponding permanent reduction of the Facility Committed Sum. 
  27 


(e) Voluntary Prepayment. Borrower may voluntarily repay or prepay all or
any part of the Principal Debt at any time without premium or penalty, subject to the following conditions:  (i)
Administrative Agent must receive Borrowers written payment notice by (A) 12:00 noon on the third Business Day preceding the date of payment of a LIBOR Rate Borrowing and (B) 11:00 a.m. on the date of payment of an ABR Borrowing
which shall specify the payment date, the facility or the subfacility under this Agreement being paid and the Type and amount of the Borrowing(s) to be paid, and which shall constitute an irrevocable and binding obligation of Borrower to make a
repayment or prepayment on the designated date;  (ii) each partial repayment or prepayment must be in a minimum amount of
at least $2,000,000 or a greater integral multiple of $100,000 (if a LIBOR Rate Borrowing), or $1,000,000 or a greater integral multiple of $100,000 (if an ABR Borrowing other than under the Swing Line Subfacility) or $250,000 or a greater multiple
(if a Borrowing under the Swing Line Subfacility);  (iii) all accrued interest on the portion of the Obligation being
prepaid must also be paid in full on the date of payment; and  (iv) Borrower shall pay any related Funding Loss upon
demand.  3.3 Interest Options. 
(a) Except as specifically otherwise provided, Borrowings bear interest at an annual rate equal to the lesser of (i) the
ABR plus the Applicable Margin or the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin (in each case as designated or deemed designated by Borrower and, in the case of LIBOR Rate Borrowings, for the Interest Period designated by Borrower), as the case may be,
and (ii) the Maximum Rate. Each change in the ABR and Maximum Rate is effective, without notice to Borrower or any other Person, upon the effective date of change. 
(b) Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if a Default has occurred and is continuing and Administrative Agent, at the
request of Majority Lenders, so notifies Borrower, then, so long as a Default is continuing, (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be made as, converted to or continued as a LIBOR Rate Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each LIBOR Rate Borrowing
shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.  3.4 Quotation of Rates. A Responsible
Officer of Borrower may call Administrative Agent before delivering a Borrowing Request to receive an indication of the interest rates then in effect, but the indicated rates do not bind Administrative Agent or Lenders or affect the interest rate
that is actually in effect when Borrower delivers its Borrowing Request or on the Borrowing Date. 
  28 


3.5 Default Rate. If permitted by Law, at the request of the Majority Lenders, at any time
a Default has occurred and is continuing, all past-due Principal Debt, Borrowers past-due payment and reimbursement obligations in connection with LCs, and past-due interest accruing on any of the foregoing, shall bear interest at the Default
Rate until paid, regardless whether payment is made before or after entry of a judgment.  3.6 Interest Recapture. If the designated
interest rate applicable to any Borrowing exceeds the Maximum Rate, the interest rate on that Borrowing is limited to the Maximum Rate, but, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, any subsequent reductions in the designated rate shall not
reduce the interest rate thereon below the Maximum Rate until the total amount of accrued interest equals the amount of interest that would have accrued if that designated rate had always been in effect. If at maturity (stated or by acceleration),
or at final payment of the Notes, the total interest paid or accrued is less than the interest that would have accrued if the designated rates had always been in effect, then, at that time and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Borrower
shall pay an amount equal to the difference between (a) the lesser of the amount of interest that would have accrued if the designated rates had always been in effect and the amount of interest that would have accrued if the Maximum Rate had
always been in effect, and (b) the amount of interest actually paid or accrued on the Notes.  3.7 Interest Calculations. 
(a) Interest hereunder shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to
the ABR at times when the ABR is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day). All interest rate determinations and calculations by Administrative Agent are conclusive and binding absent manifest error. 
(b) The provisions of this Agreement relating to calculation of the ABR and LIBOR Rates are included only for the purpose of
determining the rate of interest or other amounts to be paid under this Agreement that are based upon those rates.  3.8 Maximum
Rate. Regardless of any provision contained in any Loan Paper or any document related thereto, it is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender contract for, charge, take, reserve, receive, or
apply as interest on all or any part of the Obligation any amount in excess of the Maximum Rate or the Maximum Amount or receive any unearned interest in violation of any applicable Law, and, if Lenders ever do so, then any excess shall be treated
as a partial repayment or prepayment of principal and any remaining excess shall be refunded to Borrower. In determining if the interest paid or payable exceeds the Maximum Rate, Borrower and Lenders shall, to the maximum extent permitted under
applicable Law, (a) treat all Borrowings as but a single extension of credit (and Lenders and Borrower agree that is the case and that provision in this Agreement for multiple Borrowings is for convenience only); (b) characterize any
nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest; (c) exclude voluntary repayments or prepayments and 
  29 



their effects; and (d) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the Obligation. However, if the Obligation is paid in
full before the end of its full contemplated term, and if the interest received for its actual period of existence exceeds the Maximum Amount, Lenders shall refund any excess (and Lenders may not, to the extent permitted by Law, be subject to any
penalties provided by any Laws for contracting for, charging, taking, reserving, or receiving interest in excess of the Maximum Amount). 
3.9 Interest Periods. When Borrower requests any LIBOR Rate Borrowing, Borrower may elect the applicable interest period (each an
Interest Period), which may be, at Borrowers option, one (1), two (2), three (3), or six (6) months for LIBOR Rate Borrowings, subject to the following conditions: (a) the initial Interest Period for a LIBOR
Rate Borrowing commences on the applicable Borrowing Date or conversion date, and each subsequent Interest Period applicable to any Borrowing commences on the day when the next preceding applicable Interest Period expires; (b) if any Interest
Period for a LIBOR Rate Borrowing begins on a day for which there exists no numerically corresponding Business Day in the calendar month at the end of the Interest Period (Ending Calendar Month), then the Interest Period
ends on the next succeeding Business Day of the Ending Calendar Month, unless there is no succeeding Business Day in the Ending Calendar Month in which case the Interest Period ends on the next preceding Business Day of the Ending Calendar Month;
(c) no Interest Period for any portion of Principal Debt may extend beyond the scheduled repayment date for that portion of Principal Debt; and (d) there may not be in effect at any one time more than six (6) Interest Periods under
the Facility.  3.10 Conversions. Subject to Section 3.3(b), Borrower may (a) on the last day of the
applicable Interest Period convert all or part of a LIBOR Rate Borrowing to an ABR Borrowing; (b) at any time convert all or part of an ABR Borrowing to a LIBOR Rate Borrowing; and (c) elect a new Interest Period for a LIBOR Rate
Borrowing. Any such conversion is subject to the dollar limits and denominations of Section 2.1 and may be accomplished by delivering a Conversion Request to Administrative Agent no later than (i) 12:00 noon on the third
Business Day before the conversion date for conversion to a LIBOR Rate Borrowing and the last day of the Interest Period, for the election of a new Interest Period, and (ii) 11:00 a.m. on the last day of the Interest Period for conversion to an
ABR Borrowing. Absent Borrowers notice of conversion or election of a new Interest Period, a LIBOR Rate Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing when the applicable Interest Period expires. 
3.11 Order of Application. 
(a) If no Default or Potential Default exists, any payment shall be applied to the Obligation in the order and manner as
provided in this Agreement.  (b) If a Default or Potential Default exists, any payment (including proceeds from the
exercise of any Rights) shall be applied in the following order: (i) to all fees and expenses for which Administrative Agent or Lenders have not been paid or reimbursed in accordance with the Loan Papers (and if such payment is less than all
unpaid or unreimbursed fees and expenses, then the payment shall be paid against unpaid and unreimbursed fees and expenses in the order of incurrence or due date); (ii) to accrued interest on the Principal Debt; (iii) to the Principal of
Debt outstanding under the Swing Line Subfacility; (iv) to any LC 
  30 



reimbursement obligations that are due and payable and that remain unfunded by any Borrowing under the Facility; (v) to the Principal Debt, (vi) as a deposit with Administrative Agent,
for the benefit of Lenders, as security for and payment of any subsequent LC reimbursement obligations; (vii) ratably to Hedging Obligations and obligations of Borrower or any Company to any Lender in respect of treasury management services or
other banking services; and (viii) the balance, if any, after the Obligation, Hedging Obligations and such other obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, to Borrower or as otherwise required by Law, provided, however, that (A) with
respect to any Guarantor, no proceeds of any guarantee made by such Guarantor and no proceeds of the Collateral of such Guarantor shall be applied to any Excluded Hedging Obligation of such Guarantor, and (B) after giving effect to clause (A),
any remaining proceeds shall be reallocated in order to effect a ratable distribution among the Administrative Agent and Lenders, as described above. 
3.12 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender obtains any amount (whether voluntary, involuntary or otherwise, including, without
limitation, as a result of exercising its Rights under Section 3.13) that exceeds its combined Pro Rata Part of the Facility Commitment Usage, then that Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders participations that will cause
the purchasing Lender to share the excess amount ratably with each other Lender. If all or any portion of any excess amount is subsequently recovered from the purchasing Lender, then the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to
the extent of the recovery. Borrower agrees that any Lender purchasing a participation from another Lender under this Section may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, exercise all of its Rights of payment (including the Right of offset) with
respect to that participation as fully as if that Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of that participation.  3.13
Offset. If a Default exists, each Lender is entitled, but is not obligated, to exercise (for the benefit of all Lenders in accordance with Section 3.12) the Rights of offset and bankers Lien against each and every
account and other property, or any interest therein, that any Company may now or hereafter have with, or which is now or hereafter in the possession of, that Lender to the extent of the full amount of the Obligation owed to it. 
3.14 Booking Borrowings. To the extent permitted by Law, any Lender may make, carry, or transfer its Borrowings at, to, or for the
account of any of its branch offices or the office of any of its Affiliates. However, no Affiliate is entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.16 than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive with
respect to those Borrowings.  3.15 Basis Unavailable or Inadequate for LIBOR. If, on or before any date when LIBOR Rate is to be
determined for a Borrowing, Administrative Agent, or any Lender determines (and Majority Lenders agree with that determination) that the basis for determining the applicable rate is not available or that the resulting rate does not accurately
reflect the cost to Lenders of making or converting Borrowings at that rate for the applicable Interest Period, then Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and Lenders of that determination (which is conclusive and binding on Borrower
absent manifest error) and the applicable Borrowing shall bear interest at the sum of the ABR plus the Applicable Margin. Until Administrative Agent notifies Borrower that those circumstances no longer exist, Lenders commitments under this
Agreement to make, or to convert to, LIBOR Rate Borrowings (as the case may be) will be suspended. 
  31 


3.16 Additional Costs. 
With respect to any Law, requirement, request, directive, or change affecting banking institutions generally: 
(a) With respect to any LIBOR Rate Borrowing or ABR Borrowing, if (i) any Change in Law imposes, modifies, or deems
applicable (or if compliance by any Lender therewith results in) any requirement that any reserves (including, without limitation, any marginal, emergency, supplemental, or special reserves) be maintained or increased, and (ii) those reserves
reduce any sums receivable by that Lender under this Agreement or increase the costs incurred by that Lender in advancing or maintaining any portion of any LIBOR Rate Borrowing, or ABR Borrowing, then (unless the effect is already reflected in the
rate of interest then applicable under this Agreement) that Lender (through Administrative Agent) shall deliver to Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of the amount necessary to compensate it for its
reduction or increase (which certificate is conclusive and binding absent manifest error), and Borrower shall promptly pay that amount to that Lender within 5 days of demand thereof. The provisions of and undertakings and indemnification set forth
in this paragraph shall survive the satisfaction and payment of the Obligation and termination of this Agreement.  (b) With
respect to any Borrowing or LC, if any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity (or compliance by Administrative Agent (as issuer of LCs) or any Lender therewith), reduces the rate of return on the capital of Administrative Agent (as
issuer of LCs) or such Lender, or the holding company of Administrative Agent or such Lender, as a consequence of its obligations under this Agreement to a level below that which it otherwise could have achieved (taking into consideration its
policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by it to be material (and it may, in determining the amount, use reasonable assumptions and allocations of costs and expenses and use any reasonable averaging or attribution
method), then (unless the effect is already reflected in the rate of interest then applicable under this Agreement) Administrative Agent or that Lender (through Administrative Agent) shall notify Borrower and deliver to Borrower a certificate
setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amount necessary to compensate it (which certificate is conclusive and binding absent manifest error), and Borrower shall promptly pay that amount to Administrative Agent or that Lender
within 5 days of demand thereof. The provisions of and undertakings and indemnification set forth in this paragraph shall survive the satisfaction and payment of the Obligation and termination of this Agreement. 
(c) Any Taxes payable by Administrative Agent or any Lender or ruled (by a Tribunal) payable by Administrative Agent or any
Lender in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Paper shall, if permitted by Law, be paid by Borrower, together with interest and penalties, if any (except for (i)(1) Taxes imposed on or measured by the net income of Administrative Agent or
that Lender (2) franchise or similar taxes of the Administrative Agent or that Lender and (3) amounts requested to be withheld for Taxes pursuant to the first sentence of Section 3.19(b) and (ii) interest and
penalties incurred as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Administrative Agent or any Lender). 
  32 



Administrative Agent or that Lender (through Administrative Agent) shall notify Borrower and deliver to Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of the
amount of payable Taxes, which certificate is conclusive and binding (absent manifest error), and Borrower shall promptly pay that amount to Administrative Agent for its account or the account of that Lender, as the case may be. If Administrative
Agent or that Lender subsequently receives a refund of the Taxes paid to it by Borrower, then the recipient shall promptly pay the refund to Borrower. 
3.17 Change in Laws. If any Change in Law makes it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Borrowing based on the LIBOR Rate
Borrowings, then that Lender shall promptly notify Borrower and Administrative Agent, and (a) as to undisbursed funds, that requested Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing subject to the higher of the Prime Rate and the Federal Funds
Effective Rate plus 1%, and (b), as to any outstanding Borrowing, (i) if maintaining the Borrowing until the last day of the applicable Interest Period is unlawful, the Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing as of the date of notice,
and Borrower shall pay any related Funding Loss, or (ii) if not prohibited by Law, the Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period, or (iii) if any conversion will not resolve the
unlawfulness, Borrower shall promptly prepay the Borrowing, without penalty, together with any related Funding Loss.  3.18 Funding
Loss. BORROWER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY EACH LENDER AGAINST, AND PAY TO IT WITHIN 5 DAYS OF DEMAND THEREFOR, ANY FUNDING LOSS OF THAT LENDER. When any Lender demands that Borrower pay any Funding Loss, that Lender shall deliver to Borrower and
Administrative Agent a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for imposing Funding Loss and the calculation of the amount, which calculation is conclusive and binding absent manifest error. The provisions of and undertakings and
indemnification set forth in this paragraph shall survive the satisfaction and payment of the Obligation and termination of this Agreement. 
3.19 Foreign Lenders. 
(a) Each Lender that is not a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a
Non-U.S. Lender) shall deliver to Administrative Agent, prior to the receipt of any payment subject to withholding under the Code (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest
herein), two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or any successor thereto (relating to such Non-U.S. Lender and entitling it to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be
made to such Non-U.S. Lender by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Non-U.S. Lender by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory
to Administrative Agent that such Non-U.S. Lender is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, United States withholding tax, including any exemption pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Code. Thereafter and from time to time, each such
Non-U.S. Lender shall (i) upon the written request of Administrative Agent promptly submit to Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to
time by the relevant United States taxing 
  33 



authorities) as may then be available under the then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to Administrative Agent of any available exemption
from or reduction of, United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Non-U.S. Lender by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) promptly notify Administrative Agent of any change in circumstance which would
modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction. Each Non-U.S. Lender, to the extent it does not act or ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan Papers
(for example, in the case of a participation by such Lender), shall deliver to Administrative Agent on the date when such Non-U.S. Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at such
other times as may be necessary in the determination of Administrative Agent (in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly signed completed copies of the forms or statements required to be provided by such Lender as set forth
above, to establish the portion of any such sums paid or payable with respect to which such Lender acts for its own account that is not subject to U.S. withholding tax, and (B) two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any
successor thereto), together with any information such Lender chooses to transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption required under the Code, to establish that such Lender is not acting for its own account with
respect to a portion of any sums payable to such Lender.  (b) Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amount
to any Non-U.S. Lender under Section 3.19(a): (i) with respect to any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld on the basis of the information, certificates or statements of exemption such Lender transmits with an IRS Form
W-8IMY pursuant to Section 3.19(a) or (ii) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the provisions of Section 3.19(a) on the date such Lender became a Lender or ceases to act for its own account with
respect to any payment under any of the Loan Papers. Nothing in this Section 3.19(b) or Section 3.19(a) shall relieve Borrower of its obligation to pay any amounts due pursuant to this
Section 3.19 in the event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender is no
longer properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person for the account of which such Lender receives any sums payable under any of the Loan Papers is not
subject to withholding or is subject to withholding at a reduced rate. Administrative Agent may, without reduction, withhold any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any payment under any of the Loan Papers with respect to which Borrower
is not required to pay additional amounts under Section 3.19(a).  (c) If a payment made to any Lender
hereunder would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as
applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Borrower and Administrative Agent to comply with their
obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. 
  34 


3.20 Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: 
(a) fees under Section 4.3 shall cease to accrue on that portion of such Defaulting Lenders Committed
Sum that remains unfunded or which has not been included in any LC Exposure;  (b) the Committed Sum and Commitment Usage of
such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or Majority Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 14.10), provided
that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which adversely affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender. 
(c) if any LC Exposure or Swing Line Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then: 
(i) all or any part of the contingent obligations of Lenders in respect of such LC Exposure and Swing Line Exposure shall be
reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Part but only to the extent (a) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Commitment Usage plus such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure and Swing Line
Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Committed Sums and (b) no Lenders Commitment Usage exceeds its Committed Sum; 
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, Borrower shall, within
one (1) Business Day following notice by Administrative Agent, (A) prepay the Swing Line Borrowings and (B) cash collateralize such Defaulting Lenders Pro Rata Part of the LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial
reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding; 
(iii) if Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure pursuant to this
Section 3.20(c), Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 4.2 with respect to such cash collateralized portion of the Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure
during the period such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is cash collateralized;  (iv) if the LC Exposure of the
non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this Section 3.20(c), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 4.2 shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Pro
Rata Part of the Facility Committed Sum; and 
  35 


(v) if any Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized
nor reallocated pursuant to this Section 3.20(c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, all fees payable to Lenders pursuant to Section 4.2 with
respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure that is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated shall be payable to Administrative Agent until such LC Exposure is fully cash collateralized and/or reallocated; 
(d) so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent shall not be (i) required to fund any Swing Line
Borrowing or (ii) required to issue, amend, renew, increase or extend any LC unless it is satisfied, in its reasonable discretion, that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Committed Sums of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash
collateral will be provided by Borrower in accordance with Section 3.20(c), and participating interests in any such newly issued, amended, renewed, increased or extended LC or newly made Swing Line Borrowing shall be allocated
among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 3.20(c)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein); and 
(e) any amount payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder (whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise)
shall, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Lender, be retained by Administrative Agent in a segregated account and subject to any applicable requirements of law, be applied (i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such
Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent hereunder, (ii) second, to the funding of cash collateralization of any participating interest in any LC in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by
this Agreement, as determined by Administrative Agent, (iii) third, if so determined by Administrative Agent and Borrower, held in such account as cash collateral for future funding obligations of any Defaulting Lender under this Agreement,
(iv) fourth, pro rata, to the payment of any amounts owing to Borrower or Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by Borrower or any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting
Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement and (v) fifth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that if such payment is (x) a prepayment of the principal amount
of any Borrowing and (y) made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 6.2 are satisfied, such payment shall be applied solely to prepay the Borrowings of all non-Defaulting Lenders pro rata prior to being applied
to the prepayment of any Borrowings of any Defaulting Lender.  In the event that Administrative Agent and Borrower each agrees that a Defaulting Lender
has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then on such date the LC Exposure and Swing Line Exposure of Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Committed Sum and on such
date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Borrowings of the other Lenders as Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Borrowings in accordance with its Pro Rata Part. Except as expressly
modified by this Section 3.20, the performance by Borrower under any Loan Paper shall not be excused or otherwise modified as a result of this Section 3.20. 
3.21 Assignment of Committed Sums Under Certain Circumstances. In the event that (1) any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.16, (2) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount pursuant to Section 3.19, (3) any Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender, or 
  36 



(4) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, Borrower shall have the right, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and Administrative Agent to require such Lender to transfer and assign
without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 14.12) all its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more other financial institutions acceptable to Borrower
(unless a Default has occurred and is continuing) and Administrative Agent (which in each case shall not be unreasonably withheld), which shall assume such obligations; provided that (i) no such assignment shall conflict with any law, rule or
regulation or order of any Tribunal. (ii) the Lender that acts as Administrative Agent cannot be replaced in its capacity as Administrative Agent other than in accordance with Section 13.1, (iii) any Lender that is the issuer of LCs
may not be replaced hereunder at any time when it has any LCs outstanding hereunder unless arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such issuer (including the furnishing of a back-up standby letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an
issuer, reasonably satisfactory to such issuer or the depositing of cash collateral into a cash collateral account in amounts and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such issuer) have been made with respect to each such outstanding
LC; and (iv) Borrower or the assignee or assignees, as the case may be, shall pay to each affected Lender in immediately available funds on the date of such assignment the principal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on the
Borrowings made by it hereunder and all other amounts accrued for its account or owed to it hereunder. Upon receipt by the applicable Lender of all amounts required to be paid to such Lender pursuant to this Section 3.21,
Administrative Agent shall be entitled (but not obligated) and authorized to execute an Assignment Agreement on behalf of such Lender, and any such Assignment Agreement so executed by Administrative Agent and the assignee shall be effective for
purposes of this Section 3.21 and Section 14.12. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment if, prior to Administrative Agents approval of such assignment, the circumstances entitling
Borrower to require such assignment cease to apply. In the event that (i) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent has requested that the Lenders consent to a departure or waiver of any provisions of the Loan Papers or agree to any amendment
thereto, (ii) the consent, waiver or amendment in question requires the agreement of each Lender, all affected Lenders or all the Lenders and (iii) the Majority Lenders have agreed to such consent, waiver or amendment, then any Lender who
does not agree to such consent, waiver or amendment shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Lender.  3.22 Matters
Applicable to All Requests for Compensation.  (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender
requests compensation under Section 3.16 or 3.17, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount pursuant to Section 3.19, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or
booking its loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the good faith judgment of such Lender such designation or assignment (a) would eliminate or reduce amounts
payable pursuant to Section 3.16, 3.17, or 3.19, as the case may be, in the future, and (b) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any
material economic, legal or regulatory respect. 
  37 


(b) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to
demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of Section 3.16, 3.17 or 3.19 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate
a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of Section 3.16, 3.17 or 3.19 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the
event giving rise to such claim and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).  SECTION 4. FEES. 
4.1 Treatment of Fees. The fees described in this Section 4 are calculated on the basis of actual number of days
(including the first day but excluding the last day) elapsed, but computed as if each calendar year consisted of three hundred sixty (360) days, unless computation would result in an interest rate in excess of the Maximum Rate in which event
the computation is made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be. The fees described in this Section 4 are in all events subject to the provisions of Section 3.8 of this Agreement. 
4.2 LC Fees. As a condition to the issuance or extension of a LC, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent (and such payment shall
accompany each LC Request) a fee equal to (a) one-eighth of one percent (0.125%) multiplied by (b) the face amount of the LC, payable quarterly in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year,
and on the Facility Maturity Date. Borrower shall also pay a commission on all outstanding LCs at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin with respect to LIBOR Rate Borrowings on the face amount of each LC. Such commission shall be payable
quarterly in arrears to Administrative Agent for ratable distribution among the Lenders participating in the Facility. Borrower also agrees to pay on demand and solely for the account of Administrative Agent, any and all additional customary LC fees
including those relating to administering, issuing, confirming, negotiating or amending LCs.  4.3 Facility Commitment Fee. Borrower
shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee (Commitment Fee), payable as it accrues on each March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, and on the
Facility Maturity Date, equal to the Applicable Margin times the amount by which (a) such Lenders Facility Committed Sum exceeds (b) such Lenders average daily Facility Commitment Usage, in each case during the calendar quarter
ending on such date. If there is any change in the Applicable Margin during any quarter, the average daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Margin separately for each period that such Applicable Margin was in effect during
such quarter.  4.4 Other Fees. Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent, Lenders, and each Arranger, for their own account, fees
and other amounts payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between Borrower and such Persons in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. 
  38 


SECTION 5. SECURITY. 
5.1 Collateral. Full and complete payment of the Obligation is secured by all of the Collateral. 
5.2 Additional Security and Guaranties. Administrative Agent may, without notice or demand and without affecting any Persons
obligations under the Loan Papers, from time to time (a) receive and hold additional collateral from any Person for the payment of all or any part of the Obligation and, subject to Section 14.10(b), exchange, enforce or
release all or any part of that collateral and (b) accept and hold any endorsement or guaranty of payment of all or any part of the Obligation and, subject to Section 14.10(b), release any endorser or guarantor, or any Person
who has given any other security for the payment of all or any part of the Obligation, or any other Person in any way obligated to pay all or any part of the Obligation. 
5.3 Financing Statements. Borrower will execute, or cause to be executed, stock powers and other writings in the form and content
reasonably required by Administrative Agent, and Borrower will pay all costs of filing any financing, continuation or termination statements, or other action taken by Administrative Agent relating to the Collateral, including, without limitation,

this Agreement, and thereafter until the Obligation (other than unasserted contingent obligations) is paid and performed in full, Borrower covenants and agrees to comply with the following financial covenants as calculated on the last day of each
fiscal quarter period and certified by Borrower in the most recent Compliance Certificate delivered to Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, from time to time in accordance with the terms of this Agreement: 
(a) Interest Coverage Ratio. At all times, Borrower shall not permit the Interest Coverage Ratio to be less than 1.55 to
1.00.  (b) Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR. Borrower shall not permit Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR to exceed 4.75 to 1.00 as of

within sixty (60) days after entry, to pay, bond or otherwise discharge any judgment or order for the payment of money in excess of $10,000,000 (individually or collectively) or any warrant of attachment, sequestration, or similar proceeding

Tribunal (including, but not limited to, the United States Justice Department) seeking to cause any Company to divest a significant portion of its assets under any antitrust, restraint of trade, unfair

  59

11.8 Default Under Other Agreements. (a) Any Company fails to pay when due (after lapse of any applicable grace period) any Debt

SECTION 12. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. 
12.1 Remedies Upon Default. 
(a) If a Default (i) occurs under Section 11.3(c) or (ii) occurs and is continuing under
Section 11.3(a), (b), or (d), the commitment to extend credit under this Agreement automatically terminates, the entire unpaid balance of the Obligation automatically becomes due and payable without any
action of any kind whatsoever, and Borrower must provide cash collateral in an amount equal to the then-existing LC Exposure. 
  60 


(b) If a Default occurs and is continuing, subject to the terms of
Section 13.5(b), Administrative Agent may (with the consent of, and must, upon the request of, Majority Lenders), do any one or more of the following: (i) if the maturity of the Obligation has not already been accelerated
under Section 12.1(a), declare the entire unpaid balance of all or any part of the Obligation immediately due and payable, whereupon it is due and payable; (ii) terminate the commitments of Lenders to extend credit under this
Agreement; (iii) reduce any claim to judgment; (iv) to the extent permitted by Law, exercise (or request each Lender to, and each Lender is entitled to, exercise) the Rights of offset or bankers Lien against the interest of any
Company in and to every account and other property of any Company that are in the possession of Administrative Agent or any Lender to the extent of the full amount of the Obligation (and to the extent permitted by Law, each Company is deemed
directly obligated to each Lender in the full amount of the Obligation for this purpose); (v) demand Borrower to provide cash collateral in an amount equal to the LC Exposure then existing; and (vi) exercise any and all other legal or
equitable Rights afforded by the Loan Papers, the Laws of the State of New York, or any other applicable jurisdiction.  (c)
If, in reliance on Section 13.5(b), Administrative Agent refuses to take any action under Section 12.1(b) at the request of Majority Lenders, then Majority Lenders may take that action. 
12.2 Company Waivers. To the extent permitted by Law, each Company waives presentment and demand for payment, protest, notice of
intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration, and notice of protest and nonpayment and agrees that its liability with respect to all or any part of the Obligation is not affected by any renewal or extension in the time of payment of all or any
part of the Obligation, by any indulgence, or by any release or change in any security for the payment of all or any part of the Obligation. 
12.3 Performance by Administrative Agent. If any covenant, duty or agreement of any Company is not performed in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Papers, Administrative Agent may, while a Default exists, at its option (but subject to the approval of Majority Lenders), perform or attempt to perform that covenant, duty or agreement on behalf of that Company (and any amount
expended by Administrative Agent in its performance or attempted performance is payable by the Companies, jointly and severally, to Administrative Agent on demand, becomes part of the Obligation, and bears interest at the Default Rate from the date
of Administrative Agents expenditure until paid). However, neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender assumes or shall have, except by its express written consent, any liability or responsibility for the performance of any covenant, duty, or
agreement of any Company.  12.4 Not in Control. None of the covenants or other provisions contained in any Loan Paper shall, or
shall be deemed to, give Administrative Agent or Lenders the Right to exercise control over the assets (including, without limitation, real property), affairs, or management of any Company; the power of Administrative Agent and Lenders is limited to
the Right to exercise the remedies provided in this Section 12.  12.5 Course of Dealing. The acceptance by
Administrative Agent or Lenders of any partial payment on the Obligation shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any Default then existing. No waiver by Administrative Agent, Majority Lenders, or Lenders of any Default shall be deemed to be a waiver
of any other then-existing or subsequent Default. 
  61 



No delay or omission by Administrative Agent, Majority Lenders, or Lenders in exercising any Right under the Loan Papers will impair that Right or be construed as a waiver thereof or any
acquiescence therein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any Right preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other Right under the Loan Papers or otherwise. 
12.6 Cumulative Rights. All Rights available to Administrative Agent, Majority Lenders, and Lenders under the Loan Papers are
cumulative of and in addition to all other Rights granted to Administrative Agent, Majority Lenders, and Lenders at law or in equity, whether or not the Obligation is due and payable and whether or not Administrative Agent, Majority Lenders, or
Lenders have instituted any suit for collection, foreclosure, or other action in connection with the Loan Papers.  12.7 Application of
Proceeds. Any and all proceeds ever received by Administrative Agent or Lenders from the exercise of any Rights pertaining to the Obligation shall be applied to the Obligation according to Section 3.11. 
12.8 Diminution in Value of Collateral. Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any liability or responsibility whatsoever for
any diminution in or loss of value of any collateral now or hereafter securing payment or performance of all or any part of the Obligation (other than diminution in or loss of value caused by its gross negligence or willful misconduct). 
12.9 Certain Proceedings. Borrower will promptly execute and deliver, or cause the execution and delivery of, all applications,
certificates, instruments, registration statements, and all other documents and papers Administrative Agent or Majority Lenders reasonably request in connection with the obtaining of any consent, approval, registration, qualification, permit,
license, or authorization of any Tribunal or other Person necessary or appropriate for the effective exercise of any Rights under the Loan Papers. Because Borrower agrees that Administrative Agents and Majority Lenders remedies at Law
for failure of Borrower to comply with the provisions of this paragraph would be inadequate and that failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, Borrower agrees that the covenants of this paragraph may be specifically enforced. 
12.10 Change of Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Majority Lenders may, upon the
happening of a Change of Control, declare the Notes due and payable on a date not earlier than the earliest to occur of (i) sixty (60) days after delivery of written notice to Borrower and (ii) the Borrowers failure to promptly
deliver or cause to be delivered all documentation and other information required by regulatory authorities under applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act, following the
written request therefor by the Administrative Agent after such Change of Control, which request shall describe all such required documentation and information in reasonable detail. The Notes then outstanding (including all Principal Debt plus
accrued interest thereon and any other amounts owed by Borrower to Administrative Agent or Lenders pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Paper) shall thereupon become automatically due and payable on the date set forth in such notice without
any further notice or demand of any kind. 
  62 


SECTION 13. AGREEMENT AMONG LENDERS. 
 


13.1
Administrative Agent.  (a) Each Lender appoints Administrative Agent
(and Administrative Agent accepts appointment) as its nominee and agent, in its name and on its behalf: (i) to act as its nominee and on its behalf in, under and in accordance with all Loan Papers; (ii) to arrange the means whereby its
funds are to be made available to Borrower under the Loan Papers; (iii) to take any action that it properly requests under the Loan Papers (subject to the concurrence of other Lenders as may be required under the Loan Papers); (iv) to
receive all documents and items to be furnished to it under the Loan Papers; (v) to be the secured party, mortgagee, beneficiary, recipient, and similar party in respect of any collateral for the benefit of Lenders; (vi) to promptly
distribute to it all material information, requests, documents, and items received from Borrower under the Loan Papers; (vii) to promptly distribute to it its ratable part of each payment or prepayment (whether voluntary, as proceeds of
collateral upon or after foreclosure, as proceeds of insurance thereon, or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the Loan Papers (including without limitation, environmental notices, notices of default and all financial statements and
Compliance Certificates); and (viii) to deliver to the appropriate Persons requests, demands, approvals, and consents received from it. However, Administrative Agent may not be required to take any action that exposes it to personal liability
or that is contrary to any Loan Paper or applicable Law.  (b) If the initial or any successor Administrative Agent ever
ceases to be a party to this Agreement or if the initial or any successor Administrative Agent ever resigns (whether voluntarily or at the request of Majority Lenders), then Majority Lenders (with the consent of the Borrower, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) shall appoint the successor Administrative Agent from among the Lenders with Commitment Sums of at least $25,000,000 (other than the resigning Administrative Agent). If Majority Lenders fail to appoint
a successor Administrative Agent within thirty (30) days after the resigning Administrative Agent has given notice of resignation or Majority Lenders have removed the resigning Administrative Agent, then the resigning Administrative Agent may,
on behalf of Lenders and with the consent of the Borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which must be a commercial bank having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$1,000,000,000 (as shown on its most recently published statement of condition). Upon its acceptance of appointment as successor Administrative Agent, the successor Administrative Agent succeeds to and becomes vested with all of the Rights of the
prior Administrative Agent, and the prior Administrative Agent is discharged from its duties and obligations of Administrative Agent under the Loan Papers (but, when used in connection with LCs issued and outstanding before the appointment of the
successor Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent shall continue to refer solely to Citizens Bank, N.A.), and each Lender shall execute such documents as any Lender, the resigning or removed Administrative Agent, or the successor
Administrative Agent reasonably request to reflect the change. After any Administrative Agents resignation or removal as Administrative Agent under the Loan Papers, the provisions of this Section 13 inure to its benefit as
to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under the Loan Papers. 
  63 


(c) Administrative Agent, in its capacity as a Lender, has the same Rights under
the Loan Papers as any other Lender and may exercise those Rights as if it were not acting as Administrative Agent; the term Lender shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include Administrative Agent; and Administrative
Agents resignation or removal shall not impair or otherwise affect any Rights that it has or may have in its capacity as an individual Lender. Each Lender and Borrower agree that Administrative Agent is not a fiduciary for Lenders or for
Borrower but simply is acting in the capacity described in this Agreement to alleviate administrative burdens for Borrower and Lenders, that Administrative Agent has no duties or responsibilities to Lenders or Borrower except those expressly set
forth in the Loan Papers, and that Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Lender has all Rights of any other Lender. 
(d) Administrative Agent may now or hereafter be engaged in one or more loan, letter of credit, leasing or other financing
transaction with Borrower, act as trustee or depositary for Borrower, or otherwise be engaged in other transactions with Borrower (the other activities) not the subject of the Loan Papers. Without limiting the Rights of Lenders
specifically set forth in the Loan Papers, Administrative Agent is not responsible to account to Lenders for those other activities, and no Lender shall have any interest in any other activities, any present or future guaranties by or for the
account of Borrower that are not contemplated or included in the Loan Papers, any present or future offset exercised by Administrative Agent in respect of those other activities, any present or future property taken as security for any of those
other activities, or any property now or hereafter in Administrative Agents possession or control that may be or become security for the obligations of Borrower arising under the Loan Papers by reason of the general description of indebtedness
secured or of property contained in any other agreements, documents, or instruments related to any of those other activities (but, if any payments in respect of those guaranties or that property or the proceeds thereof is applied by Administrative
Agent to reduce the Obligation, then each Lender is entitled to share ratably in the application as provided in the Loan Papers).  13.2
Expenses. Each Lender shall pay its Pro Rata Part of any reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, court costs, reasonable attorneys fees, and other costs of collection) incurred by Administrative Agent (while acting in such
capacity) in connection with any of the Loan Papers if Administrative Agent is not reimbursed from other sources within thirty (30) days after incurrence. Each Lender is entitled to receive its Pro Rata Part of any reimbursement that it makes
to Administrative Agent if Administrative Agent is subsequently reimbursed from other sources.  13.3 Proportionate Absorption of
Losses. Except as otherwise provided in the Loan Papers, nothing in the Loan Papers gives any Lender any advantage over any other Lender insofar as the Obligation (other than any Hedging Obligation) is concerned or to relieve any Lender from
ratably absorbing any losses sustained with respect to the Obligation (except (x) for Hedging Obligations and (y) to the extent unilateral actions or inactions by any Lender result in Borrower or any other obligor on the Obligation having
any credit, allowance, setoff, defense, or counterclaim solely with respect to all or any part of that Lenders Pro Rata Part of the Obligation). 
  64 


13.4 Delegation of Duties; Reliance. Lenders may perform any of their duties or exercise
any of their Rights under the Loan Papers by or through Administrative Agent, and Lenders and Administrative Agent may perform any of their duties or exercise any of their Rights under the Loan Papers by or through their respective Representatives.
Administrative Agent, Lenders and their respective Representatives (a) are entitled to rely upon (and shall be protected in relying upon) any written or oral statement believed by it or them to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or
made by the proper Person and, with respect to legal matters, upon opinion of counsel selected by Administrative Agent or that Lender (but nothing in this clause (a) permits Administrative Agent to rely on (i) oral statements if a writing
is required by this Agreement or (ii) any other writing if a specific writing is required by this Agreement), (b) are entitled to deem and treat each Lender as the owner and holder of its Pro Rata Part of the Principal Debt for all
purposes until, subject to Section 14.12, written notice of the assignment or transfer is given to and received by Administrative Agent (and any request, authorization, consent or approval of any Lender is conclusive and binding
on each subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of or Participant in that Lenders Pro Rata Part of the Principal Debt until that notice is given and received), (c) are not deemed to have notice of the occurrence of a Default unless a
responsible officer of Administrative Agent, who handles matters associated with the Loan Papers and transactions thereunder, has actual knowledge or Administrative Agent has been notified by a Lender or Borrower, and (d) are entitled to
consult with legal counsel (including counsel for Borrower), independent accountants, and other experts selected by Administrative Agent and are not liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice
of counsel, accountants, or experts.  13.5 Limitation of Administrative Agents Liability. 
(a) Neither Administrative Agent nor any of its Representatives will be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
it or them under the Loan Papers in good faith and believed by it or them to be within the discretion or power conferred upon it or them by the Loan Papers or be responsible for the consequences of any error of judgment (except for fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct), and neither Administrative Agent nor any of its Representatives has a fiduciary relationship with any Lender by virtue of the Loan Papers (but nothing in this Agreement negates the obligation of Administrative
Agent to account for funds received by it for the account of any Lender).  (b) Unless indemnified to its satisfaction,
Administrative Agent may not be compelled to do any act under the Loan Papers or to take any action toward the execution or enforcement of the powers thereby created or to prosecute or defend any suit in respect of the Loan Papers. If Administrative
Agent requests instructions from Lenders, or Majority Lenders, as the case may be, with respect to any act or action in connection with any Loan Paper, Administrative Agent is entitled to refrain (without incurring any liability to any Person by so
refraining) from that act or action unless and until it has received instructions. In no event, however, may Administrative Agent or any of its Representatives be required to take any action that it or they determine could incur for it or them
criminal or onerous civil liability. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Lender has any right of action against Administrative Agent as a result of Administrative Agents acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement in
accordance with instructions of Majority Lenders, or, if unanimity is required, in accordance with instructions of all Lenders. 
  65 


(c) Administrative Agent is not responsible to any Lender or any Participant for,
and each Lender represents and warrants that it has not relied upon Administrative Agent in respect of, (i) the creditworthiness of any Company and the risks involved to that Lender, (ii) the effectiveness, enforceability, genuineness,
validity or due execution of any Loan Paper (other than by Administrative Agent), (iii) any representation, warranty, document, certificate, report or statement made therein (other than by Administrative Agent) or furnished thereunder or in
connection therewith, (iv) the adequacy of any collateral now or hereafter securing the Obligation or the existence, priority or perfection of any Lien now or hereafter granted or purported to be granted on the collateral under any Loan Paper,
or (v) the observance of or compliance with any of the terms, covenants or conditions of any Loan Paper on the part of any Company. EACH LENDER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES AND HOLD THEM HARMLESS FROM AND
AGAINST (BUT LIMITED TO SUCH LENDERS PRO RATA PART OF) ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS, SUITS, COSTS, REASONABLE EXPENSES, AND REASONABLE DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY KIND O

benefits, and privileges (including the exculpatory and
indemnification provisions) of this Section 13 and of Section 8.13 shall apply to each such sub-agent and to the Affiliates of each such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities as sub-agent as
if such sub-agent and Affiliates were named herein. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to each sub-agent appointed by the Administrative Agent and/or an Appointing Sub-Agent, (i) such sub-agent shall be a third party
beneficiary under this Agreement with respect to all such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) and shall have all of the rights and benefits of a third party beneficiary, 
  66 



including an independent right of action to enforce such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) directly, without the consent or joinder of
any other Person, against any or all of the Companies and Lenders, (ii) such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) shall not be modified or amended without the consent of such sub-agent,
and (iii) such sub-agent shall only have obligations to Administrative Agent and, if applicable, an Appointing Sub-Agent and not to any Company, Lender or any other Person and no Company, Lender or any other Person shall have any rights,
directly or indirectly, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise, against such sub-agent; provided, that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) Administrative Agent shall remain solely responsible for the performance of its
obligations under the Loan Papers and for any actions and/or omissions by any agent and/or sub-agent of Administrative Agent and (ii) Administrative Agents Rights and obligations under the Loan Papers shall remain unchanged. 
13.7 Default; Collateral. If Administrative Agent receives notice of a Default from Borrower or any Lender, Administrative Agent shall
notify Lenders of such Default and Lenders agree to promptly confer in order that Majority Lenders or Lenders, as the case may be, may agree upon a course of action for the enforcement of the Rights of Lenders. Unless and until Administrative Agent
receives directions from Majority Lenders, Administrative Agent shall refrain from taking any action (without incurring any liability to any Person for so refraining), provided that, unless and until the Administrative Agent has received such
directions, the Administrative Agent may, at its option, take such actions as it deems appropriate without the direction of the Majority Lenders in circumstances where the ability of Lenders to recover the Obligation may otherwise be materially
impaired. In actions with respect to any property of Borrower, Administrative Agent is acting for the ratable benefit of each Lender. Administrative Agent shall hold, for the ratable benefit of all Lenders, any security it receives for the
Obligation or any guaranty of the Obligation it receives upon or in lieu of foreclosure.  13.8 Limitation of Liability. No Lender
or any Participant will incur any liability to any other Lender or Participant except for acts or omissions in bad faith, and neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender or Participant will incur any liability to any other Person for any act or
omission of any other Lender or any Participant.  13.9 Relationship of Lenders. The Loan Papers, and the documents delivered in
connection therewith, do not create a partnership or joint venture among Administrative Agent and Lenders or among Lenders.  13.10
Other Agents. None of the Lenders identified on the cover page or signature pages of this Agreement or otherwise herein as being the Syndication Agent or a Documentation Agent (collectively, the Other
Agents) shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Other
Agents in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or refraining from taking any action hereunder or pursuant hereto. 
  67 


13.11 Collateral Matters. 
(a) Each Lender authorizes and directs Administrative Agent to enter into the Security Documents for the ratable benefit of
Lenders. Each Lender agrees that any action taken by Administrative Agent concerning any Collateral with the consent of, or at the request of, Majority Lenders in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Security Documents or the other
Loan Papers, and the exercise by Administrative Agent (with the consent of, or at the request of, Majority Lenders) of powers concerning the Collateral set forth in any Loan Paper, together with other reasonably incidental powers, shall be
authorized and binding upon all Lenders.  (b) Administrative Agent is authorized on behalf of all Lenders, without the
necessity of any notice to or further consent from any Lender, from time to time before a Default or Potential Default, to take any action with respect to any Collateral or Security Documents that may be necessary to perfect and maintain perfected
the Lender Liens upon the Collateral granted by the Security Documents.  (c) Administrative Agent has no obligation
whatsoever to any Lender or to any other Person to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any Company or is cared for or protected. 
(d) Administrative Agent shall exercise the same care and prudent judgment with respect to the Collateral and the Security
Documents as it normally and customarily exercises in respect of similar collateral and security documents.  (e) Lenders
irrevocably authorize Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lender Lien upon any Collateral (i) upon full payment of the Obligation; (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed of as permitted
under Section 9.10, if Administrative Agent determines that the property being sold or disposed is being sold or disposed in accordance with the requirements and limitations of Section 9.10 and Administrative
Agent concurrently receives all mandatory prepayments with respect thereto, if any, in accordance with Section 9.10; (iii) constituting property in which no Company owned any interest at the time the Lender Lien was granted
or at any time thereafter; (iv) constituting property leased to any Company under a lease that has expired or been terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement or is about to expire and that has not been, and is not intended by
that Company to be, renewed; (v) consisting of an instrument evidencing Debt pledged to Administrative Agent (for the benefit of Lenders), if the Debt evidenced thereby has been paid in full; or (vi) if approved, authorized or ratified in
writing by Majority Lenders subject to Section 14.10(b)(v). Upon request by Administrative Agent at any time, Lenders will confirm in writing Administrative Agents authority to release particular types or items of Collateral
under this Section 13.11(e).  13.12 No Reliance on Administrative Agents Customer Identification Program.
Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that neither such Lender, nor any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees, may rely on the Administrative Agent to carry out such Lenders, Affiliates, participants or assignees
customer identification program, or other obligations required or imposed under or pursuant to the USA Patriot Act or the regulations thereunder, including the regulations contained in 31 CFR 103.121 (as hereafter amended or replaced, the
CIP Regulations), or any other Anti-Terrorism Law, including any programs involving any of the following items relating to or in connection with the Companies or their respective Subsidiaries, any of their respective
Affiliates or agents, the Loan Papers or the transactions hereunder: (a) any identity verification procedures, (b) any record keeping, (c) any comparisons with government lists, (d) any customer notices or (e) any other
procedures required under the CIP Regulations or such other laws. 
  68 


13.13 USA Patriot Act. Each Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender that is not
organized under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (and is not excepted from the certification requirement contained in Section 313 of the USA Patriot Act and the applicable regulations because it is both (a) an
affiliate of a depository institution or foreign bank that maintains a physical presence in the United States or foreign country, and (b) subject to supervision by a banking authority regulating such affiliated depository institution or foreign
bank) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the certification, or, if applicable, recertification, certifying that such Lender is not a shell and certifying to other matters as required by Section 313 of the USA Patriot Act and
the applicable regulations: (i) within 10 days after the Closing Date, and (ii) at such other times as are required under the USA Patriot Act. 
13.14 Credit Bidding. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, based upon the instruction of the Majority
Lenders, to credit bid and purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the UCC, including pursuant to Sections 9-610 or 9-620
thereof, at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code (including Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code) or any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law (whether domestic or foreign) now or
hereafter in effect, or at any sale or foreclosure conducted by the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with applicable law. 
13.15 Benefits of Agreement. None of the provisions of this Section 13 (other than Section 13.1 hereof) inure
to the benefit of any Company or any other Person other than Administrative Agent and Lenders; consequently, no Company or any other Person is entitled to rely upon, or to raise as a defense, in any manner whatsoever, the failure of Administrative
Agent or any Lender to comply with these provisions.  SECTION 14. MISCELLANEOUS. 
14.1 Headings. The headings, captions and arrangements used in any of the Loan Papers are, unless specified otherwise, for convenience

Nonbusiness Days; Time. Any payment or action that is due under any Loan Paper on a non-Business Day may be delayed until the next-succeeding Business Day (but interest shall continue to accrue on any applicable payment until payment is in
fact made) unless the payment concerns a LIBOR Rate Borrowing, in which case if the next-succeeding Business Day is in the next calendar month, then such payment shall be made on the next-preceding Business Day. Unless otherwise indicated, all time
references (e.g., 10:00 a.m.) are to New York, New York time. 
  69 


14.3 Communications and Posting of Approved Electronic Communications. 
(a) Unless otherwise specifically provided, 

tion must be in writing (which may be by telex or facsimile) to be effective and shall be deemed to have been given (i) if by telex, when transmitted to the appropriate telex
number and the appropriate answerback is received; (ii) if by facsimile, when transmitted to the appropriate facsimile number (and all communications sent by facsimile must be confirmed promptly thereafter by telephone; but any requirement in
this parenthetical shall not affect the date when the facsimile shall be deemed to have been delivered); (iii) if by mail, on the third Business Day after it is enclosed in an envelope and properly addressed, stamped, sealed, certified mail,
return receipt requested, and deposited in the appropriate official postal service; or (iv) if by any other means, when actually delivered. Until changed by notice pursuant to this Agreement, the address (and facsimile number) for each party to
a Loan Paper is set forth on the attached Schedule 1.  (b) Notices and other communications to Lenders and
Administrative Agent hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by Administrative Agent, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to
notices to any Lender pursuant to Section 2 if such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Section by electronic communication. Administrative Agent or Borrower may, in
its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it, provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.
Unless Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the senders receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the
return receipt requested function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), provided that if such notice or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or
communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next business day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt
by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor. 
(c) Delivery of Communications. Each Company hereby agrees, unless directed otherwise by the Administrative Agent or
unless the electronic mail address referred to below has not been provided by the Administrative Agent to such Company that it will, or will cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to the Administrative Agent all information, documents and other
materials that it is obligated to furnish to the Administrative Agent or to the Lenders pursuant to the Loan Papers, including all notices, requests, financial statements, financial and other reports, certificates and other information materials,
but excluding any such communication that (i) is or relates to a Borrowing Request or a notice of continuation or conversion, (ii) relates to the payment of any principal or other amount due under this Agreement prior to the scheduled date
therefor, (iii) provides notice of any Default under this Agreement or any other Loan Paper or (iv) is required to be delivered to satisfy any condition 
  70 



precedent to the effectiveness of this Agreement and/or any Borrowing or other extension of credit hereunder (all such non-excluded communications being referred to herein collectively as
Communications), by transmitting the Communications in an electronic/soft medium that is properly identified in a format acceptable to the Administrative Agent to an electronic mail address as directed by the Administrative
Agent in writing. In addition, each Company agrees, and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries, to continue to provide the Communications to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, as the case may be, in the manner specified in the Loan Papers but only
to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent.  (d) Platform. Each Company further agrees that Administrative
Agent may make the Communications available to the Lenders by posting the Communications on SyndTrak or a substantially similar electronic transmission system (the Platform). The Borrower hereby acknowledges that certain of
the Lenders (each, a Public Lender) may have personnel who do not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its Affiliates, or the respective securities of any of the foregoing, and who
may be engaged in investment and other market-related activities with respect to such Persons securities. The Borrower hereby agrees that so long as the Borrower is the issuer of any outstanding Debt or Equity Interests that are registered or
issued pursuant to a private offering or is actively contemplating issuing any such securities, it will, upon request, use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Administrative Agent in identifying that portion of the Communications that may
be distributed to the Public Lenders and that (1) all such Communications shall be clearly and conspicuously marked PUBLIC which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word PUBLIC shall appear prominently on the first page
thereof; (2) by marking Communications PUBLIC, the Borrower shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent, any Affiliate thereof, and the Lenders to treat such Communications as not containing any material non-public
information (although it may be sensitive and proprietary) with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States federal and state securities laws (provided, however, that to the extent such Communications
constitute Confidential Information, they shall be treated as set forth in Section 14.14); (3) all Communications marked PUBLIC are permitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform designated
Public Side Information; and (4) the Administrative Agent and the any Affiliate thereof and the Arranger shall be entitled to treat any Communications that are not marked PUBLIC as being suitable only for posting on a
portion of the Platform not designated Public Side Information.  (e) No Warranties as to Platform. THE
PLATFORM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE. THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR
OMISSIONS IN THE COMMUNICATIONS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY 

IED PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS OR THE PLATFORM. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY LENDER OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER OR NOT BASED ON STRICT
LIABILITY AND INCLUDING DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTS TRANSMISSION OF COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET,
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE LIABILITY OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTIES IS FOUND IN A FINAL, NON-APPEALABLE ORDER BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO HAVE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM SUCH INDEMNITEES GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. 
  71 


(f) Delivery Via Platform. The Administrative Agent agrees that the
receipt of the Communications by the Administrative Agent at its electronic mail address set forth above shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to the Administrative Agent for purposes of the Loan Papers. Each Lender agrees that
receipt of notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that the Communications have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such Lender for purposes of the Loan Papers. Each Lender
agrees to notify the Administrative Agent in writing (including by electronic communication) from time to time of such Lenders electronic mail address to which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and that the foregoing
notice may be sent to such electronic mail address.  (g) No Prejudice to Notice Rights. Nothing herein shall
prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to give any notice or other communication pursuant to any Loan Paper in any other manner specified in such Loan Paper. 
14.4 Form and Number of Documents. The form, substance, and number of counterparts of each writing to be furnished under this Agreement
must be satisfactory to Administrative Agent and its counsel.  14.5 Exceptions to Covenants. Borrower may not and may not permit
any Company to take or fail to take any action that is permitted as an exception to any of the covenants contained in any Loan Paper if that action or omission would result in the breach of any other covenant contained in any Loan Paper. 
14.6 Survival. All covenants, agreements, undertakings, representations, and warranties made in any of the Loan Papers survive all
closings under the Loan Papers and, except as otherwise indicated, are not affected by any investigation made by any party.  14.7
Governing Law. Except as expressly provided in a Loan Paper, the Laws (other than conflict-of-laws provisions) of the State of New York and of the United States of America govern the Rights and duties of the parties to the Loan Papers and the
validity, construction, enforcement, and interpretation of the Loan Papers.  14.8 Invalid Provisions. Any provision in any Loan
Paper held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable is fully severable; the appropriate Loan Paper shall be construed and enforced as if that provision had never been included; and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and
shall not be affected by the severed provision. Administrative Agent, Lenders, and each Company party to the affected Loan Paper agree to negotiate, in good faith, the terms of a replacement provision as similar to the severed provision as may be
possible and be legal, valid, and enforceable. However, if the provision held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable is a material part of this Agreement, such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision shall be, to the extent permitted by Law,
replaced by a clause or provision judicially construed and interpreted to be as similar in substance and content to the original terms of such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable clause or provision as the context thereof would reasonably allow, so
that such clause or provision would thereafter be legal, valid and enforceable. 
  72 


14.9 Venue; Service of Process; Jury Trial. EACH PARTY TO ANY LOAN PAPER, IN EACH CASE FOR
ITSELF, ITS SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS (AND IN THE CASE OF BORROWER, FOR EACH OTHER COMPANY), (a) IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF TH

Y THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, POSTAGE PREPAID, BY HAND-DELIVERY, OR BY DELIVERY BY A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED COURIER SERVICE, AND
SERVICE SHALL BE DEEMED COMPLETE UPON DELIVERY OF THE LEGAL PROCESS AT ITS ADDRESS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT; (e) IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST ANY PARTY TO ANY LOAN PAPER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN
PAPERS OR THE OBLIGATION MAY BE BROUGHT IN ONE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS; AND (f) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF
ANY LOAN PAPER. The scope of each of the foregoing waivers is intended to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in any court and that relate to the subject matter of this transaction, including, without limitation, contract
claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims, and all other common law and statutory claims. Borrower (for itself and on behalf of each other Company) acknowledges that these waivers are a material inducement to Administrative Agents and each
Lenders agreement to enter into a business relationship, that Administrative Agent and each Lender have already relied on these waivers in entering into this Agreement, and that Administrative Agent and each Lender will continue to rely on
each of these waivers in related future dealings. Borrower (for itself and on behalf of each other Company) further warrants and represents that it has reviewed these waivers with its legal counsel and that it knowingly and voluntarily agrees to
each waiver following consultation with legal counsel. THE WAIVERS IN THIS SECTION 14.9 ARE IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT THEY MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THESE WAIVERS SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS,
SUPPLEMENTS, OR REPLACEMENTS TO OR OF THIS OR ANY OTHER LOAN PAPER. In the event of Litigation, this Agreement may be filed as a written consent to a trial by the court. 
  73 


14.10 Amendments, Consents, Conflicts, and Waivers. 
(a) Unless otherwise specifically provided, (i) this Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in writing executed by
Borrower, Administrative Agent and Majority Lenders and supplemented only by documents delivered or to be delivered in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement and (ii) the other Loan Papers may only be the subject of an amendment,
modification, or waiver that has been approved by Majority Lenders and Borrower.  (b) Any amendment, consent or waiver
under this Agreement or any Loan Paper that purports to accomplish any of the following must be in writing and executed by Borrower and Administrative Agent and executed (or approved, as the case may be) by each Lender: (i) extend the due date
or decrease the amount of any scheduled payment of the Obligation beyond the date specified in the Loan Papers; (ii) decrease any rate or amount of interest, fees, or other sums payable to Administrative Agent or Lenders under this Agreement
(except such reductions as are contemplated by this Agreement); (iii) change the definition of Applicable Margin, Commitment Usage, Committed Sum,
Facility Committed Sum, Majority Lenders or Facility Maturity Date; (iv) increase or decrease any one or more Lenders Committed Sums except as provided in this
Agreement; (v) except as permitted by Section 9.10, consent to the release of all or substantially all of the Collateral under the Security Documents; (vi) change the provisions of Section 13 to the
detriment of any Lender; (vii) change any provision requiring ratable distributions to Lenders; (viii) subject any Lender to a greater obligation than expressly provided in this Agreement; or (ix) change this clause (b) or any
other matter specifically requiring the consent of all Lenders under this Agreement.  (c) Any conflict or ambiguity between
the terms and provisions of this Agreement and terms and provisions in any other Loan Paper is controlled by the terms and provisions of this Agreement. 
(d) No course of dealing or any failure or delay by Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any of their respective
Representatives with respect to exercising any Right of Administrative Agent or any Lender under this Agreement operates as a waiver thereof. A waiver must be in writing and signed by Administrative Agent and Lenders (or Majority Lenders, if
permitted under this Agreement) to be effective, and a waiver will be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it is given. 
14.11 Multiple Counterparts. Any Loan Paper may be executed in a number of identical counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original for all purposes and all of which constitute, collectively, one agreement; but, in making proof of thereof, it shall not be necessary to produce or account for more than one counterpart. Each Lender need not execute the same counterpart of
this Agreement so long as identical counterparts are executed by Borrower, each Lender, and Administrative Agent. This Agreement shall become effective when counterparts of this Agreement have been executed and delivered to Administrative Agent by
each Lender, Administrative Agent and Borrower. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging (including in .pdf format) means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement. 
  74 


14.12 Successors and Assigns; Participations. 
(a) Each Loan Paper binds and inures to the benefit of the parties thereto, any intended beneficiary thereof, and each of their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No Lender may transfer, pledge, assign, sell any participation in, or otherwise encumber its portion of the Obligation except as permitted by this Section 14.12. 
(b) Subject to the provisions of this Section and in accordance with applicable Law, any Lender may, in the ordinary course of
its commercial banking business, at any time sell to one or more Persons that is not a Company or an Affiliate of a Company (each a Participant) participating interests in its portion of the Obligation. The selling Lender
shall remain a Lender under this Agreement (and the Participant shall not constitute a Lender under this Agreement) and its obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged. The selling Lender shall remain solely
responsible for the performance of its obligations under the Loan Papers and shall remain the holder of its share of the Principal Debt for all purposes under this Agreement. Borrower and Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and
directly with the selling Lender in connection with that Lenders Rights and obligations under the Loan Papers. Participants have no Rights under the Loan Papers, other than certain voting Rights as provided below. Subject to the following,
each Lender may obtain (on behalf of its Participants) the benefits of Section 3 with respect to all participations in its part of the Obligation outstanding from time to time so long as Borrower is not obligated to pay any amount
in excess of the amount that would be due to that Lender under Section 3 calculated as though no participations have been made. No Lender may sell any participating interest under which the Participant has any Rights to approve
any amendment, modification or waiver of any Loan Paper, except to the extent the amendment, modification or waiver extends the due date for payment of any principal, interest or fees due under the Loan Papers, reduces the interest rate or the
amount of principal or fees applicable to the Obligation (except reductions contemplated by this Agreement), or releases a material portion of the Collateral, if any, for the Obligation (other than releases of collateral permitted by
Section 13.11(e)). However, if a Participant is entitled to the benefits of Section 3 or a Lender grants Rights to its Participants to approve amendments to or waivers of the Loan Papers respecting the matters
described in the previous sentence, then that Lender must include a voting mechanism in the relevant participation agreement whereby a majority of its portion of the Obligation (whether held by it or participated) shall control the vote for all of
that Lenders portion of the Obligation. Except in the case of the sale of a participating interest to another Lender, the relevant participation agreement shall prohibit the Participant from transferring, pledging, assigning, selling
participations in, or otherwise encumbering its portion of the Obligation.  (c) Subject to the provisions of this Section,
any Lender may at any time, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking business, (i) without the consent of Borrower or Administrative Agent, assign all or any part of its Rights and obligations under the Loan Papers to any of its
Affiliates or any other Lender (each a Purchaser) and (ii) upon the prior written consent of Borrower and Administrative Agent (which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), assign to any other Person that is
not (A) a Company or an Affiliate of a Company or (B) a business competitor of any Company (each of which is also a Purchaser) a proportionate part (not less than the greater of (x) $5,000,000 or (y) its

  75 



remaining balance, and an integral multiple of $1,000,000) of all or any part of its Rights and obligations under the Loan Papers; provided, however, that such assigning Lender must retain an
obligation hereunder to fund at least $10,000,000 of the Facility, unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower and Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In each case, the Purchaser shall assume those Rights and
obligations under an assignment agreement substantially in the form of the attached Exhibit G. Each assignment under this Section 14.12(c) shall include a ratable interest in the assigning Lenders Rights and obligations
under the Facility. Upon (i) delivery to Borrower and Administrative Agent (A) of an assignment agreement electronically executed and delivered via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent or (B) an
assignment agreement manually executed and (ii) payment of a fee of $3,500 from the transferee to Administrative Agent, from and after the assignments effective date (which shall be after the date of delivery), the Purchaser shall for all
purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and shall have all the Rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement to the same extent as if it were an original party to this Agreement with commitments as set forth in the assignment
agreement, and the transferor Lender shall be released from its obligations under this Agreement to a corresponding extent, and, except as provided in the following sentence, no further consent or action by Borrower, Lenders or Administrative Agent
shall be required. Upon the consummation of any transfer to a Purchaser under this clause (c), the then-existing Schedule 1 shall automatically be deemed to reflect the name, address, and Committed Sum of such Purchaser, Borrower shall
execute and deliver to each of the transferor Lender and the Purchaser a Facility Note in the face amount of its respective Committed Sum under the Facility following transfer, and, upon receipt of its new Facility Note, the transferor Lender shall
return to Borrower the Facility Note previously delivered to it under this Agreement. A Purchaser is subject to all the provisions in this Section as if it were a Lender signatory to this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement. 
(d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of Borrower or Administrative Agent, assign all or any part of its Rights
under the Loan Papers to a Federal Reserve Bank without releasing the transferor Lender from its obligations thereunder. 
(e) The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in any assignment
agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based
recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any
other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.  14.13 Discharge Only Upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement in
Certain Circumstances. Each Companys obligations under the Loan Papers remain in full force and effect until the Facility Committed Sum is terminated and the Obligation (other than unasserted contingent obligations) is paid in full (except
for provisions under the Loan Papers which by their terms expressly survive payment of the Obligation and termination of the Loan Papers). If at any time any payment of the principal of or interest on any Note or any other amount payable by Borrower
or any other obligor on the Obligation under any Loan Paper is rescinded or must be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower or otherwise, the obligations of each Company under the Loan Papers with respect
to that payment shall be reinstated as though the payment had been due but not made at that time.

14.14 Confidentiality. Borrower, Administrative Agent, Arranger and Lenders agree to keep
all information concerning the structure and documentation of this Agreement confidential, including without limitation all information of a confidential nature received by them from Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that such
information may be disclosed: (a) to directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, or outside counsel of Borrower or of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender; (b) to any auditor, government
official, or examiner (including, without limitation, any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners); (c) pursuant to any subpoena or other order of any court or administrative agency or otherwise as
may be required by applicable law, rule, or regulation; (d) to any other Person if reasonably incidental to the administration of the credit facility provided herein; (e) in connection with any litigation to which such Lender or any of its
Affiliates may be a party; (f) to the extent necessary in connection with the exercise of any remedy under this Agreement or any other Loan Paper; (g) subject to provisions substantially similar to those contained in this
Section 14.14 to any actual or proposed participant or assignee; or (h) to any assignee of or participant in, or prospective assignee of or participant in, any Lenders Borrowings or its Committed Sum or any part thereof
under any credit agreement who, in each case set forth in clauses (a) through (h), agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Section; and provided further, that no confidentiality obligation shall attach to any information which
(1) is or becomes publicly known, through no wrongful act on the part of any Person who shall have received such information, (2) is rightfully received by such Person from a third party, (3) is independently developed by such Person,
or (4) is explicitly approved for release by Borrower.  14.15 Entirety. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER WRITTEN LOAN PAPERS (EACH
AS AMENDED IN WRITING FROM TIME TO TIME) EXECUTED BY ANY COMPANY, ANY LENDER, OR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE COMPANIES, LENDERS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS BY THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES.  14.16
Government Regulations; USA Patriot Act.  (a) Borrower shall (i) ensure that no Person who owns a controlling
interest in or otherwise controls Borrower is or shall be listed on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person List or other similar lists maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the Department
of the Treasury or included in any Executive Orders of the President of the United States of America (Executive Orders), that prohibits or limits Lenders from making any advance or extension of credit to Borrower or from
otherwise conducting business with Borrower, and (ii) ensure that the proceeds of the Borrowings shall not be used to violate any of the foreign asset control regulations of OFAC or any enabling statute or Executive Order relating thereto.
Further, Borrower shall comply, and cause its Subsidiaries to comply, with all applicable Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) laws and regulations, as amended. 
  77 


(b) Each of Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby notifies Borrower that,
pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies Borrower, which information includes the name and address of Borrower and its Subsidiaries and other information that will
allow Administrative Agent and such Lender to identify Borrower and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the USA Patriot Act.  14.17 No
Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Paper), Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by Lenders are arms-length commercial transactions between Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Lenders, on the other hand,
(B) Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Papers; (ii) (A) each Lender is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be
acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) no Lender has any obligation to Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those
obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Papers; and (iii) each Lender and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of Borrower and its
Affiliates, and no Lender has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to Borrower or its Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against any Lender with respect to
any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby  14.18
California. If any action or proceeding is filed in a court of the State of California by or against any party hereto or to any other Loan Papers in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Papers,
(a) the court shall, and is hereby directed to, make a general reference pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 638 to a referee (who shall be a single active or retired judge) to hear and determine all of the issues in
such action or proceeding (whether of fact or of law) and to report a statement of decision, provided that at the option of any party to such proceeding, any such issues pertaining to a provisional remedy as defined in California Code of
Civil Procedure Section 1281.8 shall be heard and determined by the court, and (b) subject to Section 8.7, the Borrower shall be solely responsible to pay all reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any referee
