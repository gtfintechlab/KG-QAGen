consistent with the historical practices of the parties to this Agreement (or, if the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that
adoption of any portion of such historical practice is not administratively feasible, market practice (or, if the Administrative Agent
decides that adoption of any portion of such market practice is not administratively feasible or if the Administrative Agent determines

the case of clause (c) of the definition of “Benchmark Transition Event”, the first date on which such Benchmark
(or the published component used in the calculation thereof) has been determined and announced by or on behalf of the administrator of
such Benchmark (or such component thereof) or the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component thereof)
to be non-representative or non-compliant with or non-aligned with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles
for Financial Benchmarks; provided that such non-representativeness, non-compliance or non-alignment will be determined by reference
to the most recent statement or publication referenced in such clause (c) and even if any Available Tenor of such Benchmark
(or such component thereof) continues to be provided on such date.
 
For the avoidance of doubt,
the “Benchmark Replacement Date” will be deemed to have occurred in the case of clause (a) or (b)
with respect to any Benchmark upon the occurrence of the applicable event or events set forth therein with respect to all then-current
Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof).
 
“Benchmark Transition
Event” means the occurrence of one or more of the following events with respect to the then-current Benchmark:

no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof);
 
(b)           a
public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the
published component used in the calculation thereof), the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, an insolvency
official with jurisdiction over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component), a resolution authority with jurisdiction

THE CREDITS
 
Section
2.01       Commitments.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions
and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, to make to Borrower
one or more Revolving Loans in US Dollars at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period in accordance with the terms
hereof, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result after giving effect to any Revolving Borrowing in
such Lender’s Revolving Exposure exceeding such Lender’s Revolving Commitment.
 
Subject to the terms, conditions
and limitations set forth herein, Borrower may borrow, pay or prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.
 
Section
2.02       Loans.
 
(a)           Each
Revolving Loan shall be made as part of a Revolving Borrowing consisting of Revolving Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance
with their respective Revolving Commitments; provided that the failure of any Lender to make a Revolving Loan shall not in itself
relieve any other Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Lender to make any Revolving Loan required to be made by such other Lender).
 
(b)           Subject
to Section 2.11, Section 2.12, and Section 2.13, each Revolving Borrowing shall be denominated
in US Dollars and comprised entirely of ABR Loans or SOFR Loans as Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.03.
 
(i)                
ABR Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is (A) an integral multiple of US$1,000,000 and not less than US$1,000,000
or (B) equal to the remaining available balance of the aggregate Revolving Commitments; and
 
(ii)             
SOFR Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is (A) an integral multiple of US$1,000,000 and not less than
US$5,000,000 or (B) equal to the remaining available balance of the aggregate Revolving Commitments.
 
(c)           Each
Lender may at its option make any SOFR Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such SOFR Loan;
provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, or create any enhanced rights in the Administrative Agent or any Lender under this Agreement, including under
Section 2.13, 2.18 and 10.03, that are additional to or more favorable than the rights thereof
had such option not been exercised. Revolving Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that
Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Revolving Borrowing that, if made, would result in more than fifteen (15) SOFR Borrowings
outstanding hereunder at any one time. For purposes of the foregoing, Revolving Borrowings having different Interest Periods, regardless
of whether they commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Borrowings.
 


46
 

 
(d)           Each
Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such account in New York City as the Administrative Agent may designate not later than 1:00 pm, New York time. The Administrative Agent
shall promptly credit the amounts so received from Lenders to an account as directed by Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request
delivered to or maintained with the Administrative Agent or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition precedent
specified in Article IV shall not have been met, return the amounts so received to the respective Lenders.
 
(e)           Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date (in the case of any SOFR Borrowing), and at least
2 hours prior to the time (in the case of any ABR Borrowing), of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative
Agent such Lender’s ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made its ratable
portion available to the Administrative Agent at the time of such Borrowing in accordance with clause (d) above, and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If the Administrative
Agent shall have so made funds available, then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made its ratable portion of such Borrowing
available to the Administrative Agent, each of such Lender and Borrower severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith
on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to Borrower
until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at in the case of Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time
to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined
by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative
Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement, and Borrower’s obligation to repay the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount pursuant to this Section
2.02(e) shall cease. If Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping
period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to Borrower the amount of such interest paid by Borrower for such period. Any payment
by Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to
the Administrative Agent.
 
(f)            Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Borrowing if
the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date.

(b)           the requested date of such Revolving Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(c)           whether

(d)           in
the case of SOFR Loans, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition

(f)            that the conditions set forth in Sections 4.02(b)-(g) as applicable, have been satisfied as of the date of

If no election as to the denomination
or Type of Loans is specified, then the requested Revolving Borrowing shall be deemed to be for SOFR Loans with an Interest Period of
one month’s duration. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested SOFR Loan, the Borrower shall be deemed to
have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request, in accordance with
this Section 2.03, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s
Pro Rata Percentage of the Loans to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

records including (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto; (ii) the amount
of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount
of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof. The entries
made in the records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender pursuant to this paragraph shall be prima facie evidence
of the existence and amounts of the obligations therein recorded; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative
Agent to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligations of the Borrowers to repay the Loans
in accordance with their terms. In the event of any conflict between the records maintained by any Lender and the records of the Administrative
Agent in respect of such matters, the records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. After a request
by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly advise Borrower of such entries made in such records.
 


48
 

 
(c)           Promissory
Notes. Any Lender by written notice to Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) may request that Loans made by it to Borrower
be evidenced by a Note. In such event, Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to such Lender or its
registered assigns in the form of Exhibit F-1 or F-2, as the case may be. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced

in immediately available funds in US Dollars, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate, among the Lenders.

Equivalent thereof) equal to the Applicable Margin for SOFR Borrowings from time to time in effect during such quarter
(provided, however, that with respect to Performance Letters of Credit, such Applicable Margin shall be multiplied by
0.50), multiplied by the average daily amount of the aggregate L/C Exposure during such quarter calculated on the basis of a 360 day
year and actual days elapsed. In addition, Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Bank solely for such Issuing Bank’s account, in
connection with each Letter of Credit, (1) such Issuing Bank’s standard issuance and administrative fees and expenses for
Letters of Credit issued by it and (2) a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the average daily
amount of the L/C Obligations in respect of such Letter of Credit calculated on the basis of a 360 day year and actual days elapsed
and shall be payable to such Issuing Bank, for its own account, in the applicable Accepted Currency in which such Letter(s) of
Credit is/are denominated (or, if relating to a Letter of Credit denominated in a Discretionary Foreign Currency, in the Dollar
Equivalent thereof), quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day following of each March, June, September and December of each
year.
 
(d)           Once
paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.

on Loans.
 
(a)           ABR
Loans. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.06(c), each Revolving Loan, during the period such Revolving Loan is
an ABR Loan, shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable
Margin in effect from time to time.
 
(b)           SOFR
Loans. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.06(c), each Revolving Loan, during the period such Revolving Loan is
a SOFR Loan, shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Revolving Loan to the Adjusted
Term SOFR in effect therefor plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time.
 
(c)           Default Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount
payable by Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to in the case of
amounts constituting principal on any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs
of this Section 2.06 or in the case of any other outstanding amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as
provided in Section 2.06(a) (the “Default Rate”).
 
(d)          Interest Payment Dates. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable by the Borrower in arrears on each Interest
Payment Date for such Loan; provided that interest accrued pursuant to Section 2.06(c) shall be payable on demand,
in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of a ABR Loan without a permanent reduction in the applicable
Revolving Commitments), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment
and in the event of any conversion of any SOFR Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such
SOFR Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
 
(e)           Interest Calculation. All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest
computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and
in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable
Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted Term SOFR shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(f)            Currency
for Payment of Interest. All interest paid or payable on Loans hereunder shall be paid in the currency in which such Loan is denominated.

and Reduction of Commitments.
 
(a)           Termination
of Commitments. The Revolving Commitments shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date.
 
(b)           Optional Terminations and Reductions. At its option, Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time permanently
reduce, the Revolving Commitments; provided that each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral
multiple of US$1,000,000 and not less than US$5,000,000 and the Revolving Commitments shall not be terminated or reduced if, after giving
effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the aggregate amount of Revolving
Exposures would exceed the aggregate amount of Revolving Commitments, except, in the case of L/C Obligations, to the extent the Borrower
Cash Collateralizes such L/C Obligations or furnishes to the applicable Issuing Bank(s) “back-to-back” letters of credit from
bank(s) or financial institution(s) whose short-term unsecured debt rating is rated A-3 (or equivalent) or above from either S&P or
Moody’s or such other bank(s) or financial institution(s) satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Banks in an amount equal to 105%
of the undrawn face amount of any applicable outstanding Letters of Credit with an expiration date of at least five (5) days after the
expiration date of any applicable Letter of Credit and which provide that such Issuing Bank may make a drawing under such “back-to-back”
letter of credit in the event that it pays a drawing under such Letter of Credit.
 
(c)           Borrower Notice. The Borrower shall notify in writing the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce
the Revolving Commitments under Section 2.08(b) at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination
or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice with respect to Revolving
Commitments, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by Borrower pursuant to
this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of any of the Commitments delivered by Borrower may state
that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of another credit facility or the closing of a securities offering, in which case
such notice may be revoked by Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent, who promptly agrees to provide a copy of such notice to
the Lenders, on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of any of the
Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be made ratably among the Revolving Lenders in accordance
with their respective Revolving Commitments.
 
Section
2.09       Interest
Elections.
 
(a)           Generally.
Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the
case of a SOFR Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may
elect to convert all or a portion of such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue all or a portion of such Borrowing and, in
the case of a SOFR Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.09. Borrower may
elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be
allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be
considered a separate Borrowing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Borrower shall not be entitled to request any conversion
or continuation that, if made, would result in more than fifteen (15) SOFR Borrowings outstanding hereunder at any one time.
 


51
 

 
(b)           Interest
Election Notice. To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.09, the Borrower shall deliver, by hand delivery or
telecopier, a duly completed and executed Interest Election Request to the Administrative Agent not later than the time that a Borrowing
Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting Loans of the Type resulting from such election
to be made on the effective date of such election. Each Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable. Each Interest Election Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
 
(i)              the
Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions
thereof, or if outstanding Borrowings are being combined, the allocation to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to
be specified pursuant to clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting
Borrowing);
 
(ii)             
the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(iii)           
whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a SOFR Borrowing;
 
(iv)            if the resulting Borrowing is a SOFR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.
 
If any such Interest Election
Request requests a SOFR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest
Period of one month’s duration.
 
Promptly following receipt
of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s pro
rata portion of each resulting Borrowing.
 
(c)           Automatic
Conversion. If an Interest Election Request with respect to a SOFR Borrowing is not timely delivered prior to the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing
shall be continued as a SOFR Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month’s duration. Notwithstanding any contrary provision
hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing , the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may require, by notice
to Borrower, that (A) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a SOFR Borrowing and (B) unless repaid, each SOFR
Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
 


52
 

 
Section
2.10       Optional
and Mandatory Prepayments of Loans.
 
(a)           Optional
Prepayments. Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any applicable Borrowing, in whole or in part,
without premium or penalty subject to the requirements of this Section 2.10 and Section 2.16; provided
that each partial prepayment shall be in a minimum amount equal to the lesser of the minimum amount required pursuant to Section
2.02(b) for Borrowings of the Type of Loan to be repaid and such lesser amount as needed to prepay the entire outstanding principal
amount of such Borrowing.
 
(b)           Revolving Loan Prepayments:
 
(i)              
In the event of the termination of all the Revolving Commitments, Borrower shall, on the date of such termination, repay
or prepay all outstanding Revolving Borrowings (and if any Revolving Exposure shall remain as a result of L/C Exposures, the Borrower
shall fully Cash Collateralize 105% of such L/C Exposures).
 
(ii)             
In the event of any partial reduction of the Revolving Commitments, then (1) at or prior to the effective date of such reduction,
the Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower and the Revolving Lenders of the sum of the Revolving Exposures after giving effect thereto
and (2) if the sum of the Revolving Exposures would exceed the aggregate amount of Revolving Commitments after giving effect to such reduction,
then Borrower shall, on the date of such reduction, repay or prepay Revolving Borrowings, in an aggregate amount sufficient to eliminate
such excess (and if any such excess shall remain as a result of L/C Exposures, the Borrower shall fully Cash Collateralize such L/C Exposures).
 
(iii)           
In the event that the sum of all Lenders’ Revolving Exposures exceeds the Revolving Commitments then in effect, Borrower
shall, without notice or demand, immediately repay or prepay Revolving Borrowings (in whole or in part), in an aggregate amount sufficient
to eliminate such excess (and if any such excess shall remain as a result of L/C Exposures, the Borrower shall fully Cash Collateralize
such L/C Exposures).
 
(c)           [Reserved].
 
(d)           Application of Prepayments. Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment hereunder, the Borrower shall select the
applicable Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid in whole or in part and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment
pursuant to Section 2.10(e), subject to the provisions of this Section 2.10(d); provided:
 
(e)           
Notice of Prepayment:
 
(i)              Borrower
shall notify the Administrative Agent by written notice of any prepayment hereunder (A) in the case of prepayment of a SOFR Borrowing,
not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, three U.S. Government Securities Business Days before the date of prepayment, and (B) in the
case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the same Business Day as the date of prepayment.
 


53
 

 
(ii)             Each
such notice shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of prepayment delivered by Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned
upon the effectiveness of another credit facility or the closing of a securities offering, in which case such notice may be revoked by
Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified prepayment date) if such condition is not satisfied. Each
such notice shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case
of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment. Promptly following receipt of any such
notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be
in an amount that would be permitted in the case of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as
necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the
Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing and otherwise in accordance with this Section 2.10. Prepayments shall be accompanied
by accrued and unpaid interest to the extent required by Section 2.06 and any breakage payments to the extent required
by Section 2.16.
 
Section
2.11       Alternate
Rate of Interest.
 
(a)           If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a SOFR Borrowing:
 
(i)              the
Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be final and conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Term SOFR for such Interest Period; or
 
(ii)             the
Administrative Agent determines or is advised in writing by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted Term SOFR for such Interest Period
will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such SOFR Borrowing
for such Interest Period,
 
then the Administrative Agent shall give written
notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the
Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, any SOFR Borrowing requested to be made on
the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as a Market Disruption Loan, any Borrowing that was to have been converted on the
first day of such Interest Period to a SOFR Borrowing shall be continued as a Market Disruption Loan and any outstanding SOFR Borrowing
shall be automatically converted to a Market Disruption Loan.
 
Section
2.12       Benchmark
Replacement Setting.
 
(a)           Benchmark
Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark
Transition Event, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the then-current Benchmark with a
Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York
City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all affected Lenders
and the Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment
from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section
2.12(a) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.
 

54
 



 
(b)            
Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation
of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to
time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes
will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
 
(c)            
Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and
the Lenders of (i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (ii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection
with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the
Borrower of the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.12(d). Any determination, decision or election
that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.12, including
any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date
and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and
may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except,
in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.12.
 
(d)              
Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document,
at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term
rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information
service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the administrator
of such Benchmark or the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication
of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative or in compliance with or aligned with
the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks, then the Administrative Agent may
modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after
such time to remove such unavailable, non-representative, non-compliant or non-aligned tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant
to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a
Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative or in compliance
with or aligned with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks for a Benchmark
(including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or any
similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
 
(e)              
 Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark
Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a SOFR Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans
to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted
any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans. During a Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time
that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such
tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR.

Section
2.13       Yield
Protection.
 
(a)              
Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:
 
(i)             
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in, by any Lender (except any reserve requirement
reflected in the Adjusted Term SOFR);
 
(ii)             
subject any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement (except for (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B)
Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes, and (C) Connection Income
Taxes); or
 
(iii)           
impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this
Agreement or SOFR Loans made by such Lender,
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be
to increase the cost to such Lender of making, continuing, converting to or maintaining any SOFR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation
to make any such SOFR Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, or to reduce the amount
of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon written request
of such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b)             Capital
Requirements. If any Lender determines (in good faith, but in its sole absolute discretion) that any Change in Law affecting
such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity
requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such
Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such
Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in
Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to
capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time upon written request of such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent)
Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding
company for any such reduction suffered.
 


56
 

 
(c)              
Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate
such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in clause (a) or (b) of this Section
2.13 and delivered to Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due
on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
(d)              
Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section
2.13 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that Borrower shall
not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered
more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive
effect thereof).
 
(e)              
Mitigation. Each Lender requesting compensation under this Section 2.13 shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate, avoid, or eliminate the amount of any such increased costs in accordance with Section 2.19, so long
as taking such efforts would not be materially disadvantageous to such Lender or expose any Lender to an unreimbursed cost or expense.
 
Section
2.14       [Reserved].
 
Section
2.15       [Reserved].
 
Section
2.16       Breakage
Payments.
 
In the event of (a) the
payment or prepayment, whether optional or mandatory, of any principal of any SOFR Loan earlier than the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any SOFR Loan earlier than the last
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure (for a reason other than the failure of a Lender to fund a Loan
required to be funded hereunder) to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered by Borrower pursuant hereto or (d) the assignment of any SOFR Loan earlier than the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto as a result of a request by Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19(b), then, in any such event, upon
written demand by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), Borrower shall compensate such Lender for the loss, cost and
expense incurred by such Lender as a result of such event. In the case of a SOFR Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any such Lender
shall be deemed to include an amount reasonably determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest
which would have accrued on the principal amount of such SOFR Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted Term SOFR that would
have been applicable to such SOFR Loan for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest
Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest
Period for such SOFR Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the
interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable
amount and period from other banks in the relevant market. A certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any
amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, accompanied by related calculations, shall be
delivered to Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error. The
Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten days after receipt thereof.
 


57
 

 
Section
2.17       Payments
Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs.
 
(a)            
Payments Generally. The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan
Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or of amounts payable under Section 2.13, 2.18 or 10.03,
or otherwise) on or before the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or if no such time
is expressly required, prior to 2:00 p.m., New York time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction
or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent be deemed to have
been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made with respect
to Borrowings, to the Administrative Agent at its offices at Stamford, Connecticut, except that payments pursuant to Section 2.13,
2.18 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan
Documents shall be made to the persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for
the account of any other Lender Party to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document
shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, unless specified otherwise, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All
payments of principal and interest under each Loan Document shall be made in the currency in which the Loan is outstanding.
 
(b)              
Pro Rata Treatment:
 
(i)                
Each payment by Borrower of interest in respect of the Loans shall be applied to the amounts of such obligations owing to
the Lenders pro rata according to the respective amounts then due and owing to such Lenders.
 
(ii)             
Each payment by Borrower on account of principal of the Revolving Borrowings shall be made pro rata according to
the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Loans then held by such Revolving Lenders.
 
(iii)           
Each payment by the Borrower on account of Reimbursement Obligations shall be applied to the amounts of such obligations
owing to the Issuing Banks pro rata according to the respective amounts then due and owing to such Issuing Banks.
 


58
 

 
(c)              
 Insufficient Funds. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent
to pay fully all applicable amounts of principal, interest and fees that constitute Obligations then due hereunder, such funds shall be
applied (i) first, toward payment of applicable interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto
in accordance with the applicable amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, toward payment of applicable
principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the applicable amounts of principal then due
to such parties. It is understood that the foregoing does not apply to any adequate protection payments under any federal, state or foreign
bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding, and that each Administrative Agent may, subject to any applicable federal,
state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar orders, distribute any adequate protection payments it receives on behalf
of the applicable Lenders to such Lenders in its sole discretion (i.e., whether to pay the earliest accrued interest, all accrued
interest on a pro rata basis or otherwise).
 
(d)              
Sharing of Set-Off. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment
in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other Obligations resulting in such Lender’s receiving payment
of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other Obligations greater than its pro rata share
thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (i) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact,
and (ii) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other
adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with
the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:
 
(i)             
if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations
shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
 
(ii)             
the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by Borrower pursuant to and in
accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (B) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or
sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to Holdings or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which
the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
 
Each Loan Party consents to
the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Requirements of Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation
pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation. If under applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or any similar law any Beneficiary receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff or counterclaim to which this Section
2.17(d) applies, such Beneficiary shall to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner
consistent with the rights to which the Beneficiary is entitled under this Section 2.17(d) to share in the benefits of the
recovery of such secured claim.

 Borrower Default. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date on
which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment,
the Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon
such assumption, distribute to Lenders the amount due. In such event, if Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the
Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
Section
2.18       Taxes.
 
(a)              
Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of Loan Parties hereunder or under
any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable
Requirements of Law. If the applicable Withholding Agent shall be required by applicable Requirements of Law (as determined in the good
faith discretion of the applicable Withholding Agent) to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then the applicable Withholding
Agent shall be entitled to make such deductions or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable
by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after all required deductions or withholdings have been made (including
deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal
to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made.
 
(b)              
Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of clause (a) above, the Loan Parties
shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law, or at the option of the Administrative
Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes imposed on or with respect to any obligation of Borrower hereunder or under
any other Loan Document to which it is a party.
 
(c)               Indemnification
by Borrower. The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 20 days after written demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to
amounts payable under this Section) paid or payable by such Recipient, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by a Lender Party (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender Party, shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Recipient shall be indemnified for any Indemnified Taxes
hereunder unless the Recipient makes written demand on Borrower for such reimbursement no later than six months after the earlier of
(i) the date on which the relevant Governmental Authority makes written demand upon such Recipient for payment of such Indemnified
Taxes, and (ii) the date on which such Recipient has made payment of such Indemnified Taxes; provided that if the Indemnified
Taxes imposed or asserted giving rise to such claims are retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended
to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
 


60
 

 
(d)              
Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority
pursuant to this Section 2.18, the Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy
of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence
of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(e)              
Status of Lenders:
 
(i)                
Each Lender Party that is entitled to an exemption form or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under
any Loan Document shall deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender Party becomes a
Lender Party under this Agreement and at the time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly
completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law as will permit payments hereunder or under any other
Loan Document to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender Party, if reasonably requested
by Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law or reasonably
requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such
Lender Party is subject to information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences,
the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.18(e)(ii)(A),
(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion,
execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal
or commercial position of such Lender.
 
(ii)             
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
 
(A)            
any Lender Party that is a US Person shall deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as
shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender Party becomes a Lender Party under this Agreement (and
from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or the Administrative Agent), duly completed originals of IRS Form
W-9 (or applicable successor form) certifying that such Lender Party is exempt from US federal backup withholding Tax; and
 
(B)              any
Lender Party that is a Foreign Lender Party shall deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as
shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender Party becomes a Lender Party under this Agreement
(and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or the Administrative Agent), but only if such Lender
Party is legally entitled to do so, whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(1)              
in the case of such a Lender Party claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (a)
with respect to payments of interest hereunder or under any other Loan Document, duly completed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN (or applicable
successor form) or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or applicable successor form), as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, US
federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty, and (b) with respect to any other applicable
payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document, duly completed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN (or applicable successor form) or
IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or applicable successor form), as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, US federal withholding
Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;
 


61
 

 
(2)              
duly completed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor form);
 
(3)              
in the case of such a Lender Party claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of
the Code, (a) a certificate, in substantially the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such US Lender Party is not (i)
a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (ii) a “10 percent shareholder” of Borrower within
the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, or (iii) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C)
of the Code and (b) duly completed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN (or applicable successor form) or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or applicable successor
form), as applicable; or
 
(4)              
to the extent such a Lender Party is not the beneficial owner, duly completed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor
form), accompanied by an IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor form), an IRS Form W-8BEN (or any successor form), an IRS Form W- 8BEN-E (or
any successor form), a certificate in substantially the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, an IRS Form W-9
(or any successor form), and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that, if such
Lender Party is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Lender Party are claiming the portfolio interest exemption,
such Lender Party may provide a certificate, in substantially the form of Exhibit H-4, on behalf of each such direct and
indirect partner;
 
(C)              any
Lender Party that is a Foreign Lender Party shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower and the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender Party becomes a Lender Party under this Agreement (and from time
to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or the Administrative Agent) any other form prescribed by applicable
Requirements of Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding Tax duly completed
together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law to permit Borrower and the
Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 


62
 

 
(D)            
In the case of a Lender Party that would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA on payments
made to or on account of such Lender Party hereunder or any other Loan Document if such Lender Party were to fail to comply with the applicable
reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender Party
shall deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law and at such time
or times reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower and
the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to
determine that such Lender Party has complied with such Lender Party’s obligations under FATCA, or to determine the amount to deduct
and withhold from any such payments. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA
after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each Lender Party agrees that
if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form
or certification or promptly notify Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(f)               
Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it
has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.18 (including by the payment
of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.18), it shall pay to Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only
to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by Borrower under this Section 2.18 with respect to
the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Recipient and without interest (other than any interest
paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that Borrower, upon the request of such Recipient,
agrees to repay the amount paid over to Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.18 (plus any penalties, interest or other
charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Recipient in the event such Recipient is required to repay such refund
to such Governmental Authority. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its Tax returns (or any
other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to Borrower or any other person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
in no event will a Recipient be required to pay any amount to Borrower the payment of which would place such Recipient in a less favorable
net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had
never been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had
never been paid.
 


63
 

 
(g)              
 Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after
demand therefor, for any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that Borrower has not already indemnified
the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), any Taxes attributable
to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.04 relating to the maintenance of a Participant
Register and any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection
with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly
or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative
Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative
Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (g).
 
Section
2.19       Mitigation
Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
 
(a)              
Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13,
or requires Borrower to pay any additional amount to such Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of such Lender pursuant
to Section 2.18, then such Lender shall use commercially reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office (including
an existing office in another jurisdiction) for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder
to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation, change, or assignment
would avoid the imposition of, or in the future eliminate or reduce, amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or Section
2.18, as the case may be and would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially
disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by such Lender
in connection with any such designation or assignment. A certificate setting forth such costs and expenses and accompanying calculations
submitted by such Lender to Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(b)              
Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if Borrower is required
to pay any additional amount to such Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of such Lender pursuant to Section 2.18(a),
or if a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if Borrower exercises its replacement rights under Section 10.02(c), then Borrower
may at any time, at its sole expense and effort (except that assignment costs and expenses associated with a replacement of a Defaulting
Lender may be recovered from such Defaulting Lender), upon notice to such Lender and, in the case of a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative
Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in,
and consents required by, Section 10.04(b)), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment); provided that:
 


64
 

 
(i)                
 Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the processing and recordation fee specified in Section 10.04(b);
 
(ii)             
subject to Section 2.21, such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal
of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
(including any amounts under Section 2.16), from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest
and fees) or Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
 
(iii)           
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments
required to be made pursuant to Section 2.18, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments
thereafter; and
 
(iv)            
such assignment does not conflict with applicable Requirements of Law.
 
A Lender shall not be required
to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling
Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
 
Each Lender agrees that, if
Borrower elects to replace such Lender in accordance with this Section 2.19(b), such Lender shall promptly execute and deliver
to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption to evidence the assignment and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any
Note (if Notes have been issued in respect of such Lender’s Loans) subject to such Assignment and Assumption, and such Lender being
replaced shall no longer constitute a “Lender” hereunder and all of its Commitments shall be deemed terminated, and the Eligible
Assignee replacing such Lender shall constitute a “Lender” hereunder (including assumption of the Commitment, if any, and
other obligations of the Lender being so replaced); provided that the failure of any such Lender to execute an Assignment and Assumption
or other assignment and assumption documentation shall not render such assignment invalid and such assignment shall be recorded in the
Register.
 
Section
2.20       [Reserved].
 
Section
2.21       Defaulting
Lenders.
 
Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as
such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
 
(a)              
the Commitment Fee shall cease to accrue on the Commitment of such Lender, so long as it is a Defaulting Lender;
 
(b)              
[reserved];
 
(c)              
[reserved];
 


65
 

 
(d)              
 any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of any such
Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting
Lender pursuant to Section 10.09 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent
as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second,
to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Bank hereunder; third, to Cash
Collateralize the Issuing Banks’ Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with this Section; fourth,
as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting
Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth,
if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy
such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and cash collateralize
the Issuing Banks’ future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued
under this Agreement, in accordance with this Section; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or the Issuing
Banks as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or the Issuing Banks against such Defaulting
Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document;
seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s
breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise
directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans
or Reimbursement Obligations in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and such Loans were
made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied
or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and Reimbursement Obligations owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders
on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or Reimbursement Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender
until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in the Borrower’s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting
Lender’s L/C Exposure are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Revolving Commitments without giving effect to clause
(b) above or clause (f) below. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender
that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section shall be deemed
paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto;
 
(e)              
[reserved];
 


66
 

 
(f)               
if any L/C Exposure exists with respect to such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then:
 
(i)                 all
or any part of the L/C Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated (effective as of the date such Lender becomes a
Defaulting Lender) among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages (for the purposes of
such reallocation, such Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Commitment shall be disregarded in determining the non-Defaulting
Lenders’ respective Pro Rata Percentages), but only to the extent that the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving
Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender’s L/C Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting
Lenders’ Commitments, after giving effect to any such reallocation, no non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Credit Exposure
shall exceed such non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time and
the other conditions set forth in Section 4.02 have been satisfied at such time;
 
(ii)             
if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower
shall, within one Business Day following the Borrower’s receipt of written notice from the Administrative Agent, Cash Collateralize
for the benefit of the applicable Issuing Banks only Borrower’s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender’s L/C
Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 2.22(i) for so long as such L/C Exposure is outstanding;
 
(iii)           
if Borrower Cash Collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s L/C Exposure pursuant to clause (ii)
above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any Letter of Credit fees pursuant to Section 2.05 with respect to such
Defaulting Lender’s L/C Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s L/C Exposure is Cash Collateralized by Borrower;
 
(iv)            
if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s L/C Exposure is reallocated pursuant to clause (i)
above, then all Letter of Credit fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.05
with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s reallocated L/C Exposure shall be payable to the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with
such non-Defaulting Lenders’ Pro Rata Percentages after giving effect to such reallocation;
 
(v)              
if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s L/C Exposure is neither reallocated nor Cash Collateralized pursuant
to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any
other Lender hereunder, all Letter of Credit fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender under Section
2.05 with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s unreallocated L/C Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Banks, ratably
based on the portion of the Fronting Exposure attributable to the Letters of Credit issued by each Issuing Bank, until and to the extent
that such L/C Exposure is reallocated and/or Cash Collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above; and
 
(g)               so
long as such Lender is determined by the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank to be a Defaulting Lender, such Issuing Bank shall
not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related Fronting Exposure and the
Defaulting Lender’s then outstanding L/C Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or
Cash Collateral will be provided by Borrower in accordance with Section 2.21, and participating interests in any newly
issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.21 (and
such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
 


67
 

 
The rights and remedies against
a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.21 are in addition to other rights and remedies that Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and the non-Defaulting Lenders may have against such Defaulting Lender. The arrangements permitted or required by this Section
2.21 shall be permitted under this Agreement, notwithstanding any limitation on Liens or the pro rata sharing provisions or otherwise.
The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.21 are in addition to other rights and remedies
that Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the non- Defaulting Lenders may have against such Defaulting Lender.
 
Section
2.22       Letters
of Credit.
 
(a)              
General:
 
(i)                 Subject
to the terms and conditions hereof, including, without limitation, the conditions precedent in Section 4.02, the
limitations set forth in the definition of the term “Issuing Bank” and any applicable requirements of Section
2.21, each Issuing Bank agrees, severally and not jointly, to issue, from time to time prior to the termination of the
Availability Period, at the request of Borrower and on behalf of the Lenders and in reliance on their obligations under this Section
2.22, one or more Letters of Credit for Borrower’s account in any Accepted Currency in a face amount in each case of
at least $3,000, and in an aggregate undrawn face amount for all Letters of Credit at any time outstanding not to exceed the
applicable Letters of Credit Maximum Amount; provided, that no Issuing Bank shall issue, increase or extend a Letter of
Credit pursuant to this Section 2.22, if, immediately after the issuance, increase or extension thereof, the
outstanding aggregate Revolving Exposures would thereby exceed the Revolving Commitments, if, immediately after the issuance,
increase or extension thereof, the aggregate undrawn face amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding would at any time
thereafter (giving effect to the respective scheduled expiration dates thereof and any automatic extensions provided therein) exceed
the Letters of Credit Maximum Amount (including any individual maximum amounts for any individual Issuing Bank as described in the
definition of Letters of Credit Maximum Amount), or if the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate any legal or regulatory
restriction then applicable to such Issuing Bank or any Lender as notified by such Issuing Bank or such Lender to the Administrative
Agent before the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit. If the Administrative Agent notifies the Issuing Banks that any
conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have not been satisfied and instructs the Issuing Banks to suspend the
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of Letters of Credit, no Issuing Bank shall issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of
Credit without the consent of the Administrative Agent until such notice is withdrawn by the Administrative Agent. If the
Administrative Agent so notifies the Issuing Banks pursuant to the previous sentence, it shall also provide prompt notice of same to
the Borrower. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, a Letter of Credit issued hereunder may contain
a statement to the effect that such Letter of Credit is issued for the account of any Guarantor; provided, that
notwithstanding such statement, Borrower shall be the actual account party for all purposes of this Agreement for such Letter of
Credit and such statement shall not affect Borrower’s Reimbursement Obligations hereunder with respect to such Letter of
Credit;
 


68
 

 
(ii)             
Borrower may from time to time request that Letters of Credit be issued in a Discretionary Foreign Currency in accordance
with this Section 2.22(a)(ii) and, in the event that any provision of this Section 2.22(a)(ii) conflicts with
Section 2.22(b), the provisions of this Section 2.22(a)(ii) shall control with respect to Letters of Credit
issued in Discretionary Foreign Currencies. In the case of any such request with respect to the issuance of Letters of Credit in a Discretionary
Foreign Currency, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank. Any such
request shall be made to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, at least three
(3) Business Days prior to the date of the desired Letter of Credit issuance (or such other time or date as may be agreed to by the Administrative
Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank in their sole discretion). In the case of any such request, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
advise each applicable Issuing Bank thereof. Each Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent, not later than Noon, New York time,
two (2) Business Days (or such other period of time as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) after receipt
of such request, whether it consents, in its sole discretion, to the issuance of Letters of Credit in such requested Discretionary Foreign
Currency. Any failure by any Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to respond to such request within the time period specified in the preceding
sentence shall be deemed to be a refusal by such Issuing Bank to permit Letters of Credit to be issued in such requested Discretionary
Foreign Currency. If the Administrative Agent and an Issuing Bank consent to the issuance of Letters of Credit in such requested Discretionary
Foreign Currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any refusal or deemed refusal by an
Issuing Bank to issue a Letter of Credit in a Discretionary Foreign Currency pursuant to any such request shall be specific to each such
request and not a prospective refusal to agree to any such request at a later date.
 
(b)              
Issuance Procedure:
 
(i)                 To
request that a Issuing Bank issue a Letter of Credit, Borrower shall deliver to such Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (with
a duplicate copy to an operations employee of such Issuing Bank as designated by such Issuing Bank from time to time) a duly
executed Issuance Request, together with a duly executed Application (unless previously executed and delivered by Borrower) for the
relevant Letter of Credit, or such other computerized issuance or application procedure, instituted from time to time by such
Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent and agreed to by Borrower, completed to the reasonable satisfaction of such Issuing Bank
and the Administrative Agent, and such other information as such Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.
In the event of any irreconcilable difference or inconsistency between this Agreement and any Application, the provisions of this
Agreement shall govern. Upon receipt of a properly completed and executed Issuance Request and Application (as required) and any
other reasonably requested information at least three (3) Business Days prior to any requested issuance date, such Issuing Bank will
process such Issuance Request in accordance with its customary procedures and, subject to Borrower’s compliance with any
applicable requirements of Section 2.21, issue the requested Letter of Credit on the requested issuance date. Borrower
may cancel any requested issuance of a Letter of Credit prior to the issuance thereof. The applicable Issuing Bank will notify the
Administrative Agent and each Lender of the amount, currency, and expiration date of each Letter of Credit it issues promptly upon
issuance thereof. Subject to clause (b)(ii) below, each Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date no later than
five (5) Business Days before the Maturity Date. If any Issuing Bank issues any Letters of Credit with expiration dates that
automatically extend unless such Issuing Bank gives notice that the expiration date will not so extend, such Issuing Bank will give
such notice of non-renewal before the time necessary to prevent such automatic extension if (and will not give such notice of
non-renewal before such time unless) before such required notice date (A) the expiration date of such Letter of Credit if so
extended would be later than five (5) Business Days before the Maturity Date, (B) the Maturity Date shall have occurred, (C) a
Default or an Event of Default exists and the Required Lenders have given such Issuing Bank instructions not to so permit the
expiration date of such Letter of Credit to be extended, or (D) such Issuing Bank is so directed by Borrower. Each Issuing Bank
agrees to issue amendments to any Letter of Credit issued by it increasing its amount, or extending its expiration date, at the
request of Borrower, subject to the conditions precedent of Section 4.02 and the other terms and conditions of this Section
2.22, including without limitation, any applicable requirements of Section 2.21.

(ii)             
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with the consent of the applicable Issuing Bank, any Letter of Credit issued
by such Issuing Bank may have an expiration date later than five (5) Business Days before the Maturity Date to any such later date as
may be agreed by the applicable Issuing Bank, if Borrower shall provide or cause to be provided, no later than the Maturity Date Cash
Collateral or a back-to-back letter of credit from a bank or financial institution whose short-term unsecured debt rating is rated A-3
(or equivalent) or above from either S&P or Moody’s (or such other bank or financial institution satisfactory to the applicable
Issuing Bank) and which provides that such Issuing Bank may make a drawing thereunder in the event that such Issuing Bank pays a drawing
under such Letter of Credit, in each case, in an amount equal to not less than 105% of the undrawn face amount of such Letter of Credit
or other arrangements satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank in its sole discretion shall have been made with respect to such Letter
of Credit; provided, each Lender’s participation under Section 2.22(d) in any such Letter of Credit shall revert to
such Issuing Bank on the Maturity Date, and no Lender shall be entitled to any Letter of Credit fees pursuant to Section 2.05
on and after the Maturity Date.
 
(iii)           
Each Issuing Bank that issues a Letter of Credit agrees to issue amendments to any Letter of Credit increasing its amount,
or extending its expiration date, at the request of Borrower, subject to the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02
(which each Issuing Bank may assume are satisfied unless notified otherwise by the Administrative Agent) and the other terms and conditions
of this Section 2.22.
 


70
 

 
(c)               Borrower’s
Reimbursement Obligations. Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to reimburse each Issuing Bank in the
applicable Accepted Currency in which the applicable Letter of Credit is denominated (or, if relating to a Letter of Credit
denominated in a Discretionary Foreign Currency, in the Dollar Equivalent thereof) for each payment or disbursement made by such
Issuing Bank to settle its obligations under any draft drawn or other payment made under a Letter of Credit (a
 “Reimbursement Obligation”) within two (2) Business Days from when Borrower has been notified in writing
by the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank that such draft is paid or other payment is made with either funds not borrowed
hereunder or with a Borrowing made pursuant to Section 2.03 and the other terms and conditions contained in this
Agreement. Borrower’s Reimbursement Obligation shall apply to all Letters of Credit issued hereunder, regardless of whether
the obligations supported by such Letters of Credit are those of Borrower, any Guarantor, or any other Person. The Reimbursement
Obligation shall bear interest (which Borrower hereby promises to pay) from and after the date such draft is paid or other payment
is made until (but excluding the date) the Reimbursement Obligation is paid at the lesser of the Highest Lawful Rate, or the
Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for ABR Loans then in effect, in each case so long as the Reimbursement
Obligation shall not be past due, and thereafter at the Default Rate per annum as set forth in Section 2.06, whether
or not the Maturity Date shall have occurred. If any such payment or disbursement is reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on the date
such payment or disbursement is made by such Issuing Bank, interest shall be paid to such Issuing Bank on the reimbursed amount for
one (1) day. Each Issuing Bank shall give Borrower notice of any drawing on a Letter of Credit issued by it within one (1) Business
Day after such drawing is paid.
 
(i)                
Borrower agrees for the benefit of each Issuing Bank and each Lender that, notwithstanding any provision of any Application,
the obligations of Borrower under this Section 2.22(c) and each required Application shall be absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and each required Application under all circumstances
whatsoever (other than the defense of payment in accordance with this Agreement), including, without limitation, the following circumstances
(subject in all cases to the defense of payment in accordance with this Agreement):
 
(A)            
any lack of validity or enforceability of any of the L/C Documents;
 
(B)           
any amendment or waiver of or any consent to depart from all or any of the provisions of any of the L/C Documents;
 
(C)             
the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary of a Letter
of Credit (or any person for whom a beneficiary may be acting), any Issuing Bank, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection
with this Agreement, another L/C Document or any unrelated transaction;
 
(D)            
any statement or any other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient
in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;
 


71
 

 
(E)             
 payment by any Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation to such Issuing Bank of a draft or certificate
that does not comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit; or
 
(F)             
any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any Issuing Bank, any Lender or any other Person or any other event
or circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.22(c), constitute a legal or equitable discharge
of Borrower’s obligations hereunder, under an Issuance Request or under an Application; provided, however, the foregoing
shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (but excluding consequential
damages, which are hereby waived to the extent not prohibited by applicable law) suffered by Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank’s
gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 
(d)               The
Participating Interests. Each Lender severally and not jointly agrees to purchase from each Issuing Bank, and each Issuing Bank
hereby agrees to sell to each Lender, an undivided percentage participating interest, to the extent of its Pro Rata Percentage, in
each Letter of Credit issued by, and Reimbursement Obligation owed to, such Issuing Bank in connection with a Letter of Credit. Upon
any failure by Borrower to pay any Reimbursement Obligation in connection with a Letter of Credit at the time required in Section
2.22(c), or if any Issuing Bank is required at any time to return to Borrower or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator,
custodian or other Person any portion of any payment by Borrower of any Reimbursement Obligation in connection with a Letter of
Credit, such Issuing Bank shall promptly give notice of same to each Lender, and such Issuing Bank shall have the right to require
each Lender to fund its participation in such Reimbursement Obligation. Each Lender (except the Issuing Bank for the applicable
Letter of Credit to the extent it is also a Lender) shall pay to the applicable Issuing Bank an amount in US Dollars (or, if
relating to a Letter of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency, in the Dollar Equivalent thereof) equal to such Lender’s Pro
Rata Percentage of such unpaid or returned Reimbursement Obligation not later than the Business Day it receives notice from such
Issuing Bank to such effect, if such notice is received before 2:00 P.M., or not later than the following Business Day if such
notice is received after such time. If a Lender fails to pay timely such amount to any Issuing Bank, it shall also pay to such
Issuing Bank interest on such amount accrued from the date payment of such amount was made by such Issuing Bank to the date of such
payment by the Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Administrative Agent’s cost of funds, such rate to be applicable until
the second Business Day after such payment by such Issuing Bank and thereafter at the Alternate Base Rate in effect for each such
day, and only after such payment shall such Lender be entitled to receive its Pro Rata Percentage of each payment received on the
relevant Reimbursement Obligation and of interest paid thereon. The several obligations of the Lenders to each Issuing Bank under
this Section 2.22(d) shall be absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
shall not be subject to any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment any Lender may have or have had against Borrower, such
Issuing Bank, and any other Lender or any other Person whatsoever including, but not limited to, any defense based on the failure of
the demand for payment under the Letter of Credit to conform to the terms of such Letter of Credit or the legality, validity,
regularity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit and including, but not limited to, those resulting from such issuing
bank’s own simple or contributory negligence. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such obligations shall not be
affected by any Default or Event of Default or by any subsequent reduction or termination of any Commitment of a Lender, and each
payment by a Lender under this Section 2.22(d) shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction
whatsoever.
 


72
 

 
(e)              
Letter of Credit Amounts and Foreign Currency. (1) Unless otherwise
specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect
at such time; provided, however, that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any Application
related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall
be deemed to be the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum
stated amount is in effect at such time. For purposes of calculations of amounts payable under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
including Reimbursement Obligations and fees and for comparisons, measurements or other determinations of such amounts hereunder and thereunder,
in any case, with respect to Letters of Credit denominated in any Discretionary Foreign Currency in accordance with Section 2.22(a)(ii),
such amounts shall be converted to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the Revaluation Date in accordance with the immediately following
sentence. Without in any way limiting the foregoing provisions, all calculations of Dollar Equivalents shall be made in accordance with
the definition of “Dollar Equivalent” and such calculations shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(i)                
Borrower shall, and shall cause the other Loan Parties to, make payment relative to any Obligation with respect to Letters
of Credit in the applicable Accepted Currency in which the applicable Letter of Credit is denominated (or, if relating to a Letter of
Credit denominated in a Discretionary Foreign Currency, in the Dollar Equivalent thereof) (the “Agreed Currency”).
If any payment is received on account of any such Obligation in any currency other than the Agreed Currency (the “Other Currency”)
(whether voluntarily or pursuant to an order or judgment or the enforcement thereof or the realization of any collateral, if any, or the
liquidation of a Loan Party or otherwise), such payment shall constitute a discharge of the liability of the Loan Parties hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents in respect of such obligation only to the extent of the amount of the Agreed Currency which the relevant
Issuing Bank is able to purchase with the amount of the Other Currency received by it on the Business Day next following such receipt
in accordance with its normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction and applicable law after deducting any costs of exchange.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if the amount of the Other Currency received is insufficient to satisfy the obligation
in the Agreed Currency in full, then the Borrower does hereby agree to indemnify the Issuing Banks from and against any loss or cost arising
out of or in connection with such deficiency; provided that if the amount of the Agreed Currency so purchased is greater than the
amount of the Agreed Currency due in respect of such liability immediately prior to such judgment or order, voluntary prepayment, realization
of collateral, if any, liquidation of a Loan Party or otherwise, then the Administrative Agent, the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders,
as the case may be, agree to return the amount of any excess to Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable
law). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the foregoing indemnity and agreement by Borrower shall constitute an obligation
separate and independent from all other obligations contained in this Agreement and shall give rise to a separate and independent cause
of action.
 


73
 

 
(f)               
 Designation of Additional Issuing Banks. From time to time, Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent,
designate as additional Issuing Banks one or more Lenders, or such Lenders’ Affiliates, that agree to serve in such capacity as
provided below and are acceptable to the Administrative Agent. The acceptance by a Lender or such Lender’s Affiliate of any appointment
as a Issuing Bank hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement (an “Issuing Bank Agreement”), which shall be
in a form satisfactory to Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and shall be executed by such Lender or such Lender’s Affiliate,
Borrower, and the Administrative Agent. From and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Lender or such Lender’s Affiliate
shall have all the rights and obligations of a Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein
and in the other Loan Documents to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to include such Lender or such Lender’s Affiliate
in its capacity as a Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank Agreement of any Issuing Bank may limit the total stated amounts and the currencies
in which such Issuing Bank will issue Letters of Credit, and any such limitations will, as to such Issuing Bank, be deemed to be incorporated
in this Agreement.
 
(g)              
Replacement of an Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among Borrower,
the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank, and the successor Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective,
Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.05. From and
after the effective date of any such replacement, the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of a Issuing Bank
under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and references herein to the term “Issuing
Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, as the context shall require. After the replacement
of a Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations
of a Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required
to issue additional Letters of Credit.
 
(h)              
Issuing Bank Reports. Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall report in writing
to the Administrative Agent (i) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank issues, amends, renews or extends any Letter
of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, the currencies and stated amounts of the Letters of Credit issued,
amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (and whether
the amounts thereof shall have changed), it being understood that such Issuing Bank shall not effect any issuance, renewal, extension
or amendment resulting in an increase in the aggregate amount of the Letters of Credit issued by it without first obtaining written confirmation
from the Administrative Agent that such increase is then permitted under this Agreement, (ii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing
Bank makes any payment under any Letter of Credit, the date, currency and amount of such payment, (iii) on any Business Day on which Borrower
fails to reimburse any payment under any Letter of Credit required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such
failure, the currency and amount of such payment, and (iv) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent
shall reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank.
 


74
 

 

 
(i)                
 Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower
receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders
with L/C Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total L/C Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph,
the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of
the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the aggregate L/C Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become
immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the
Borrower described in Section 8.01(d). Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment
and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control,
including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which
investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower’s risk and expense,
such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such
account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for Reimbursement Obligations for which
it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the
Borrower for the L/C Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders
with L/C Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total L/C Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations. If the Borrower is
required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of Event of Default, such amount (to the extent
not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or
waived.
 
(j)                 Existing
Letters of Credit Any Letters of Credit outstanding as of the Closing Date under the Existing Credit Agreement shall be
deemed to be Letters of Credit issued pursuant to this Agreement.
 
Section
2.23       Incremental
Facilities.
 
(a)               The
Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent enter into one or more increases to the existing Revolving Credit
Commitments and/or to the Letters of Credit Maximum Amount (each such increase, an “Incremental Commitment”, and
each such facility, an “Incremental Facility”) in an aggregate amount not in excess of $100,000,000 and in
addition as otherwise permitted under this Agreement pursuant to the requirements of Section 6.06(p). Each such notice shall
specify (i) the date (each, an “Incremental Effective Date”) on which the Borrower proposes that the Incremental
Commitments shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than 10 Business Days after the date on which such notice is
delivered to the Administrative Agent and (ii) the identity of each Eligible Assignee that is a commercial bank to whom the Borrower
proposes any portion of such Incremental Commitments be allocated and the amounts of such allocations; provided that any existing
Lender may be approached to provide all or a portion of the Incremental Commitments and may elect or decline, in its sole
discretion, to provide such Incremental Commitment. Each Incremental Commitment shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any
whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Each Incremental Commitment that increases the Letters of Credit Maximum Amount shall
also increase the amount of Revolving Credit Commitments by an amount corresponding to such increase in the Letters of Credit
Maximum Amount and such increased amount shall be provided by the relevant Lender making such Incremental Commitment. The
Incremental Commitments shall be effected by a joinder agreement (the “Incremental Joinder”) executed by the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender making such Incremental Commitment, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to each of them. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.02, the Incremental Joinder may, without the
consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or
appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.23. In addition,
unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all references in Loan Documents to Revolving Credit Loans or Letters of Credit shall
be deemed, unless the context otherwise requires, to include references to Revolving Credit Loans or Letters of Credit made pursuant
to Incremental Commitments, respectively, made pursuant to this Agreement. This Section 2.23 shall supersede any provisions in
Section 2.17 or Section 10.02 to the contrary.
 


75
 

 
(b)              
The Incremental Commitments shall become effective as of the Incremental Effective Date; provided that:
 
(A)            
each of the conditions set forth in the relevant Incremental Joinder shall be satisfied;
 
(B)             
each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 shall be satisfied;
 
(C)             
on a pro forma basis (assuming that such Incremental Commitments are fully drawn or utilized), the Borrower shall be in
compliance with each of the covenants set forth in Section 5.02 as of the end of the latest fiscal quarter;
 
(D)            
the Borrower shall make any breakage payments in connection with any adjustment of Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to Section
2.15(d);
 
(E)             
the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered officer’s certificates and legal opinions of the type delivered
on the Closing Date to the extent reasonably requested by, and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to, the Administrative Agent;
and
 
(c)              
Terms of New Loans and Commitments. The terms and provisions of Revolving Credit Loans and Letters of Credit made
available pursuant to the Incremental Commitments shall be identical to the existing Revolving Credit Loans and Letters of Credit.
 
(d)               Adjustment
of Revolving Credit Loans Outstanding. Each Lender that is making an Incremental Commitment on the Incremental Effective Date
shall make a Revolving Credit Loan, the proceeds of which will be used to prepay any Revolving Credit Loans outstanding of the other
Revolving Credit Lenders immediately prior to such Incremental Effective Date, so that, after giving effect thereto, the Revolving
Credit Loans outstanding are held by the Revolving Credit Lenders pro rata based on their Revolving Credit Commitments after giving
effect to such Incremental Effective Date. If there is a new borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans on such Incremental Effective Date,
the Revolving Credit Lenders after giving effect to such Incremental Effective Date shall make such Revolving Credit Loans.
 


76
 

 
(e)              
Equal and Ratable Benefit. The Loans and Commitments established pursuant to this Section 2.23 shall
constitute Loans and Commitments under, and the Lenders of such Loans and Commitments shall constitute Lenders under, and shall be entitled
to all the benefits afforded by, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, benefit equally
and ratably from the Guarantees and security interests created by the Collateral Documents, except that the new Loans may be subordinated
in right of payment or the Liens securing the new Loans may be subordinated, in each case, to the extent set forth in the Incremental
Joinder. The Loan Parties shall take any actions reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to ensure and/or demonstrate that the
Lien and security interests granted by the Collateral Documents continue to be perfected after giving effect to the establishment of such
new Loans and Commitments.

Section
5.10       Further
Assurances; Collateral Coverage.
 
(a)              
Subject to the applicable limitations set forth in the Security Documents, the Loan Parties will execute any and all further
documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all such further actions that the Collateral Agent or the Required
Lenders may reasonably request, in order to grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and priority of the security interests created
or intended to be created by the applicable Security Documents, all at the expense of the Loan Parties.
 
(b)              
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Security Agreement, or any other Loan Document, (i) the
Administrative Agent may grant extensions of time for the requirements of the creation or perfection of security interests in or the obtaining
of title opinions or other title information, legal opinions, flood insurance and surveys with respect to particular assets (including
extensions beyond the Closing Date for the perfection of security interests in the assets of the Loan Parties on such date) where it reasonably
determines, in consultation with the Borrower, that perfection or obtaining of such items is not required by law or cannot be accomplished
without undue effort or expense by the time or times at which it would otherwise be required by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents,
(ii) Liens required to be granted from time to time pursuant to this Agreement and the Security Documents shall be subject to exceptions
and limitations set forth in the Security Documents and, to the extent appropriate in any applicable jurisdiction, as otherwise agreed
between the Collateral Agent and the Borrower and (iii) the Collateral Agent and the Borrower may make such modifications to the Security
Documents as are reasonable or necessary to effectuate the intent thereof or are otherwise permitted by this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.
 
(c)              
Collateral Coverage.
 
(i)                 Within
45 days (or such longer period of time permitted by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) (the “Collateral
Coverage Cure Period”) after the deadline for delivering an Officer’s Certificate pursuant to Section
5.01(c) with respect to any fiscal quarter that, if such Officer’s Certificate is delivered by such deadline, shows
or, if not delivered by such deadline for such fiscal quarter, could reasonably be expected to show, that the Collateral Rig Value
is less than the Collateral Coverage Threshold, Holdings shall either (A) cause Marketed Rigs that are not currently Collateral Rigs
to become Collateral Rigs or Related Yard Equipment that is not currently Collateral to become Collateral and to satisfy the
Collateral Rig Requirements with respect thereto to the extent necessary to cause the Collateral Rig Value to be at least equal to
the Collateral Coverage Threshold and deliver (1) an updated Officer’s Certificate setting forth a calculation of the
Collateral Rig Value (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an updated Appraisal Report with respect to any such additional
Collateral Rigs or Related Yard Equipment) giving pro forma effect to such additional Collateral Rigs or Related Yard Equipment and
(2) such other security documents and/or amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent, which shall
include such representations and warranties to be made by the applicable Loan Parties party thereto with respect to Sections

prepayment shall not be required to be accompanied by a corresponding permanent reduction of the Revolving Commitments) in an amount
necessary.to cause the Collateral Rig Value to be at least equal to the Collateral Coverage Threshold.  For the avoidance of
doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Collateral Rig Value being less than the Collateral Coverage
Threshold at the end of any fiscal quarter shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default so long as Holdings and/or its
Subsidiaries shall have taken the actions specified in the preceding sentence prior to the expiration of the Collateral Coverage
Cure Period.

Equipment as Collateral and complete the Collateral Rig Requirements with respect thereto so that the Collateral Rig Value will not be
less than the Collateral Coverage Threshold or (B) prepay the Loans (which prepayment shall not be required to be accompanied by a corresponding
permanent reduction of the Revolving Commitments) in an amount necessary to cause the Collateral Rig Value to be at least equal to the
Collateral Coverage Threshold, in each case on a pro forma basis immediately after giving effect to such sale, consensual disposition
or Event of Loss.
 
(iii)           
In addition, upon 45 days’ (or such shorter period of time permitted by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion)

that is no later than six months following the latest date that the last delivered Appraisal Report was required to be delivered (with
such determinations to be conducted on the basis of one field examination and one “desktop” appraisal during each 12-month
period following the Closing Date).
 
(vii)

Liens) on, or claims enforceable against, such Collateral Rig other than any of the foregoing being contested in good faith and diligently
by appropriate proceedings, and, in the event of arrest of any Collateral Rig pursuant to legal process, or in the event of its detention
in exercise or purported exercise of any such Lien or claim as aforesaid, procure, if reasonably possible, the release of such Collateral
Rig from such arrest or detention forthwith upon receiving notice thereof by providing bail or otherwise as the circumstances may require.
 
(c)              
To the extent applicable, Holdings and its Subsidiaries will cause each Collateral Rig Owner or Collateral Rig Operator

called the “Guaranteed Obligations”). Each Guarantor hereby agrees that if Borrower shall fail to pay in
full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantor will promptly
pay the same in cash, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal

cash, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed
Hedge Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance

Party for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(ii) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
 
Section

Unconditional.
 
The obligations of each Guarantor
under Section 7.01 shall constitute a guaranty of payment (and not of collection) and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Requirements of Law, are absolute, irrevocable and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity
or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes, if any, Guaranteed Hedge Agreements,
if any, Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements, if any, or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any substitution,
release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, irrespective of any other circumstance
whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or a guarantor (except for payment in
full). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not
alter, impair, release, limit or otherwise affect the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which shall remain absolute, irrevocable and
unconditional under any and all circumstances as described above:
 


105
 

 
(a)      at
any time or from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Guaranteed
Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived;
 
(b)      any
of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or any other agreement or instrument referred
to herein or therein shall be done or omitted;
 
(c)      the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be amended
in any respect, or any right under the Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be amended
or waived in any respect or any other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or exchanged
in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;
 
(d)      any impossibility, impracticability, frustration of purpose, illegality, force majeure or act of government;
 
(e)      the
bankruptcy, winding-up, liquidation, dissolution, moratorium, readjustment of debt or insolvency of any Loan Party or any other person,
including any discharge or bar against collection of any of the Obligations, or the amalgamation of or any change in the existence, structure,
name, status, function, control, constitution or ownership of any Loan Party, Lender or any other person;
 
(f)       any lack or limitation of power, incapacity or disability on the part of any Loan Party or of the directors, partners or
agents thereof or any other irregularity, defect or informality on the part of any Loan Party in its obligations to the applicable Lenders;
 
(g)      any law regulation or any other event affecting any term of a Guaranteed Obligation;
 
(h)      any
limitation, postponement, prohibition, subordination or other restriction on the right of any Lender to payment of the Obligations; or
 
(i)       any interest of any Lender, Guaranteed Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank in any property whether as owner thereof or as
holder of a security interest therein or thereon, being invalidated, voided, declared fraudulent or preferential or otherwise set aside,
or by reason of any impairment of any right or recourse to collateral.
 
The foregoing provisions apply
and the foregoing waivers, to the extent permitted under applicable law, shall be effective even if the effect of any action or failure
to take action by the Beneficiaries is to destroy or diminish any Guarantor’s subrogation rights, any Guarantor’s right to
proceed against a Borrower for reimbursement, any Guarantor’s right to recover contribution from any other guarantor or any other
right or remedy of any such Guarantor.
 


106
 

 
Each Guarantor hereby
expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that any
Beneficiary exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Borrower under this Agreement or the Notes, if any, the
Guaranteed Hedge Agreements, if any, the Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements, if any, or any other agreement or instrument
referred to herein or therein, or against any other person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed
Obligations. Each Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension, waiver, termination or accrual of any of
the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by any Beneficiary upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this
Guarantee, and the Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or
incurred in reliance upon this Guarantee, and all dealings between any Borrower and the Beneficiaries shall likewise be conclusively
presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee. This Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing,
absolute, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to any right of offset with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations at any time or from time to time held by Beneficiaries, and the obligations and liabilities of each Guarantor hereunder
shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by the Beneficiaries or any other person at any time of any right or remedy
against any Borrower or against any other person which may be or become liable in respect of all or any part of the Guaranteed
Obligations or against any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto. This Guarantee shall
remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon each Guarantor and the
successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of (x) with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, the Lender
Parties, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and (y) with respect to the Guaranteed Hedge Obligations, the Hedge

of this Agreement there may be no Guaranteed Obligations, or Guaranteed Hedge Obligations, respectively, outstanding.
 
Section
7.03       Reinstatement.
 
The obligations of each Guarantor
under this Section 7.03 shall be automatically reinstated with respect to the Obligations, if and to the extent that for
any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Loan Party in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations or Guaranteed Hedge Obligations is rescinded
or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of such Guaranteed Obligations or Guaranteed Hedge Obligations, as applicable.

Guaranteed Obligations.

security for any of the Guaranteed Hedge Obligations.
 


107
 

 
Section
7.05       Remedies.
 
Each Guarantor agrees that,
as between such Guarantor and the Lenders, the obligations of each Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes, if any, may be declared
to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 8.03 (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable
in the circumstances provided in Section 8.03) for purposes of Section 7.01, notwithstanding any stay, injunction
or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against such Borrower
and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such obligations
(whether or not due and payable by such Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by each Guarantor for purposes of Section
7.01.
 
Section
7.06       Instrument
for the Payment of Money.
 
Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges
that the guarantee in of such Guarantor in Section 7.01 constitutes an instrument for the payment of money, and consents
and agrees that any Lender or any Administrative Agent, at its sole option, in the event of a dispute by any Guarantor in the payment
of any moneys due hereunder, shall have the right to bring a motion- action under New York CPLR Section 3213.
 
Section
7.07       Continuing
Guarantee.
 
Each guarantee in Section
7.01 is a continuing guarantee of payment, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising.
 
Section
7.08       General
Limitation on Guarantee Obligations.
 
In any action or proceeding
involving any state corporate limited partnership or limited liability company law, or any applicable state, federal or foreign bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor or the Borrower
under Section 7.01 would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated
to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section 7.01, then, notwithstanding
any other provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by any Loan Party or any other person,
be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors
as determined in such action or proceeding.

Section
8.03       Acceleration;
Remedies.
 
(a)      Upon
the occurrence and during the continuation of Event of Default (other than an event described in Section 8.01(d))
then, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to Borrower, take either or both of
the following actions, without prejudice to the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to enforce its claims against any
Loan Party, at the same or different times: terminate forthwith the Commitments and declare the Loans then outstanding to be
forthwith due and payable in whole or in part, whereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with
accrued interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other Obligations of Borrower accrued hereunder and under any other
Loan Document, shall become forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by each Loan Party, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary
notwithstanding; and in any event, with respect to an event described in Section 8.01(d), the Commitments shall
automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and any unpaid
accrued Fees and all other Obligations of Borrower accrued hereunder and under any other Loan Document, shall automatically become
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
each Loan Party, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding. Notwithstanding the fact
that enforcement powers reside primarily with the Administrative Agent and each Lender has, to the extent permitted by any
Requirement of Law, a separate right of payment and shall be considered a separate “creditor” holding a separate
 “claim” within the meaning of Section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other Debtor Relief Law. In addition to the

Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, but subject to Section 2.21(d), after the occurrence of an Event of Default and the exercise
of remedies by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, the Lenders, pursuant to Section 8.03 (or after the applicable
Commitments shall automatically terminate and the applicable Loans (with accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts under the Loan
Documents shall automatically become due and payable in accordance with the terms of such Section), all amounts collected or received:
 
(a)      by
the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on account of amounts outstanding under any of the Loan Documents, in each case,
that constitute Obligations, shall be paid over or delivered to the Administrative Agent to be distributed as follows:
 
(i)      First, to the payment of all reasonable costs and expenses or fees, including compensation to the Administrative
Agent and its agents and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection
with the enforcement of rights hereunder and all amounts for which the Administrative Agent is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
the provisions of any Loan Document, together with interest on each such amount at the highest rate then in effect under this Agreement
from and after the date such amount is due, owing or unpaid until paid in full;
 
(ii)     Second, to the payment of all other reasonable costs and expenses, including compensation to the other Beneficiaries
and their agents and counsel and all costs, liabilities and advances made or incurred by such other Beneficiaries, pro rata, in
connection with the enforcement of rights hereunder, together with interest on each such amount at the highest rate then in effect under
this Agreement from and after the date such amount is due, owing or unpaid until paid in full;
 


112
 

 
(iii)    Third, without duplication of amounts applied pursuant to the immediately preceding clauses (i) and
(ii) above, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash, pro rata, of accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans or
the Reimbursement Obligations to the date of the application of such amounts, until all such accrued and unpaid interest has been paid
in full;
 
(iv)    Fourth,
to the indefeasible payment in full in cash, pro rata, of principal amount of each of the Loans and any premium thereon, the amount
of the outstanding Reimbursement Obligations (reserving Cash Collateral for all undrawn face amounts of any outstanding Letters of Credit
(if Section 2.22(i) has not previously been complied with) and to pay obligations owing under Guaranteed Hedge Agreements
and Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements. In the event that any Letters of Credit, or any portions thereof, expire without being drawn,
any Cash Collateral therefor shall not be distributed by the Administrative Agent until the principal amount of all Loans and Reimbursement
Obligations have been paid in full;
 
(v)     Fifth, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash, pro rata, of any other outstanding Obligations then due
and payable, until all such Obligations have been paid in full; and
 
(vi)    Sixth,

a court of competent jurisdiction may direct;
 
provided, that Obligations arising under
Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements and Guaranteed Hedge Agreements shall be excluded from the application described above if the Administrative
Agent has not received written notice thereof, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from
the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be and amounts received from the Borrower or any Guarantor that is
not an “eligible contract participant” under the Commodity Exchange Act shall not be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligations
(it being understood, that in the event that any amount is applied to Obligations other than Excluded Swap Obligations as a result of
this clause, the Administrative Agent shall make such adjustments as it determines are appropriate to distributions pursuant to clause
fourth above from amounts received from “eligible contract participants” under the Commodity Exchange Act to ensure,
as nearly as possible, that the proportional aggregate recoveries with respect to Obligations described in clause fourth above
by the holders of any Excluded Swap Obligations are the same as the proportional aggregate recoveries with respect to other Obligations
pursuant to clause fourth above).; provided, further, that in the event that any such proceeds are insufficient to
pay in full the items described in the immediately preceding clauses (i) through (v), the Loan Parties shall
remain liable, jointly and severally, for any deficiency.
 
(b)      [Reserved]
 


113
 

 
Section
8.05       Right
to Cure.
 
(a)       Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Borrower fails to comply with the requirements
of the covenant set forth in Section 5.02(a), commencing on the first day following the end of the applicable fiscal quarter
with respect to which such covenant is being tested until the expiration of the thirtieth (30th) day after the end of any such fiscal
quarter (the “Cure Period”) any equity holder of the Borrower shall have the right to, make a direct or indirect common
equity investment (or other equity investments reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) in the Borrower) (the “Cure
Right”), and upon the receipt by the Borrower of net cash proceeds, as the case may be, pursuant to the exercise of the Cure
Right (including through the capital contribution of any such net cash proceeds to such person, the “Specified Equity Contribution”),
the covenant set forth in such Section shall be recalculated, giving effect to a pro forma increase to EBITDA to the extent such net
cash proceeds would be included in the calculation thereof; provided that such pro forma adjustment to EBITDA shall be given solely
for the purpose of determining the existence of a Default or an Event of Default under the covenant set forth in Section 5.02(a)
and only with respect to the period that includes the fiscal quarter for which such Cure Right was exercised and not for any
other purpose under any Loan Document; provided, further, that, if a Cure Right to remedy such Event of Default is available
at such time under Section 8.05(b), then until the expiration of such Cure Period, the Administrative Agent shall not have
the right to exercise any remedies against the Loan Parties as a result of the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default under
Section 8.01(c) arising from the failure to comply with Section 5.02(a), as the case may be.
 
(b)      If,
after the exercise of the Cure Right and the recalculations pursuant to clause (a) above, the Borrower shall then be in
compliance with the requirements of the covenant set forth in Section 5.02 during such period (including for purposes of
Section 4.02), the Borrower shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the covenant as of the relevant date
of determination with the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply therewith at such date, and the applicable Default
or Event of Default under Section 8.01 or 8.02 that had occurred shall be deemed cured. The exercise of the
Cure Right shall be subject to the following limitations and requirements: (i) there shall be no more than two (2) Specified Equity Contributions
during the term of this Agreement, (ii) with respect to any exercise of the Cure Right in respect of the covenant set forth in Section
5.02(a), the Specified Equity Contribution shall be no greater than the amount required to cause the Borrower to be in compliance
with the covenant set forth in Sections 5.02(a) (the “Cure Amount”) and (iii) all Specified Equity Contributions
and the use of proceeds therefrom will be disregarded for all purposes under this Loan Documents (other than for determining compliance
with Section 5.02(a)) including for the purposes of calculating pricing and determining the availability of any carve-outs
with respect to the covenants contained in Article VI or hereof.
 
(c)      In
furtherance of Sections 8.05(a) and (b) above, upon actual receipt and designation of the Cure Amount by
the Borrower, the covenant under Section 5.02(a) shall be deemed retroactively cured with the same effect as though
there had been no failure to comply with the covenant under such Section 5.02(a) and any resulting Event of Default or
potential Event of Default under Section 8.01 or Section 8.02, as applicable, shall be deemed not to
have occurred for purposes of the Loan Documents; provided, however, that prior to the making of the Specified Equity
Contribution and cure of such default in such financial covenant, such default shall constitute an Event of Default for purposes of
determining compliance with any conditions precedent to funding of Loans hereunder and in determining compliance with any provision
of the Loan Documents that restricts or prohibits certain actions during the existence of an Event of Default.

Article
IX
 
THE AGENTS
 
Section
9.01       Appointment
and Authority.
 
(a)         Each
of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Citibank, N.A. to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other

Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the
terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are
solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent (including in its capacity as Collateral Agent) and the Lenders, and neither Borrower
nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions (except as explicitly set forth herein).
For the avoidance of doubt, references in this Article IX to the Administrative Agent shall include the Administrative
Agent in its capacity as the Collateral Agent to the extent applicable.
 
(b)         [Reserved]
 
(c)         Each
Lender and each Issuing Bank acknowledges and agrees to the provisions of the appointment of the Administrative Agent pursuant to this

(d)         Each
Cash Management Bank and Hedge Bank that is not a party to this Agreement that has given notice to the Administrative Agent as contemplated
by the first proviso of Section 8.04(a) shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the appointment
of the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 9.01 and subject to the terms of Article IX for itself
and its Affiliates as if a “Lender” party hereto.
 
(e)         Without
further written consent or authorization from any Lender, the Administrative Agent is authorized to (x) enter into the Security Documents

faith determination of the Administrative Agent and Holdings, are required to effectuate the foregoing). Subject to Section 10.02,
without further written consent or authorization from any Lender, the Collateral Agent, may, upon written request of the Borrower (a)
execute any documents or instruments necessary in connection with a disposition of Collateral not prohibited by this Agreement (other
than a disposition to a Subsidiary) and (b) release any Lien encumbering any item of Collateral that is (i) the subject of such disposition
of assets or otherwise becomes Excluded Collateral, (ii) to the extent the property constituting Collateral is owned by any Guarantor,
upon the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under Section 7.09; provided that such release shall only
be permitted to the extent that the Collateral Rig Value is not less than the Collateral Coverage Threshold on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to such release, or (iii) with respect to which Required Lenders (or, in the case of the release of all or substantially
all of the Collateral, each Lender) have otherwise consented; provided that, in each case of this clause (b), the
Collateral Agent shall have received a certificate from a responsible officer of Holdings demonstrating that the Collateral Rig Value
is not less than the Collateral Coverage Threshold on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such release.
 

115
 

 

(f)         Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in any of the Loan Documents, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby agree that (a)
no Lender shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral, it being understood and agreed that all powers,
rights and remedies hereunder and under any of the Security Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent, in its
capacity as Collateral Agent on behalf of the Lenders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, and (b) in the event of a
foreclosure by the Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or other disposition, the
Collateral Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale or other
disposition and the Collateral Agent, as agent for and representative of the Lenders (but not any Lender in its individual capacity
unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or
payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any amount of
the Loans as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at such sale or other
disposition. Amounts received in respect of any Collateral as a result of the enforcement of remedies following an Event of Default
by the Collateral Agent in accordance with this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be applied to the Obligations in
accordance with Section 8.04.
 
Section
9.02       Administrative
Agent Individually.
 
(a)         The person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender
as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term “Lender”
or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include each
person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower
or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account
therefor to the Lenders.
 
(b)         Each
Lender Party understands that the person serving as the Administrative Agent, acting in its individual capacity, and its Affiliates
(collectively, the “Agent’s Group”) are engaged in a wide range of financial services and businesses
(including investment management, financing, securities trading, corporate and investment banking and research) (such services and
businesses are collectively referred to in this Section 9.02 as “Activities”) and may engage
in the Activities with or on behalf of one or more of the Obligors or their respective Affiliates. Furthermore, the Agent’s
Group may, in undertaking the Activities, engage in trading in financial products or undertake other investment businesses for its
own account or on behalf of others (including the Obligors and their Affiliates and including holding, for its own account or on
behalf of others, equity, debt and similar positions in Borrower, another Obligor or their respective Affiliates), including trading
in or holding long, short or derivative positions in securities, loans or other financial products of one or more of the Obligors or
their Affiliates. Each Lender Party understands and agrees that in engaging in the Activities, the Agent’s Group may receive
or otherwise obtain information concerning the Obligors or their Affiliates (including information concerning the ability of the
Obligors to perform their respective Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents) which information may not be
available to any of the Lender Parties that are not members of the Agent’s Group. None of the Administrative Agent nor any
member of the Agent’s Group shall have any duty to disclose to any Lender Party or use on behalf of the Lender Parties, and
shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, any information whatsoever about or derived from the Activities or
otherwise (including any information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or
creditworthiness of any Obligor or any Affiliate of any Obligor) or to account for any revenue or profits obtained in connection
with the Activities, except that the Administrative Agent shall deliver or otherwise make available to each Lender Party such
documents as are expressly required by any Loan Document to be transmitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lender Parties.
 

116
 


 
(c)         Each
Lender Party further understands that there may be situations where members of the Agent’s Group or their respective customers
(including the Obligors and their Affiliates) either now have or may in the future have interests or take actions that may conflict with
the interests of any one or more of the Lender Parties (including the interests of the Lender Parties hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents). Each Lender Party agrees that no member of the Agent’s Group is or shall be required to restrict its activities as
a result of the person serving as Administrative Agent being a member of the Agent’s Group, and that each member of the Agent’s
Group may undertake any Activities without further consultation with or notification to any Lender Party. None of (i) this Agreement
nor any other Loan Document, (ii) the receipt by the Agent’s Group of information (including Information) concerning the Obligors
or their Affiliates (including information concerning the ability of the Obligors to perform their respective Obligations hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents) nor (iii) any other matter shall give rise to any fiduciary, equitable or contractual duties (including
without limitation any duty of trust or confidence) owing by the Administrative Agent or any member of the Agent’s Group to any
Lender Party including any such duty that would prevent or restrict the Agent’s Group from acting on behalf of customers (including
the Obligors or their Affiliates) or for its own account.
 
Section
9.03       Duties
of Administrative Agent; Exculpatory Provisions.
 
(a)         The
Administrative Agent’s duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are solely ministerial and administrative in nature

Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, but shall be required to act or refrain from acting (and shall be fully
protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the written direction of the Required Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the

shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 8.03 or 10.02) or in the absence of its
own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or the event
or events that give or may give rise to any Default unless and until Borrower or any Lender Party shall have given notice to the Administrative
Agent describing such Default and such event or events. except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents to which
it is a party, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Borrower or
any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates
in any capacity.
 
(c)         Neither the Administrative Agent nor any member of the Agent’s Group shall be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into any statement, warranty, representation or other information made or supplied in or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in
connection herewith or therewith or the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the information contained therein, the performance or
observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default,

or document or the perfection or priority of any Lien or security interest created or purported to be created by any collateral document
or the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than (but subject to the foregoing
clause (ii)) to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
 
(d)         Nothing
in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall require the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties to carry out any “know
your customer” or other checks in relation to any person on behalf of any Lender Party and each Lender Party confirms to the Administrative
Agent that it is solely responsible for any such checks it is required to carry out and that it may not rely on any statement in relation
to such checks made by the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties.
 
Section
9.04       Reliance
by Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other
distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper person. The
Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the
proper person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the
making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such
condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless an officer of the Administrative Agent responsible for the transactions contemplated
hereby shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan, and in the case of a Borrowing,
such Lender Party shall not have made available to the Administrative Agent such Lender Party’s ratable portion of such
Borrowing. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for a Loan Party), independent accountants
and other experts selected by it, and shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts and
shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or
experts.
 


118
 

 
Section
9.05       Delegation
of Duties.

perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one
or more sub agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub agent may perform any and all of its
duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. Each such sub agent and the Related Parties
of the Administrative Agent and each such sub agent shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article IX
and Article X (as though such sub agents were the “Administrative Agent” under the Loan Documents)
as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.
 
Section
9.06       Resignation
of Administrative Agent.
 
(a)         The
Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lender Parties and Borrower. Upon receipt of any such
notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right subject to Borrower’s consent (unless an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, and in such case, in consultation with Borrower), to appoint a successor, which shall be a
bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor
shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the
retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (such 30-day period, the “Lender Party Appointment
Period”), then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lender Parties, appoint a successor Administrative
Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above and promptly shall provide notice to Borrower of such appointment (which notice
shall include the name, address, wire transfer information of, and contact person for, the successor Administrative Agent). In
addition and without any obligation on the part of the retiring Administrative Agent to appoint, on behalf of the Lender Parties, a
successor Administrative Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent may at any time upon or after the end of the Lender Party
Appointment Period notify Borrower and the Lender Parties that no qualifying person has accepted appointment as successor
Administrative Agent and the effective date of such retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation which effective date shall be
no earlier than three (3) Business Days after the date of such notice. Upon the resignation effective date established in such
notice and regardless of whether a successor Administrative Agent has been appointed and accepted such appointment, the retiring
Administrative Agent’s resignation shall nonetheless become effective and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to which it is a
party and all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall
instead be made by or to each Lender Party directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative
Agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties as Administrative
Agent of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its
duties and obligations as Administrative Agent hereunder or under such other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as
provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those
payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative
Agent’s resignation hereunder and under such other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section
10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective
Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was
acting as Administrative Agent.
 
(b)         [reserved]
 

119
 

  
Section
9.07       Non-Reliance
on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.
 
(a)         Each Lender Party confirms to the Administrative Agent, each other Lender Party and each of their respective Related Parties
that it (i) possesses (individually or through its Related Parties) such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that
it is capable, without reliance on the Administrative Agent, any other Lender Party or any of their respective Related Parties, of evaluating
the merits and risks (including tax, legal, regulatory, credit, accounting and other financial matters) of (x) entering into this Agreement,
(y) making Loans and other extensions of credit hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (z) in taking or not taking actions hereunder
and thereunder, (ii) is financially able to bear such risks and (iii) has determined that entering into this Agreement and making Loans
and other extensions of credit hereunder and under the other Loan Documents is suitable and appropriate for it.
 
(b)         Each Lender Party acknowledges that (i) it is solely responsible for making its own independent appraisal and investigation
of all risks arising under or in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (ii) that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender Party or any of their respective Related Parties, made its own appraisal and
investigation of all risks associated with, and its own credit analysis and decision to enter into, this Agreement based on such documents
and information, as it has deemed appropriate and (iii) it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any
other Lender Party or any of their respective Related Parties, continue to be solely responsible for making its own appraisal and investigation
of all risks arising under or in connection with, and its own credit analysis and decision to take or not take action under, this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, which may include,
in each case:
 
(i)       the financial condition, status and capitalization of Borrower and each other Obligor;
 


120
 

 
(ii)      the
legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and any other agreement,
arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Loan Document;
 
(iii)     determining
compliance or non-compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan and the form and substance of all evidence delivered
in connection with establishing the satisfaction of each such condition;
 
(iv)     the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of any information delivered by the Administrative Agent, any other Lender Party
or by any of their respective Related Parties under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under
or in connection with any Loan Document.
 
Section
9.08       Withholding Tax.
 
To the extent required by
any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender Party an amount equivalent to any applicable
withholding Tax. Without limiting the provisions of Section 2.18(a) or (c), each Lender Party shall, and does
hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payable in respect thereof within 30 days after demand therefor, against any
and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any single
counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority
as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender
Party for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not property executed, or because
such Lender Party failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction
of withholding tax ineffective). A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender Party by the Administrative
Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender Party hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any
and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative
Agent under this Section 9.08. The agreements in this Section 9.08 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement
of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender Party, the termination of the Commitments and
the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
 
Section
9.09       No
Other Duties, etc.
 
Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, none of the Arrangers listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.
 

121
 

 

Section
9.10       Enforcement.
 
Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection
with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent, or as the Required Lenders may require
or otherwise direct, for the benefit of all the Lenders; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) the
Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative
Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, (b) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance
with, and subject to, the terms of this Agreement, or (c) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on
its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Loan Party under any bankruptcy or insolvency law.
 
Section
9.11       Guaranteed
Cash Management Agreements and Guaranteed Hedge Agreements.
 
No Cash Management Bank or
Hedge Bank that obtains the benefits of Section 8.04, the guaranties provided in Article VII or of any other
guaranty shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan
Document or otherwise in respect of such guaranties (including the release or impairment of any guaranties) other than in its capacity
as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Article IX to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory
arrangements have been made with respect to, Obligations arising under Guaranteed Cash Management Agreements and Guaranteed Hedge Agreements
unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative
Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be.
 
Section
9.12       Credit
Bidding.
 
The Secured Creditors
hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent (including in its capacity as Collateral Agent), at the direction of the
Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in
satisfaction of some or all of the Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase
(either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted
under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar laws
in any other jurisdictions to which a Secured Creditor is subject, or (b) at any other sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral
in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent (including in its capacity as
Collateral Agent) (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law. In connection with any such
credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to the Secured Creditors shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by the
Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders on a ratable basis (with Indebtedness with respect to contingent or
unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of
such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent
interests) for the asset or assets so purchased (or for the equity interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or
vehicles that are issued in connection with such purchase). In connection with any such bid, (i) the Administrative Agent (including
in its capacity as the Collateral Agent) shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful
credit bid to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, (ii) each of the Secured Creditor’s ratable interests in the Obligations
which were credit bid shall be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to be assigned to such vehicle or vehicles for
the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to adopt documents providing for the governance
of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such
acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, shall be governed, directly or
indirectly, by, and the governing documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Required Lenders or their permitted
assignees under the terms of this Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the
case may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the
Required Lenders contained in Section 10.02 of this Agreement), (iii) the Administrative Agent on behalf of such
acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue to each of the Secured Creditors, ratably on account of the relevant
Indebtedness which were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership interests, limited partnership interests or membership
interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and/or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any
Secured Creditor or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an
acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because
the amount of Indebtedness assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of Indebtedness credit bid by the acquisition
vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Secured Creditors pro rata with their original
interest in such Indebtedness and the equity interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of such
Indebtedness shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Creditor or any acquisition vehicle to take any
further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Obligations of each Secured Creditor are deemed assigned to the
acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured Creditor shall execute such documents
and provide such information regarding the Secured Creditor (and/or any designee of the Secured Creditor which will receive
interests in or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in
connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, the formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by such credit bid.

Section
9.13       Erroneous
Payments.
 
(a)         If
the Administrative Agent notifies a Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Creditor, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a
Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Creditor such Lender or Issuing Bank (any such Lender, Issuing Bank, Secured Creditor or other
recipient, a “Payment Recipient”) that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole discretion (whether or not
after receipt of any notice under immediately succeeding clause (b)) that any funds received by such Payment Recipient
from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly
received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Lender, Issuing Bank, Secured Creditor or other Payment Recipient
on its behalf) (any such funds, whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or
otherwise, individually and collectively, an “Erroneous Payment”) and demands the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a
portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of the Administrative Agent and shall be segregated
by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, and such Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured
Creditor shall (or, with respect to any Payment Recipient who received such funds on its behalf, shall cause such Payment Recipient
to) promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such
Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made, in same day funds (in the currency so received), together
with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by
such Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in same day funds at the greater of the Federal
Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation from time to time in effect. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Payment Recipient under this clause
(a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
 

123
 


 
(b)         Without
limiting immediately preceding clause (a), each Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Creditor, or any Person who has received
funds on behalf of a Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Creditor such Lender or Issuing Bank, hereby further agrees that if it receives
a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution
or otherwise) from the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date
from, that specified in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with
respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment
sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates), or (z) that such Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Creditor, or other such
recipient, otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) in each case:
 
(i)       (A) in the case of immediately preceding clauses (x) or (y), an error shall be presumed to have
been made (absent written confirmation from the Administrative Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error has been made (in the case of immediately
preceding clause (z)), in each case, with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment; and
 
(ii)      such
Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Creditor shall (and shall cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to)
promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of such error) notify the Administrative Agent of its receipt
of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Administrative Agent
pursuant to this Section 9.13(b).
 
(c)         Each
Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Creditor hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at
any time owing to such Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Creditor under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the
Administrative Agent to such Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Creditor from any source, against any amount due to the Administrative Agent
under immediately preceding clause (a) or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement.
 

124
 

 

(d)        In
the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Administrative Agent for any reason, after demand therefor
by the Administrative Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender or Issuing Bank that has
received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and/or from any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion
thereof) on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an “Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency”), upon the Administrative
Agent’s notice to such Lender or Issuing Bank at any time, (i) such Lender or Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have assigned its
Loans (but not its Commitments) with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the “Erroneous Payment Impacted Loan”)
in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may specify) (such assignment
of the Loans (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Loan, the “Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment”)
at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by the Administrative Agent in such instance),
and is hereby (together with the Borrower) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption (or, to the extent applicable,
an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Approved Electronic Platform as to which the Administrative
Agent and such parties are participants) with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and such Lender or Issuing Bank
shall deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, (ii) the Administrative Agent as the assignee
Lender shall be deemed to acquire the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (iii) upon such deemed acquisition, the Administrative
Agent as the assignee Lender shall become a Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency
Assignment and the assigning Lender or assigning Issuing Bank shall cease to be a Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, hereunder with
respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification
provisions of this Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender or assigning Issuing Bank
and (iv) the Administrative Agent may reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the Loans subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency
Assignment. The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Loans acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment
and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender or Issuing Bank
shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Loan (or portion thereof), and the Administrative Agent shall retain all other
rights, remedies and claims against such Lender or Issuing Bank (and/or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf).
For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender or Issuing Bank and
such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, each party hereto agrees that, except
to the extent that the Administrative Agent has sold a Loan (or portion thereof) acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency
Assignment, and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent may be equitably subrogated, the Administrative Agent shall be contractually
subrogated to all the rights and interests of the applicable Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Creditor under the Loan Documents with respect
to each Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (the “Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights”).
 


125
 

 
(e)         The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations
owed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect
to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower or any other
Loan Party for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment.
 
(f)          To
the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives,
and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim
by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including without limitation waiver of any defense based
on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine
 
(g)        Each
party’s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 9.13 shall survive the resignation or replacement
of the Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender or Issuing Bank, the termination
of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.

127
 

 
(vii)         Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this clause (a) (unless the Administrative Agent requests that the provisions of clause
(a) be followed) and any other provision in this Agreement or any other Loan Document providing for the delivery of any Approved
Electronic Communication by any other means, the Obligors shall deliver all Approved Electronic Communications to the Administrative
Agent by properly transmitting such Approved Electronic Communications in an electronic/soft medium in a format acceptable to the Administrative
Agent to oploanswebadmin@citigroup.com or such other electronic mail address (or similar means of electronic delivery) as the
Administrative Agent may notify to the applicable Borrower in accordance with this clause (a) above. Nothing in this clause
(a)(viii) shall prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party to deliver any Approved Electronic Communication
to any Obligor in any manner authorized in this Agreement or to request that any Borrower effect delivery in such manner.
 
(b)         Posting
of Approved Electronic Communications. Each of the Lender Parties and each Obligor agree that the Administrative Agent may, but shall
not be obligated to, make the Approved Electronic Communications available to the Lender Parties by posting such Approved Electronic
Communications on IntraLinks™ or a substantially similar electronic platform chosen by the Administrative Agent to be its electronic
transmission system (the “Approved Electronic Platform”).
 
(i)      Although
the Approved Electronic Platform and its primary web portal are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and policies implemented
or modified by the Administrative Agent from time to time (including, as of the Closing Date, a dual firewall and a User ID/Password
Authorization System) and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a single-user-per-deal authorization method whereby each
user may access the Approved Electronic Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the Lender Parties and each Obligor acknowledges
and agrees that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality
and other risks associated with such distribution. In consideration for the convenience and other benefits afforded by such distribution
and for the other consideration provided hereunder, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, each of the Lender Parties
and each Obligor hereby approves distribution of the Approved Electronic Communications through the Approved Electronic Platform and
understands and assumes the risks of such distribution.
 
(ii)      THE
APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”.
NONE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT NOR ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE AGENT’S GROUP WARRANT THE ACCURACY, ADEQUACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE
APPROVED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND EACH EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS
IN THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS
OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY THE AGENT PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS
OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM.
 

128
 

 

(iii)     Each
of the Lender Parties and each Obligor agree that the Administrative Agent may, but (except as may be required by applicable law) shall
not be obligated to, store the Approved Electronic Communications on the Approved Electronic Platform in accordance with the Administrative
Agent’s generally-applicable document retention procedures and policies.
 
(c)         Treatment
of Information.
 
(i)      Certain of the Lenders may enter into this Agreement and take or not take action hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
on the basis of information that does not contain material non-public information with respect to any of the Obligors or their securities
(“Restricting Information”). Other Lenders may enter into this Agreement and take or not take action hereunder
or under the other Loan Documents on the basis of information that may contain Restricting Information. Each Lender Party acknowledges
that United States federal and state securities laws prohibit any person from purchasing or selling securities on the basis of material,
non-public information concerning the such issuer of such securities or, subject to certain limited exceptions, from communicating such
information to any other person. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall, by making any Communications (including
Restricting Information) available to a Lender Party, by participating in any conversations or other interactions with a Lender Party
or otherwise, make or be deemed to make any statement with regard to or otherwise warrant that any such information or Communication does
or does not contain Restricting Information nor shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties be responsible or liable
in any way for any decision a Lender Party may make to limit or to not limit its access to Restricting Information. In particular, none
of the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties (A) shall have, and the Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself and each
of its Related Parties, hereby disclaims, any duty to ascertain or inquire as to whether or not a Lender Party has or has not limited
its access to Restricting Information, such Lender Party’s policies or procedures regarding the safeguarding of material, nonpublic
information or such Lender Party’s compliance with applicable laws related thereto or (B) shall have, or incur, any liability to
any Obligor or Lender Party or any of their respective Related Parties arising out of or relating to the Administrative Agent or any of
its Related Parties providing or not providing Restricting Information to any Lender Party.
 

129
 

 

(ii)      Each
Obligor agrees that all Communications it provides to the Administrative Agent intended for delivery to the Lender Parties whether by
posting to the Approved Electronic Platform or otherwise shall be clearly and conspicuously marked “PUBLIC” if such Communications
do not contain Restricting Information which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word “PUBLIC” shall appear prominently on
the first page thereof, by marking Communications “PUBLIC,” each Obligor shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative
Agent and the Lender Parties to treat such Communications as either publicly available information or not material information (although,
in this latter case, such Communications may contain sensitive business information and, therefore, remain subject to the confidentiality
undertakings of Section 10.13) with respect to such Obligor or its securities for purposes of United States Federal and
state securities laws, all Communications marked “PUBLIC” may be delivered to all Lender Parties and may be made available
through a portion of the Approved Electronic Platform designated “Public Side Information,” and the Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to treat any Communications that are not marked “PUBLIC” as Restricting Information and may post such Communications
to a portion of the Approved Electronic Platform not designated “Public Side Information.” Neither the Administrative Agent
nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible for any statement or other designation by an Obligor regarding whether a Communication
contains or does not contain material non-public information with respect to any of the Obligors or their securities nor shall the Administrative
Agent or any of its Affiliates incur any liability to any Obligor, any Lender Party or any other person for any action taken by the Administrative
Agent or any of its Affiliates based upon such statement or designation, including any action as a result of which Restricting Information
is provided to a Lender Party that may decide not to take access to Restricting Information. Nothing in this Section shall modify or
limit a Lender Party’s obligations under Section 10.13 with regard to Communications and the maintenance of the confidentiality
of or other treatment of Information.
 
(iii)     Each Lender Party acknowledges that circumstances may arise that require it to refer to Communications that might contain
Restricting Information. Accordingly, each Lender Party agrees that it will nominate at least one designee to receive Communications (including
Restricting Information) on its behalf and identify such designee (including such designee’s contact information) on such Lender
Party’s Administrative Questionnaire. Each Lender Party agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time of such Lender
Party’s designee’s e-mail address to which notice of the availability of Restricting Information may be sent by electronic
transmission.
 
(iv)     Each
Lender Party acknowledges that Communications delivered hereunder and under the other Loan Documents may contain Restricting Information
and that such Communications are available to all Lender Parties generally. Each Lender Party that elects not to take access to Restricting
Information does so voluntarily and, by such election, acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and other Lender Parties
may have access to Restricting Information that is not available to such electing Lender Party. None of the Administrative Agent nor
any Lender Party with access to Restricting Information shall have any duty to disclose such Restricting Information to such electing
Lender Party or to use such Restricting Information on behalf of such electing Lender Party, and shall not be liable for the failure
to so disclose or use, such Restricting Information.
 

130
 

 

(v)      The
provisions of the foregoing clauses of this Section are designed to assist the Administrative Agent, the Lender Parties and the
Obligors, in complying with their respective contractual obligations and applicable law in circumstances where certain Lender
Parties express a desire not to receive Restricting Information notwithstanding that certain Communications hereunder or under the
other Loan Documents or other information provided to the Lender Parties hereunder or thereunder may contain Restricting
Information. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties warrants or makes any other statement with respect to
the adequacy of such provisions to achieve such purpose nor does the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties warrant or
make any other statement to the effect that an Obligor’s or Lender Party’s adherence to such provisions will be
sufficient to ensure compliance by such Obligor or Lender Party with its contractual obligations or its duties under applicable law
in respect of Restricting Information and each of the Lender Parties and each Obligor assumes the risks associated therewith.
 
Section
10.02   Waivers; Amendment.
 
(a)         Generally. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder
or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power,
or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision
of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by this Section 10.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver
of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
No notice or demand on Borrower in any case shall entitle Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
 
(b)         Required
Consents. Subject to Section 10.02(c) and (d), Section 2.12 and Section 2.23,
neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified
except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by Borrower and the Administrative
Agent or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative
Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are party thereto, in each case with the written consent of the Required Lenders; provided
that no such agreement shall be effective if the effect thereof would:
 
(i)       increase
the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender (it being understood that no amendment, modification, termination,
waiver or consent with respect to any condition precedent, covenant or Default shall constitute an increase in the Commitment of any
Lender);
 
(ii)      reduce
the principal amount or premium, if any, of any Loan (except in connection with a payment contemplated by clause (ix)
below) or reduce the rate of interest thereon (other than interest pursuant to Section 2.06(c)), or reduce any
Commitment Fees payable hereunder, or change the form or currency of payment of any Obligation, without the written consent of each
Lender directly affected thereby (it being understood that any amendment or modification to the financial definitions in this
Agreement shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest for purposes of this clause (ii));
 


131
 

 
(iii)    change
the scheduled final maturity of any Loan, or any scheduled date of payment (or permitted prepayment) of any Loan, postpone the date for
payment of any interest, premium or fees that constitute Obligations payable hereunder, reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such
payment (other than waiver of any increase in the interest rate pursuant to Section 2.06(c)), or postpone the scheduled
date of expiration of any Commitment beyond the Maturity Date, in any case, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected
thereby;
 
(iv)     increase the maximum duration of Interest Periods in respect of SOFR Borrowings hereunder, without the written consent of
each Lender directly affected thereby;
 
(v)      permit
the assignment or delegation by Borrower of any of its rights or obligations under any Loan Document, without the written consent of
each Lender;
 
(vi)     release
Holdings or any other Guarantor from its guarantee of the Guaranteed Obligations in respect of Obligations, or limit its liability in
respect of such guarantee, without the written consent of each Lender;
 
(vii)    release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents without the written consent
of each Lender;
 
(viii)   change
Section 8.04 without the written consent of each Lender;
 
(ix)     change Section 2.17(b), (c) or (d) in a manner that would alter the pro rata
sharing of payments or setoffs required thereby or any other provision in a manner that would alter the pro rata allocation
among the Lenders of Loan disbursements, including the requirements of Section 2.02(a) and 2.20(d), without
the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby or change the last sentence of Section 2.08 without the written
consent of each Lender;
 
(x)       change
any provision of this Section 10.02(b) or Section 10.02(c), without the written consent of each Lender directly
affected thereby;
 
(xi)     change the percentage set forth in the definition of “Required Lenders” or any other provision
of any Loan Document (including this Section) specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights
thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, other than to increase
such percentage or number or to give any additional Lender or group of Lenders such right to waive, amend or modify or make any such determination
or grant any such consent;
 
(xii)    subordinate
the Obligations to any other obligation, without the written consent of each Lender;
 


132
 

 
(xiii)   change
or waive any provision of Article X as the same applies to the Administrative Agent, or any other provision hereof as the
same applies to the rights or obligations of the Administrative Agent, in each case without the written consent of the Administrative
Agent; or
 
(xiii)   change
or waive any provision hereof relating to Letters of Credit without the written consent of each Issuing Bank.
 
Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein:
 
(A)       no
Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder, except to the extent the
consent of such Lender would be required under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) in the proviso to
the first sentence of this Section 10.02(b);
 
(B)        any
Loan Document may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by Borrower

shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction by final judgment (with any time for appeals having expired) to have resulted from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or result from a claim brought by Borrower or any other Loan Party against an Indemnitee for

each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), such Issuing Bank, Arranger or such Related
Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense
or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount (such indemnity shall be effective whether or not the related losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and related expenses are incurred or asserted by any party hereto or any third party); provided that with respect
to such unpaid amounts owed to any Issuing Bank solely in its capacity as such, only the Lenders shall be required to pay such unpaid
amounts, such payment to be made severally among them based on such Lenders’ Pro Rata Percentage (determined as of the time that
the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought), the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability
or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), any Issuing
Bank or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), such Issuing Bank.
The obligations of the Lenders under this clause (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.17. For purposes
hereof, a Lender’s “pro rata share” shall be determined based upon its share of the sum of the total Revolving Exposure
and unused Commitments at the time.

of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, no party hereto shall assert, and
each party hereto hereby waives, any claim against any other person, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential

other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or

any Borrower’s indemnity or reimbursement obligations to the extent otherwise set forth in this Section 10.03. No
party hereto shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed
by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other

(with any time for appeals having expired) to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such person.
 
(e)            Payments.

in clause (d) of this Section, any Affiliate of each Issuing Bank that issues a Letter of Credit and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the other Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
(b)           Assignments

(i)             Subject
to the conditions set forth in clause (b)(ii) below, any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees who is
an Eligible Assignee all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment
and the Loans (including participations in L/C Obligations) at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:
 
(A)            
Borrower; provided that no consent of Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender Party or an Affiliate
of a Lender Party, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; provided, further,
that Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any assignment requiring its consent unless it shall object thereto by written notice
within seven (7) Business Days after having received notice thereof;
 
(B)             
the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment
of any Revolving Commitment to an assignee that is a Lender with a Revolving Commitment immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment;
and
 
(C)             
the Issuing Banks.
 
(ii)            Assignments in respect of Commitments and Loans shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
 
(A)             Except
in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and the Loans at the time
owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender,
the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable
Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such
assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade
Date) shall not be less than US$10,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of Revolving Loans or Revolving Commitments,
unless each of the Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank and, so long as no Default with respect to Borrower has occurred and is
continuing, Borrower otherwise consent (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
 


136
 

 
(B)             
each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights
and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall
not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate tranches on a non-pro rata basis;
and
 
(C)             
the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together
with a processing and recordation fee of US$3,500 (provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to
waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any Assignment), and the Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
 
Subject to acceptance and
recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to clause (c) of this Section 10.04, from and after
the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and,
to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from
its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights
and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits
of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.18 and 10.03 with respect to facts and circumstances
occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement
that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in
such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 10.04(d).
 
(c)            Register.
The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of Borrower, shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Assumption
delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts
(and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations and any payment made by each Issuing Bank under any applicable Letter of Credit
owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and Borrower, the Administrative Agent, Issuing Banks and the Lender Parties shall treat
each person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender Party hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower and each Issuing Bank (with
respect to Revolving Lenders only), and any Lender (with respect to its own interest only), at any reasonable time and from time to time
upon reasonable prior notice.
 


137
 

 
(d)           Participations.
Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank sell participations
to any person (other than a natural person or Borrower or any of its Affiliates) (each, a “Participant”) in
all or a portion of such Lender’s rights or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment or the
Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations
under this Agreement.
 
Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents
to which it is a party and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of such Loan Documents; provided that
such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification
or waiver described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first proviso to Section 10.02(b)
that affects such Participant. Subject to clause (e) of this Section, Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled
to the benefits of Section 2.13, 2.14 and 2.18 (subject to the requirements and limitations
of those Sections, including the requirements under Section 2.18(e) (it being understood that the documentation required
under Section 2.18(e) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant
also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09 as though it were a Lender; provided such Participant agrees to
be subject to Section 2.17 as though it were a Lender.
 
Each Lender that sells a participation
shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non- fiduciary agent of Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address
of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations
under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation
to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to Borrower or any other person (including the identity of any Participant
or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitment or Loan or its other obligations under any Loan Document)
except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form
under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.
 
The entries in the Participant
Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant
Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
 
(e)            Limitations
on Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.13, 2.14
and 2.18 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold
to such Participant without Borrower’s prior written consent in its sole discretion, except to the extent such entitlement to receive
a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that
sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to
effectuate the provisions of Section 2.19 with respect to any Participant.
 


138
 

 
(f)            Certain
Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement
to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee
or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. In the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans, such Lender may,
without the consent of Borrower, or the Administrative Agent, collaterally assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement, including the Loans and Notes, if any, or any other instrument evidencing its rights as a Lender under this Agreement, to
any holder of, trustee for, or any other representative of holders of, obligations owed or securities issued, by such fund, as security
for such obligations or securities.
 
(g)           Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,”
and words of like import in Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic
form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-
based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Requirement of Law, including the
Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other
similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
 
Section
10.05   Payments Set Aside
 
To the extent that any payment
by or on behalf of the Loan Parties is made to any Lender Party, or any Lender Party exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or
the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Lender Party in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the
obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment
had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and each Issuing Bank severally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from
the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate from time to time
in effect. The obligations of the Lenders and each Issuing Bank under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in
full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
 


139
 

 
Section
10.06   Survival of Agreement.
 
All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by any Loan Party in the Loan Documents to which it is a party and in the certificates or other instruments
delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by
the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans, regardless of
any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have
had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall
continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable
under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Section
2.13, Section 2.14, Section 2.16, Section 2.17, Section 2.18 and Article
X (other than Section 10.13) shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination
of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
 
Section
10.07   Counterparts; Integration;
Effectiveness.
 
This Agreement may be executed
in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which
when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements
with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter
hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except
as provided in Section 5.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative
Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each
of the other parties hereto. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import
herein or any other Loan Document shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each
of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping
system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Requirement of Law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures
in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on
the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
 
Section
10.08   Severability.
 
Any provision of this Agreement
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof;
and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 


140
 

 
Section
10.09   Right of Setoff.
 
(a)            If
an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, and each of their respective Affiliates, is hereby authorized
at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in
whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of Borrower or any other
Loan Party against any and all of the Obligations of Borrower or such Loan Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document to such Lender is a party, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender
different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. Each Lender agrees to notify Borrower and
the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such setoff and application.
 
(b)           [Reserved].
 
(c)           The
rights of each Lender and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
rights of setoff) that such Lender or their respective Affiliates may have.
 
Section
10.10   Governing Law; Jurisdiction;
Consent to Service of Process.
 
(a)           Governing
Law. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and all disputes between the parties under or relating to this Agreement
or the facts or circumstances leading to its execution, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the laws (including statutes of limitation) of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of law principles that
would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction
 
(b)           Submission to Jurisdiction. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property, to the exclusive jurisdiction (subject to the last sentence of this Section 10.10(b)) of the Supreme Court of

appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement
of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action
or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such
Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other
Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any Loan Party or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
 


141
 

 
(c)           Venue. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Requirements of Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in Section 10.10(b). Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, the defense of an inconvenient

out of or relating to any Loan Document, in the manner provided for notices (other than telecopier) in Section 10.01. Nothing
in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted
by applicable Requirements of Law. Certain Loan Parties are not organized under the laws the United States (including the States thereof
and the District of Columbia) and each such Loan Party therefore hereby appoints Borrower as its authorized agent (the “Authorized
Agent”) upon whom process may be served in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or based on this Agreement or the
Obligations which may be instituted in the Supreme Court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, in either case in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, by any Lender hereunder, and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, each such Loan Party hereby waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any such proceeding and expressly and irrevocably accepts and submits, for the benefit of the Lenders from time to time, to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of any such court in respect of any such action, suit or proceeding, for itself and with respect to its properties, revenues
and assets. Such appointment shall be irrevocable unless and until the appointment of a successor authorized agent for such purpose, and
such successor’s acceptance of such appointment, shall have occurred. Each such Loan Party agrees to take any and all actions, including
the filing of any and all documents and instruments, that may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and effect as aforesaid.
Service of process upon the Authorized Agent with respect to any such action shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of process
upon such Loan Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any action against such Loan Party arising out of or based on any of the Loan Documents
to which it is a party may also be instituted in any court in the jurisdiction of organization of such Loan Party, and such Loan Party
expressly accepts the jurisdiction of any such court in any such action. Borrower hereby accepts the foregoing appointment as agent for
service of process.

ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver
and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual

thereto. For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from Holdings, Borrower
or any of their respective Subsidiaries relating to Holdings, Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a non-confidential basis prior
to disclosure by Holdings, Borrower, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, provided that, in the case of information received
from Holdings, Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time
of delivery as confidential. Any person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of
such Information as such person would accord to its own confidential information.
 
Section
10.14   USA PATRIOT ACT Notice and
Customer Verification.
 
(a)            Each
Lender that is subject to the USA PATRIOT ACT and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby
notifies Borrower that pursuant to the “know your customer” regulations and the requirements of the USA PATRIOT ACT,
they are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information includes the name,
address and tax identification number (and other identifying information in the event this information is insufficient to complete
verification) that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to verify the identity of each Loan Party.
This information must be delivered to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent no later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date
and thereafter promptly upon request. This notice is given in accordance with the requirements of the USA PATRIOT ACT and is
effective as to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent.
 
(b)           [Reserved]

Section
10.15   Interest Rate Limitation.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are
treated as interest on such Loan under applicable Requirements of Law (collectively, the “Charges”), shall exceed
the maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved
by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan
hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest
and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall
be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above
the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date
of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.
 
Section
10.16   Obligations Absolute.
 
To the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Requirements of Law, all obligations of the Loan Parties hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:
 
(a)           any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment, composition, liquidation or the like of any Loan
Party;
 
(b)           any
lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto against any Loan Party;
 
(c)           any
change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or
waiver of or any consent to any departure from any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;
 
(d)           any
exchange, release or non-perfection of any other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to any departure from
any guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations;
 
(e)           any
exercise or non-exercise, or any waiver of any right, remedy, power or privilege under or in respect hereof or any Loan Document; or
 
(f)            any
other circumstances which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Loan Parties.
 


144
 

 
Section
10.17   Judgment Currency.
 
(a)           Each
Loan Party’s obligation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to which it is a party to make payments in US Dollars (pursuant
to such obligation, the “Obligation Currency”) shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery
pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any currency other than the Obligation Currency, except to the extent that such
tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by the Administrative Agent or any other respective Lender of the full amount of
the Obligation Currency expressed to be payable to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents. If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against any Loan Party in any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes
necessary to convert into or from any currency other than the Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to
as the “Judgment Currency”) an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the conversion shall be made (i) with
respect to Obligations, at the Dollar Equivalent and (ii) in the case of currencies other than US Dollars, the rate of exchange (as quoted
by the Administrative Agent or if the Administrative Agent does not quote a rate of exchange on such currency, by a known dealer in such
currency designated by the Administrative Agent) determined, in each case, as of the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which
the judgment is given (such Business Day or Banking Day, as applicable, being hereinafter referred to as the “Judgment Currency
Conversion Date”).
 
(b)           If
there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of
the amount due, each Loan Party covenants and agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, such additional amounts, if any (but in any event not
a lesser amount) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when converted at the rate of exchange
prevailing on the date of payment, will produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased with the amount
of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial award at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion
Date.
 
Section
10.18   No Advisory or Fiduciary
Responsibility.
 
Each Loan Party agrees that
nothing in the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship
or fiduciary or other implied duty between the Administrative Agent, any Lender Party or any Affiliate thereof, on the one hand, and such
Loan Party, its stockholders or its Affiliates, on the other. Each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that any of the Administrative Agent,
Arrangers, Issuing Banks, and Lenders may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Loan Parties, their equity holders and/or
their affiliates.
 


145
 

 
Section
10.19   Acknowledgement and Consent
to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions.
 
Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party
hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such
liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and
consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
 
(a)            the
application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder
which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and
 
(b)           the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
 
(i)             a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
 
(ii)            a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial
Institution, its parent entity, undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such
shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document; or
 
(iii)           the
variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution
Authority.
 
Section
10.20   Acknowledgement Regarding
Any Supported QFCs.
 
To the extent that the Loan
Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap Contract or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC
(such support, “QFC Credit Support”, and each such QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the parties
acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated
thereunder, the “Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with
the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by
the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):
 
(a)            in
the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a
proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support
(and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing
such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be
effective under the Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation
and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party
or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under
the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such
Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the Special
Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the
United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect
to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit
Support.
 
(b)           As
used in this Section 10.20, the following terms have the following meanings:
 


146
 

 
“BHC Act Affiliate”
of a party means an “affiliate” (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of
such party.
 
“Covered Entity”
means any of the following: (a) a “covered entity” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R.
 § 252.82(b); (b) a “covered bank” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 47.3(b);
or (c) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b).
 
“Default Right”
has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as
applicable.
 
“QFC”
has the meaning assigned to the term “qualified financial contract” in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C.
5390(c)(8)(D).

EXHIBIT A
[FORM OF] SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT
 
SUBORDINATION
AGREEMENT, dated as of [●], 20[__] (this “Agreement”), by and among CITIBANK, N.A., in its capacity as administrative
agent under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) (in such capacity, together with its successors and assigns in such capacity, the
 “Agent”), NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD., a Bermuda exempted company (“Holdings”), NABORS INDUSTRIES, INC.,
a Delaware corporation (the “Borrower”), the undersigned subsidiaries of Holdings and each other person that becomes
a party hereto after the date hereof in accordance with Section 7 below (the “Specified Subsidiary Guarantors”; and
together with Holdings and the Borrower, collectively, “Obligors”) and [ ___________], solely in its capacity as trustee
under each Initial Indenture (as defined below) (the “Initial Trustee”) for the benefit of the holders of the Initial
Notes (as defined below) and each other representative for the holders of Pari Passu Obligations (as defined below) that becomes a party
hereto after the date hereof in accordance with Section 8 below (each an “Additional Trustee” and, together with the
Initial Trustee, each a “Trustee”).
 
Pursuant
to the Credit Agreement, dated as of January 21, 2022 (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time
to time, the “Credit Agreement”), by and among Holdings, the Borrower, the Specified Subsidiary Guarantors, as “Guarantors”
and the other subsidiaries of the Borrower from time to time party thereto, as “Guarantors”, the lenders and issuing banks
from time to time party thereto and the Agent, among other things, (i) the lenders and issuing banks have provided commitments to make
loans and provide other accommodations to the Borrower and its subsidiaries and (ii) the Specified Subsidiary Guarantors have provided
an unconditional guarantee in full of the Senior Obligations (as defined below). Terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement.
 
The term “Initial
Indentures” shall refer to each of the following (each, an “Initial Indenture”): (i) the indenture dated as of
October 29, 2020 (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “6.500% SPGN Indenture”),
by and among the Borrower, as issuer, Holdings, the Specified Subsidiary Guarantors and certain other subsidiaries of Holdings, as guarantors,
and Wilmington, as trustee; (ii) the indenture dated as of December 1, 2020 (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the “9.000% SPGN Indenture”) by and among the Borrower, as issuer, Holdings, the Specified
Subsidiary Guarantors and certain other subsidiaries of Holdings, as guarantors, and Wilmington, as trustee; and (iii) the indenture dated
as of November 23, 2021 (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “7.375%
SPGN Indenture”), by and among the Borrower, as issuer, Holdings, the Specified Subsidiary Guarantors and certain other subsidiaries
of Holdings, as guarantors, and Wilmington, as trustee. The term “Initial Notes” shall refer to all notes issued pursuant
to the Initial Indentures.
 


 
 

 
From time
to time after the date hereof, one or more of the Specified Subsidiary Guarantors may incur indebtedness, whether as an issuer, borrower,
guarantor or other obligor under one or more other indentures or other instruments to the extent permitted under the Credit Agreement
and each other Indenture (any such indenture or other instrument, an “Additional Indenture” and, together with the
Initial Indenture, each an “Indenture”; and the notes issued under any such Additional Indenture, the “Additional
Notes” and, together with the Initial Notes, collectively, the “Notes”).
 
As a condition
to the Specified Subsidiary Guarantors providing a guarantee of the Subordinated Obligations (as defined below) (the “Subsidiary
Notes Guarantee”), pursuant to Section 6.06(n) of the Credit Agreement, the Obligors and each Trustee are required to execute
and deliver to the Agent counterparts of this Agreement (or in the case of an Additional Trustee, a duly executed joinder hereto in accordance
with Section 8).
 
Accordingly,
the Agent, on behalf of itself, the Lenders and Issuing Banks and any other holder of Obligations (the “Senior Parties”),
the Obligors and each Trustee, on behalf of itself, the holders of the applicable Notes and any other holder of Subordinated Obligations
(together with their respective successors and assigns, collectively, the “Subordinated Parties”), hereby agree as
follows:
 
SECTION 1. Subordination.
 
(a)           Each
Trustee on behalf of itself and the other Subordinated Parties hereby agrees that the Subordinated Obligations shall be subordinate and
junior in right of payment to the (i) Obligations of each Specified Subsidiary Guarantor (whether now existing or from time to time after
the date hereof incurred, assumed, created or arising) and (ii) Permitted Guaranteed Bilateral Letter of Credit Facilities with a Lender
or an affiliate thereof (whether now existing or from time to time after the date hereof incurred, assumed, created or arising), including
the payment of principal, premium (if any), interest (including, without limitation, interest accruing on or after the filing of any
Insolvency Proceeding, whether or not a claim for post-filing interest is allowed or allowable in any such Insolvency Proceeding), fees,
charges, expenses, indemnities, reimbursement obligations and all other amounts payable thereunder or in respect thereof, in each case
whether or not any of the foregoing is allowed or allowable as a claim in any Insolvency Proceeding (collectively, the “Senior
Obligations”). For purposes hereof, “Subordinated Obligations” means all obligations of the Specified Subsidiary
Guarantors to the Subordinated Parties (whether now existing or from time to time after the date hereof incurred, assumed, created or
arising) under each Indenture, including each Subsidiary Notes Guarantee, including, in each case to the extent constituting obligations
thereunder, the payment of principal, premium (if any), interest (including, without limitation, interest accruing on or after the filing
of any Insolvency Proceeding pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, whether or not a claim for post-filing interest is allowed or allowable
in any such Insolvency Proceeding), fees, charges, expenses, indemnities, reimbursement obligations and all other amounts payable thereunder
or in respect thereof, in each case whether or not any of the foregoing is allowed or allowable as a claim in any Insolvency Proceeding.
For purposes hereof, “Discharge of the Senior Obligations” shall mean that the Senior Obligations have been indefeasibly
paid in full in cash and all commitments of the Senior Parties under the Loan Documents have been terminated (other than any inchoate
obligations for which no claim has been asserted).
 


2 
 

 
(b)           The Obligors, each Trustee and the other Subordinated Parties agree that no payment (whether directly, by purchase, redemption
or exercise of any right of setoff or otherwise) in respect of the Subordinated Obligations, whether as principal, interest or otherwise,
and whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made by or on behalf of any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor or received, accepted
or demanded from or on behalf of any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of any Subordinated Party
(other than a payment or distribution in the form of debt or equity securities that are subordinated to the Senior Obligations at least
to the same extent as the Subordinated Obligations (“Permitted Junior Securities”)), until Discharge of the Senior
Obligations. In the event that any payment by, or on behalf of, or distribution of the assets or other property of, or any equity securities
or debt securities issued by, any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor of any kind or character, whether in cash, securities or other property,
and whether directly, by purchase, redemption, exercise of any right of setoff or otherwise (other than a payment or distribution in the
form of Permitted Junior Securities), including without limitation, in connection with a plan of reorganization or other Insolvency Proceeding
with respect to such Specified Subsidiary Guarantor, shall be received by or on behalf of any Subordinated Party or any Affiliate thereof
at a time when such payment or distribution is prohibited by this Agreement, such payment or distribution shall be held by any Subordinated
Party or its Affiliate in trust (segregated from other property of any Subordinated Party or its Affiliate) for the benefit of, and shall
forthwith be paid over to, the Agent, for the benefit of the Senior Parties, until the Discharge of the Senior Obligations. For the avoidance
of doubt, the foregoing does not limit the ability of Holdings to make payments of principal, premium (if any), interest, fees, charges,
expenses, indemnities, reimbursement obligations and other amounts payable in respect of the Subordinated Obligations.
 
(c)           The
provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the occurrence of an Insolvency Proceeding (as defined
below) against any Obligor or any of its properties or assets until the Discharge of the Senior Obligations. Upon any distribution of
the assets of a Specified Subsidiary Guarantor or upon any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization of such Specified Subsidiary
Guarantor, whether in bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement or receivership proceedings or otherwise, or upon any assignment
for the benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of the assets and liabilities of such Specified Subsidiary Guarantor, or otherwise
(any of the foregoing, an “Insolvency Proceeding”):
 
(i)            the
Senior Parties shall first be entitled to Discharge of the Senior Obligations before the Subordinated Parties shall be entitled to receive
any payment or distribution on account of the Subordinated Obligations, whether of principal, interest or otherwise; and
 
(ii)           any
payment by, or on behalf of, or distribution of the assets of, or any debt or equity securities issued by, such Specified Subsidiary
Guarantor of any kind or character, whether in cash, securities or other property, to which any Subordinated Party would be entitled
except for the provisions of this Section 1 shall be paid or delivered by the Person making such payment or distribution (whether
a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver, custodian or liquidating trustee or otherwise) directly to the Agent, for the benefit of the Senior
Parties, until Discharge of the Senior Obligations.
 


3 
 

 
In addition, each Trustee, agrees
that in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding (i) the Agent, on behalf of the Senior Parties, is irrevocably authorized and empowered
(in its own name or in the name of the Subordinated Parties or otherwise), but shall have no obligation, to demand, sue for, collect and
receive every payment or distribution referred to in the preceding sentence and give acquittance therefor and to file claims and proofs
of claim and take such other action as the Agent may deem necessary or advisable for the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights
or interest of the Senior Parties and (ii) each Subordinated Party shall duly and promptly take such action as the Agent, on behalf of
the Senior Parties, may request to (A) collect amounts in respect of the applicable Subordinated Obligations for the account of the Senior
Parties and to file appropriate claims or proofs of claim in respect of such Subordinated Obligations, (B) execute and deliver to the
Agent such irrevocable powers of attorney, assignments or other instruments as the Agent, on behalf of the Senior Parties, may request
in order to enable the Agent to enforce any and all claims with respect to the Subordinated Obligations and (C) collect and receive any
and all payments or distributions which may be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to the applicable Subordinated Obligations.
A copy of this Agreement may be filed with any court as evidence of the Senior Parties’ right, power and authority hereunder.
 
(d)           The
Obligors and each Subordinated Party agree that, prior to the Discharge of the Senior Obligations, no Subordinated Party may take any
Enforcement Action against any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor without the prior written consent of the Agent (acting upon the direction
of the Required Lenders), unless:
 
(i)            the
occurrence of, with respect to such Specified Subsidiary Guarantor, an Insolvency Proceeding;
 
(ii)           the
holders of Senior Obligations have taken any Enforcement Action in relation to such Specified Subsidiary Guarantor; or
 
(iii)          an
event of default has occurred under the applicable Indenture in respect of the applicable Subordinated Obligations (a “Subordinated
Debt Default”); and
 
(A)           the
applicable Subordinated Parties have provided notice of the Subordinated Debt Default to the Senior Parties in accordance with Section
11 hereof;
 
(B)            a
period of not less than (i) 90 days (in the case of a payment default) or (ii) or 179 days (in the case of a non-payment default) has
passed from the date the Agent and the Senior Parties were first notified of the Subordinated Debt Default (a “Standstill Period”);
and
 
(C)            at
the end of the Standstill Period, the Subordinated Debt Default is continuing and has not been cured or waived.
 


4 
 

 
For the purposes hereof, “Enforcement
Action” means, in relation to or with respect to any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor, any action (whether taken by the relevant
creditor or creditors or an agent or trustee on its or their behalf) to: (i) demand payment, declare prematurely due and payable or otherwise
seek to accelerate payment of all or any part of the Subordinated Obligations, (ii) recover all or any part of the Subordinated Obligations
(including, by exercising any rights of set-off or combination of accounts), (iii) exercise or enforce any rights under or pursuant to
the Subsidiary Notes Guarantee, (iv) commence legal proceedings against such Specified Subsidiary Guarantor or (v) commence, or take any
other steps which could lead to the commencement of, an Insolvency Proceeding concerning such Specified Subsidiary Guarantor. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no Subordinated Party may in any Insolvency Proceeding concerning any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor: (i) oppose any sale
of assets (including bidding procedures relating thereto) with respect to such Specified Subsidiary Guarantor; (ii) propose any debtor
in possession financing or oppose any debtor in possession financing or use of cash collateral with respect to such Specified Subsidiary
Guarantor, in each case without the consent of the Agent, acting on behalf of the Senior Parties; (iii) seek appointment of a trustee
or examiner with respect to such Specified Subsidiary Guarantor; or (iv) propose, sponsor, vote in favor of, or otherwise support any
plan of reorganization or liquidation with respect to such Specified Subsidiary Guarantor unless such plan (a) provides for Discharge
of the Senior Obligations on or before the effective date of such plan or (b) the Agent, on behalf of the Senior Parties has provided
its prior written consent with respect to such plan.
 
(e)           Each
Trustee and the other Subordinated Parties waive all rights of subrogation they may have with respect to any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor
under the Subordinated Guaranty until the Discharge of the Senior Obligations, and, as between and among such Specified Subsidiary Guarantor,
its creditors (other than the Senior Parties) and the Subordinated Parties, no such payment or distribution made to the Senior Parties
by virtue of this Agreement that otherwise would have been made to the Subordinated Parties shall be deemed to be a payment by such Specified
Subsidiary Guarantor on account of the Subordinated Obligations, it being understood that the provisions of this paragraph (e)
are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Subordinated Parties and the Senior Parties.
 
(f)            Each
Subordinated Party and Specified Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that each Indenture and all other instruments (including the Notes) or records
(other than book entry records) now or hereafter creating or evidencing the Subordinated Obligations, whether upon refunding, extension,
renewal, refinancing, replacement or otherwise, shall contain the following language:
 
“Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, none of the indebtedness created or evidenced by this instrument or record shall become
due or be paid or payable by any [Specified Subsidiary Guarantor], except to the extent permitted under the Subordination Agreement
dated as of [DATE], among Nabors Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Nabors Industries Ltd., a Bermuda exempted
company, the [Specified Subsidiary Guarantors], the Trustee, and Citibank, N.A, as administrative agent under the 2022 Revolving
Credit Facility1, which is attached as
Exhibit [●] to the Indenture, which Subordination Agreement is incorporated herein with the same effect as if fully set forth
herein”;
 

 
1 Term to be updated to reference the appropriate
defined term in future Indentures and instruments.
 


5 
 

 
or shall otherwise refer to and
be subject in all respects to the terms of this Agreement in a manner acceptable to the Agent.
 
(g)           For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights of payment relative among the Initial Notes and any Additional
Notes which shall rank of equal priority in payment as to each other, unless otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable holders thereof.
 
SECTION 2. Waivers and Consents.
 
(a)           Each
Trustee and the other Subordinated Parties waive the right to compel that any assets or property of any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor
be applied in any particular order to discharge the Senior Obligations. Each Trustee and the other Subordinated Parties expressly waive
the right to require the Senior Parties to proceed against any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor, or to pursue any other remedy in any Senior
Party’s power which the Subordinated Parties cannot pursue and which would lighten the Subordinated Parties’ burden,
notwithstanding that the failure of any Senior Party to do so may thereby prejudice each Subordinated Party. Each Trustee and the other
Subordinated Parties agree that they shall not be discharged, exonerated or have their respective obligations hereunder to the Senior
Parties reduced by any Senior Party’s delay in proceeding against or enforcing any remedy against any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor;
by any Senior Party releasing any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor from all or any part of the Senior Obligations; or by the discharge
of any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor by operation of law or otherwise, with or without the intervention or omission of a Senior Party.
Any Senior Party’s vote to accept or reject any plan of reorganization relating to any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor, or any Senior
Party’s receipt on account of the Senior Obligations other than Discharge of Senior Obligations, shall not discharge, exonerate,
or reduce the obligations of any Subordinated Party hereunder to the Senior Parties.
 
(b)           Each
Trustee and the other Subordinated Parties waive all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Senior Parties,
even though that election of remedies, including any nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for the Senior Obligations, has
impaired the value of each Subordinated Party’s rights of subrogation, reimbursement or contribution against any Specified Subsidiary
Guarantor. Each Subordinated Party expressly waives any rights or defenses it may have by reason of protection afforded to any Specified
Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to the Senior Obligations pursuant to any anti-deficiency laws or other laws of similar import which
limit or discharge the principal debtor’s indebtedness upon judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure of real property or personal property
securing the Senior Obligations.
 


6 
 

 
(c)           Each
Trustee and the other Subordinated Parties agree that, without the necessity of any reservation of rights against any of them, and
without notice to or further assent by any of them, any demand for payment of any Senior Obligations made by a Senior Party may be
rescinded in whole or in part by any Senior Party, and any Senior Obligation may be continued, and the Senior Obligations, or the
liability of any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor or any other guarantor or any other party upon or for any part thereof or right of
offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, modified, accelerated, compromised,
waived, surrendered, or released by the Senior Parties, in each case without notice to or further assent by any Subordinated Party
(to the extent contemplated by the Indenture), which will remain bound under this Agreement and without impairing, abridging,
releasing or affecting the subordination and other agreements provided for herein.
 
(d)           Each
Trustee and the other Subordinated Parties waive any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Senior
Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Senior Parties upon this Agreement. The Senior Obligations, and any of them, shall
be deemed conclusively to have been created, contracted or incurred and the consent given to create the obligations of the Specified
Subsidiary Guarantors in respect of the Subordinated Obligations in reliance upon this Agreement, and all dealings between the Specified
Subsidiary Guarantors and the Senior Parties shall be deemed to have been consummated in reliance upon this Agreement. Each Subordinated
Party acknowledges and agrees that the Senior Parties have relied upon the subordination and other agreements provided for herein in
consenting to the Subordinated Obligations. Each Subordinated Party waives notice of or proof of reliance on this Agreement and protest,
demand for payment and notice of default.
 
SECTION 3.
Senior Obligations Unconditional. All rights and interests of the Senior Parties hereunder, and all agreements and obligations
of each Subordinated Party and each Specified Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder, shall remain in full force and effect irrespective of:
 

(a)any lack of validity or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents;
 
(b)           any
change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Senior Obligations, or any amendment or
waiver or other modification, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, of, or consent to departure from, any of the Loan Documents;
or
 
(c)           any other circumstances that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor
in respect of the Senior Obligations, or of each Subordinated Party or any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of this Agreement.
 
SECTION 4. Representations
and Warranties. Each Trustee represents and warrants to the Agent, for the benefit of the Senior Parties, that:
 
(a)           It has the power and authority to execute and deliver and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and has taken all necessary
action to authorize its execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement.
 


7 
 

 

 
(b)               This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Trustee and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each
Subordinated Party, enforceable against each in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles of equity,
regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
 
(c)               
No consent or authorization of filing with, or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority, is required in connection
with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement.
 
SECTION 5. Waiver of Claims.
 
(a)               
To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Subordinated Party waives any claim it might have against the Senior Parties with
respect to, or arising out of, any action or failure to act or any error of judgment, negligence, or mistake or oversight whatsoever on
the part of the Senior Parties or their directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates with respect to any exercise of rights or
remedies under Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents. Neither the Senior Parties nor any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents or Affiliates shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon guarantee of the Senior Obligations by
Specified Subsidiary Guarantors or for any delay in doing so.
 
(b)              
Each Trustee and the other Subordinated Parties, each for itself and on behalf of its successors and assigns, respectively, hereby
waive any and all now existing or hereafter arising rights it may have to require the Senior Parties to marshal assets for the benefit
of each other Subordinated Party, or to otherwise direct the timing, order or manner of any sale, collection or other enforcement of the
Senior Obligations. The Senior Parties are under no duty or obligation, and each Trustee and the other Subordinated Parties hereby waive
any right it may have to compel the Senior Parties, to pursue any Obligor or other Person who may be liable for the Senior Obligations.
 
SECTION 6.
Further Assurances. Each Subordinated Party and Specified Subsidiary Guarantor, at the expense of the Obligors and at any time
from time to time, upon the written request of the Agent shall promptly and duly execute and deliver such further instruments and documents
and take such further actions as the Agent reasonably may request for the purposes of obtaining or preserving the full benefits of this
Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted.

any Specified Subsidiary Guarantor, execute and deliver a joinder to this Agreement in substantially the form attached as Exhibit
B hereto. From and after delivery of such joinder, such representative shall be a “Trustee” for all purposes of this
Agreement as if originally party hereto on the date hereof.
 
SECTION 9.
Provisions Define Relative Rights. This Agreement is intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Senior
Parties on the one hand and the Subordinated Parties and the Specified Subsidiary Guarantors on the other, and no other Person shall have

such earlier date). The Credit Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

and delivered by it and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms and (b)
the Additional Guarantor will obtain benefits from the extensions of credit under the Credit Agreement.
 

 
 

 

SECTION 3. This
Joinder may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an

any one or more of the provisions contained in this Joinder should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and in the Credit Agreement shall not in any way be affected
or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of
itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties hereto shall endeavor in good faith negotiations
to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible
to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.
 
SECTION 9. All communications
and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in Section 10.01 of the Credit Agreement.
 
SECTION 10. Additional
Guarantor agrees that Administrative Agent shall be entitled to reimbursement of its expenses incurred hereunder and indemnity for its

Priorities and Agreements with Respect to Shared Collateral
 
Section
2.01          Subordination.
Notwithstanding the date, time, manner or order of filing or recordation of any document or instrument or grant, attachment or
perfection of any Liens granted to any Junior Representative or any Junior Priority Debt Parties on the Shared Collateral or of any
Liens granted to the Senior Representative or any other Senior Secured Party on the Shared Collateral (or any actual or alleged
defect in any of the foregoing) and notwithstanding any provision of the UCC, any applicable law, any Junior Priority Debt Document
or any Senior Debt Document or any other circumstance whatsoever, each Junior Representative, on behalf of itself and each Junior
Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, hereby agrees that (a) any Lien on the Shared Collateral securing or
purporting to secure the Senior Obligations now or hereafter held by or on behalf of the Senior Representative or any other Senior
Secured Party or other agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, statute, operation of law,
subrogation or otherwise, shall have priority over and be senior in all respects and prior to any Lien on the Shared Collateral
securing or purporting to secure any Junior Priority Debt Obligations and (b) any Lien on the Shared Collateral securing or

Person or otherwise subordinated, voided, avoided, invalidated or lapsed.

Section
2.02          No
Payment Subordination; Nature of Senior Lender Claims.
 
(a)              
Except as otherwise set forth herein, the subordination of Liens securing Junior Priority Debt Obligations to Liens securing
Senior Obligations set forth in Section 2.01 affects only the relative priority of those Liens and all Proceeds thereof and does not subordinate
the Junior Priority Debt Obligations in right of payment to the Senior Obligations; provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that
all payments in respect of Shared Collateral and all Proceeds thereof shall be subject to Section 4.01. Except as otherwise set forth
herein, nothing in this Agreement will affect the entitlement of the Junior Priority Debt Parties to receive and retain required payments
of interest, principal, and other amounts in respect of Junior Priority Debt Obligations unless the receipt is expressly prohibited by,
or results from the Junior Priority Debt Parties’ breach of, this Agreement.
 
(b)               Each
Junior Representative, on behalf of itself and each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, acknowledges
that (i) the Senior Obligations are revolving in nature and that the amount thereof that may be outstanding at any time or from time
to time may be increased or reduced and subsequently reborrowed, (ii) the terms of the Senior Debt Documents and the Senior
Obligations may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, and the Senior Obligations, or a portion thereof, may be Refinanced
from time to time and (iii) subject to the provisions of Section 5.03(a) of this Agreement, the aggregate amount of the Senior
Obligations may be increased, in each case, without notice to or consent by the Junior Representatives or the Junior Priority Debt
Parties and without affecting the provisions hereof. The Lien priorities provided for in Section 2.01 shall not be altered or
otherwise affected by any amendment, supplement or other modification, or any Refinancing, of either the Senior Obligations or the
Junior Priority Debt Obligations, or any portion thereof. As between Holdings and the other Grantors and the Junior Priority Debt
Parties, the foregoing provisions will not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of Holdings and the Grantors contained in any
Junior Priority Debt Document with respect to the incurrence of additional Senior Obligations.
 
Section
2.03          Prohibition
on Contesting Liens. Each of the Junior Representatives, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior
Priority Debt Facility, agrees that it shall not (and hereby waives any right to) contest or support any other Person in contesting, in
any proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the validity, extent, perfection, priority or enforceability of any
Lien securing, or the allowability of any claims asserted with respect to, the Senior Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or
on behalf of the Senior Representative or any of the other Senior Secured Parties or other agent or trustee therefor in any Senior Collateral.
The Senior Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Senior Secured Party under its Senior Facility, agrees that it shall not (and
hereby waives any right to) contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding), the validity, extent, perfection, priority or enforceability of any Lien securing, or the allowability of any claims asserted
with respect to, any Junior Priority Debt Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or on behalf of any Junior Representative or any
of the Junior Priority Debt Parties in the Junior Priority Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision in this Agreement shall
be construed to prevent or impair the rights of the Senior Representative to enforce this Agreement (including the priority of the Liens
securing the Senior Obligations as provided in Section 2.01) or any of the Senior Debt Documents.
 
Section
2.04          No
New Liens. Subject to the terms hereof, the parties hereto agree that, so long as the Discharge of Senior Obligations has not
occurred, none of the Grantors shall (a) grant or permit any additional Liens on any asset or property of any Grantor to secure any
Junior Priority Debt Obligation unless it has granted, or concurrently therewith grants, a Lien on such asset or property of such
Grantor to secure the Senior Obligations or (b) grant or permit any additional Liens on any asset or property of any Grantor to
secure the Senior Obligation unless it has granted, or concurrently therewith grants, a Lien on such asset or property of such
Grantor to secure the Junior Priority Debt Obligations. If any Junior Representative or any Junior Priority Debt Party shall hold
any Lien on any assets or property of any Grantor securing any Junior Priority Debt Obligations that are not also subject to the
first-priority Liens securing all Senior Obligations under the Senior Collateral Documents, such Junior Representative or Junior
Priority Debt Party (i) shall notify the Senior Representative promptly upon becoming aware thereof and, unless such Grantor shall
promptly grant a similar Lien on such assets or property to the Senior Representative as security for the Senior Obligations, shall
assign such Lien to the Senior Representative as security for all Senior Obligations for the benefit of the Senior Secured Parties
(but may retain a junior lien on such assets or property subject to the terms hereof) and (ii) until such assignment or such grant
of a similar Lien to the Senior Representative, shall be deemed to hold and have held such Lien for the benefit of the Senior
Representative and the other Senior Secured Parties as security for the Senior Obligations. The parties hereto further agree that so
long as the Discharge of Senior Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding has been
commenced by or against any of the Grantors, if any Junior Priority Debt Party shall acquire or hold any Lien on any assets of any
Grantor securing any Junior Priority Debt Obligation which assets are not also subject to the first priority Lien of the Senior
Secured Parties under the Senior Debt Documents, then, without limiting any other rights and remedies available to the Senior
Representative or the other Senior Secured Parties, the Junior Representative, on behalf of itself and the Junior Priority Debt
Parties, agrees that any amounts received by or distributed to any of them pursuant to or as a result of Liens so granted shall be
subject to Section 4.02.

Section
2.05          Perfection
of Liens. Except for the limited agreements of the Senior Representative pursuant to Section 5.06 hereof, none of the Senior Representative
or the Senior Secured Parties shall be responsible for perfecting and maintaining the perfection of Liens with respect to the Shared Collateral
for the benefit of the Junior Representatives or the Junior Priority Debt Parties. The provisions of this Agreement are intended solely
to govern the respective Lien priorities as between the Senior Secured Parties and the Junior Priority Debt Parties and shall not impose
on the Senior Representative, the Senior Secured Parties, the Junior Representatives, the Junior Priority Debt Parties or any agent or
trustee therefor any obligations in respect of the disposition of Proceeds of any Shared Collateral which would conflict with prior perfected
claims therein in favor of any other Person or any order or decree of any court or governmental authority or any applicable law.
 
Section
2.06          Certain
Cash Collateral. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other Senior Debt Documents or Junior Priority Debt Documents to
the contrary, collateral consisting of cash and cash equivalents pledged to secure Senior Obligations consisting of reimbursement obligations
in respect of Letters of Credit or otherwise held by the Senior Representative pursuant to Section 2.10(b), 2.21(d), 2.21(f)(ii), 2.21(g)
or 2.22(h)(i) of the First Lien Credit Agreement (or any equivalent successor provision) shall be applied as specified in the First Lien
Credit Agreement and will not constitute Shared Collateral.

any Senior Secured Party either is a party or may have rights as a third party beneficiary, or any other exercise by any such party
of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral under the Senior Debt Documents or otherwise in respect of the Senior
Collateral or the Senior Obligations, or (z) object to the forbearance by the Senior Secured Parties from bringing or pursuing any
foreclosure proceeding or action or any other exercise of any rights or remedies relating to the Shared Collateral in respect of

and to determine and direct the time, method and place for exercising any such rights, enforcing any such remedies or conducting any
proceeding with respect to any such exercise or enforcement with respect to the Shared Collateral without any consultation with or
the consent of any Junior Representative or any Junior Priority Debt Party; provided, however, that any Junior
Representative or any Junior Priority Debt Party may exercise any or all such rights after the passage of a period of 180 days from
the date of delivery of a notice in writing to the Senior Representative of such Junior Representative’s or Junior Priority
Debt Party’s intention to exercise its right to take such actions which notice shall specify that an “Event of
Default” as defined in the applicable Junior Priority Debt Documents has occurred and as a result of such “Event of
Default”, the principal and interest under such Junior Priority Debt Documents have become due and payable in full (whether as
a result of acceleration or otherwise) (the “Junior Priority Standstill Period”) unless a Senior Representative
has commenced and is diligently pursuing remedies with respect to all or a material part of the Shared Collateral (or such exercise
of remedies is stayed by applicable Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings); provided, further, that (A) in any
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding commenced by or against Holdings or any other Grantor, any Junior Representative may file a
claim, proof of claim, or statement of interest with respect to the Junior Priority Debt Obligations under its Junior Priority Debt
Facility, (B) any Junior Representative may take any action (not adverse to the prior Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the
Senior Obligations or the rights of the Senior Representative or the Senior Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof)
in order to create, prove, perfect, preserve or protect (but not enforce) its rights in, and perfection and priority of its Lien on,

any judicial foreclosure proceeding or other judicial lien enforcement proceeding with respect to the Shared Collateral initiated by
the Senior Representative or any other Senior Secured Party to the extent that any such action could not reasonably be expected, in
any material respect, to restrain, hinder, limit, delay for any material period or otherwise interfere with the exercise of remedies
by the Senior Representative or such other Senior Secured Party (it being understood that neither Designated Junior Representative
nor any other Junior Priority Debt Party shall be entitled to receive any Proceeds thereof unless otherwise expressly permitted
herein), and (H) any Junior Representative and any Junior Priority Debt Party may exercise any remedies after the termination of the
Junior Priority Standstill Period if and to the extent specifically permitted by this Section 3.01(a). Any recovery by any Junior
Priority Debt Party pursuant to the preceding clause (H) shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement. In exercising rights and
remedies with respect to the Senior Collateral, the Senior Representative and the Senior Secured Parties may enforce the provisions
of the Senior Debt Documents and exercise remedies thereunder, all in such order and in such manner as they may determine in the
exercise of their sole discretion. Such exercise and enforcement shall include the rights of an agent appointed by them to sell or

(ii) each Junior Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility,
hereby waives any and all rights it or any such Junior Priority Debt Party may have as a junior lien creditor or otherwise to object to
the manner in which the Senior Representative or the Senior Secured Parties seek to enforce or collect the Senior Obligations or the Liens
granted on any of the Senior Collateral, regardless of whether any action or failure to act by or on behalf of the Senior Representative
or any other Senior Secured Party is adverse to the interests of the Junior Priority Debt Parties.
 
(d)              
Each Junior Representative hereby acknowledges and agrees that no covenant, agreement or restriction contained in any Junior
Priority Debt Document shall be deemed to restrict in any way the rights and remedies of the Senior Representative or the Senior Secured

Junior Representative (or any Person authorized by it) shall have the exclusive right to exercise any right or remedy with respect to
the Collateral, and the Designated Junior Representative (or any Person authorized by it) shall have the exclusive right to direct the
time, method and place of exercising or conducting any proceeding for the exercise of any right or remedy available to the Junior Priority
Debt Parties with respect to the Collateral, or of exercising or directing the exercise of any trust or power conferred on the Junior
Representatives, or for the taking of any other action authorized by the Junior Priority Collateral Documents; provided, that nothing
in this Section shall impair the ability of the Junior Representative and the Junior Priority Debt Parties to exercise any of their rights
or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral to the extent permitted by Section 3.01(a); provided, further that nothing
in this Section shall impair the right of any Junior Representative or other agent or trustee acting on behalf of the Junior Priority
Debt Parties to take such actions with respect to the Collateral after the Discharge of Senior Obligations as may be otherwise required
or authorized pursuant to any intercreditor agreement governing the Junior Priority Debt Parties or the Junior Priority Debt Obligations.

Debt Facility, agrees that, unless and until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, it will not commence, or join with any
Person (other than the Senior Secured Parties and the Senior Representative upon the request of the Senior Representative) in commencing,
any enforcement, collection, execution, levy or foreclosure action or proceeding with respect to any Lien held by it in the Shared Collateral
under any of the Junior Priority Debt Documents or otherwise in respect of the Junior Priority Debt Obligations.
 
Section

to take or threaten to take any action with respect to the Shared Collateral (including any attempt to realize upon or enforce any remedy

Party (in its or their own name or in the name of Holdings or any other Grantor) may obtain relief against such Junior Representative
or such Junior Priority Debt Party by injunction, specific performance or other appropriate equitable relief. Each Junior Representative,
on behalf of itself and each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, hereby (i) agrees that the Senior Secured
Parties’ damages from the actions of the Junior Representatives or any Junior Priority Debt Party may at that time be difficult
to ascertain and may be irreparable and waives any defense that Holdings, any other Grantor or the Senior Secured Parties cannot demonstrate
damage or be made whole by the awarding of damages and (ii) irrevocably waives any defense based on the adequacy of a remedy at law and
any other defense that might be asserted to bar the remedy of specific performance in any action that may be brought by the Senior Representative

Subject to the penultimate sentence of this Section 5.01(a), each Junior Representative, for itself and on behalf of each
Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, agrees that, in the event of a sale, transfer or other disposition
of any specified item of Shared Collateral (including all or substantially all of the equity interests of any subsidiary of Holdings)
(a “Disposition”), the Liens granted to the Junior Representatives and the Junior Priority Debt Parties upon such Shared
Collateral to secure Junior Priority Debt Obligations shall terminate or shall be released, automatically and without any further action,
concurrently with the termination or release of all Liens granted upon such Shared Collateral to secure Senior Obligations, provided
that the parties’ respective Liens shall attach to the net proceeds of such Disposition with the same Lien priorities as provided
in this Agreement to the extent such proceeds are not otherwise utilized to permanently reduce the Senior Obligations. Upon delivery to
a Junior Representative of an Officer’s Certificate stating that any such termination or release of Liens securing the Senior Obligations
has become effective (or shall become effective concurrently with such termination or release of the Liens granted to the Junior Priority
Debt Parties and the Junior Representatives) and any necessary or proper instruments of termination or release prepared by Holdings, any
other Grantor, such Junior Representative will promptly execute, deliver or acknowledge, at Holdings’ or the other Grantor’s
sole cost and expense, such instruments to evidence such termination or release of the Liens; provided, however that such
Officer’s Certificate shall not be required for any termination or release in connection with the exercise of remedies following
an event of default. Nothing in this Section 5.01(a) will be deemed to (x) affect any agreement of a Junior Representative, for itself
and on behalf of the Junior Priority Debt Parties under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, to release the Liens on the Junior Priority
Collateral as set forth in the relevant Junior Priority Debt Documents or (y) except in the case of a Disposition in connection with the
exercise of secured creditors’ rights and remedies, require the release of Liens granted upon such Shared Collateral to secure Junior
Priority Debt Obligations if such Disposition is not permitted under the terms of the Junior Priority Debt Documents. If in connection
with any enforcement action or other exercise of rights and remedies by the Senior Representative, in each case, prior to a Discharge
of Senior Obligations, the equity interests of any Person are foreclosed upon or otherwise disposed of and such Senior Representative
releases its Lien on the property or assets of such Person, then the liens of each Junior Representative and Junior Priority Debt Parties
will be released to the same extent as the Liens of such Senior Representative and Senior Secured Parties are released.
 
(b)               Each
Junior Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, hereby
irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Senior Representative and any officer or agent of the Senior Representative, with full
power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of
such Junior Representative or such Junior Priority Debt Party or in the Senior Representative’s own name, from time to time in
the Senior Representative’s discretion, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of Section 5.01(a), to take any and all
appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments that may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the
purposes of Section 5.01(a), including any termination statements, endorsements or other instruments of transfer or release.
 
(c)              
Unless and until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, each Junior Representative, for itself and on behalf
of each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, hereby consents to the application, whether prior to or after
an event of default under any Senior Debt Document of Proceeds of Shared Collateral to the repayment of Senior Obligations pursuant to
the Senior Debt Documents, provided that nothing in this Section 5.01(c) shall be construed to prevent or impair the rights of
the Junior Representatives or the Junior Priority Debt Parties to receive proceeds in connection with the Junior Priority Debt Obligations
not otherwise in contravention of this Agreement.
 
(d)              
Subject to Sections 5.06(a) and 5.06(f), notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Junior Priority Collateral Document,
in the event the terms of a Senior Collateral Document and a Junior Priority Collateral Document each require any Grantor to (i) make
any payment in respect of any item of Shared Collateral to, (ii) deliver or afford control over any item of Shared Collateral to, or deposit
any item of Shared Collateral with, (iii) register ownership of any item of Shared Collateral in the name of or make an assignment of
ownership of any Shared Collateral or the rights thereunder to, (iv) cause any securities intermediary, commodity intermediary or other
Person acting in a similar capacity to agree to comply, in respect of any item of Shared Collateral, with instructions or orders from,
or to treat, in respect of any item of Shared Collateral, as the entitlement holder, (v) hold any item of Shared Collateral in trust for
(to the extent such item of Shared Collateral cannot be held in trust for multiple parties under applicable law), (vi) obtain the agreement
of a bailee or other third party to hold any item of Shared Collateral for the benefit of or subject to the control of or, in respect
of any item of Shared Collateral, to follow the instructions of or (vii) obtain the agreement of a landlord with respect to access to
leased premises where any item of Shared Collateral is located or waivers or subordination of rights with respect to any item of Shared
Collateral in favor of, in any case, the Senior Representative or Senior Secured Party and any Junior Representative or Junior Priority
Debt Party, such Grantor may, until the applicable Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, comply with such requirement under the
Junior Priority Collateral Document as it relates to such Shared Collateral by taking any of the actions set forth above only with respect
to, or in favor of, the Senior Representative.

Section
5.02          Insurance
and Condemnation Awards. Unless and until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, the Senior Representative and the
Senior Secured Parties shall have the sole and exclusive right, subject to the rights of the Grantors under the Senior Debt
Documents, (a) to be named as additional insured and loss payee under any insurance policies maintained from time to time by any
Grantor other persons, in addition to the Junior Representative, (b) to adjust settlement for any insurance policy covering the
Shared Collateral in the event of any loss thereunder and (c) to approve any award granted in any condemnation or similar proceeding
affecting the Shared Collateral. Unless and until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, all proceeds of any such policy
and any such award, if in respect of the Shared Collateral, shall be applied (i) first, prior to the occurrence of the Discharge of
Senior Obligations, to the Senior Representative for the benefit of Senior Secured Parties pursuant to the terms of the Senior Debt
Documents, (ii) second, after the occurrence of the Discharge of Senior Obligations, to the Designated Junior Representative for the
benefit of the Junior Priority Debt Parties pursuant to the terms of the applicable Junior Priority Debt Documents and (iii) third,
if no Junior Priority Debt Obligations or Senior Obligations are outstanding, to the owner of the subject property, such other
Person as may be entitled thereto or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. If any Junior Representative or any
Junior Priority Debt Party shall, at any time, receive any proceeds of any such insurance policy or any such award in contravention
of this Agreement, it shall pay such proceeds over to the Senior Representative in accordance with the terms of Section 4.02.
 
Section
5.03          Matters
Relating to Loan Documents.
 
(a)              
The Senior Debt Documents and the terms thereof may be amended, restated, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified (including
in connection with the incurrence of any incremental facilities) in accordance with their terms, and the Indebtedness under the Senior
Debt Documents may be Refinanced, in each case, without the consent of any Junior Priority Debt Parties; provided, however,
that, without the consent of the Designated Junior Representative, no such amendment, restatement, supplement, modification, waiver or
Refinancing (or successive amendments, restatements, supplements, modifications, waivers or Refinancings) shall contravene any provision
of this Agreement.
 
(b)              
Without the prior written consent of the Senior Representative, no Junior Priority Debt Document may be amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified, or entered into, to the extent such amendment, restatement, supplement or modification, or the terms
of such new Junior Priority Debt Document, would (i) contravene the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) unless expressly permitted by
the terms of each then extant Senior Debt Document, change any scheduled (other than mandatory prepayments) dates for payment of principal
on Indebtedness under the Junior Priority Debt Documents to a date on or prior to the Maturity Date (as defined in the First Lien Credit
Agreement as in effect on the date hereof).
 
Section
5.04          Amendments
to Junior Priority Collateral Documents.
 
(a)              
No Junior Priority Collateral Document may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified or entered into to the extent
such amendment, supplement or modification, or the terms of any new Junior Priority Collateral Document, would be prohibited by or inconsistent
with any of the terms of this Agreement. Each Junior Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Priority Debt Party under
its Junior Priority Debt Facility, agrees that each Junior Priority Collateral Document under its Junior Priority Debt Facility shall
include the following language (or language to similar effect reasonably approved by the Senior Representative):
 
 
“Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, (i) the liens and security interests granted to the Junior Representative pursuant to this Agreement are expressly
subject and subordinate to the liens and security interests granted in favor of the Senior Secured Parties (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement referred to below), including liens and security interests granted to (A) Citibank, N.A.,
(“Citi”), as collateral agent, pursuant to or in connection with that certain Credit Agreement dated as of
January 21, 2022 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time), among Nabors Industries Ltd.
(“Holdings”), Nabors Industries Inc. (the “Borrower”), Citi, as administrative agent (in such
capacity, and together with successors and assigns in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”) and as
collateral agent and the other parties thereto, as amended, restated, amended and restated, extended, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, and (ii) the exercise of any right or remedy by the Junior Representative hereunder is subject to the
limitations and provisions of the Junior Intercreditor Agreement dated as of [	], 20[_] (as amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, the “Intercreditor Agreement”), among Citi, as collateral agent, Holdings,
the Borrower, the other Grantors from time to time party thereto and [            		], as the Senior Representative and [  ],
as the Initial Junior Representative. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of
this Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall govern.”
 


13
 

 
(b)              
In the event that the Senior Representative and/or the Senior Secured Parties enter into any amendment, waiver or consent
in respect of any of the Senior Collateral Documents for the purpose of adding to or deleting from, or waiving or consenting to any departures
from any provisions of, any Senior Collateral Document or changing in any manner the rights of the Senior Representative, the Senior Secured
Parties, Holdings or any other Grantor thereunder (including the release of any Liens in Senior Collateral) in a manner that is applicable
to all Senior Facilities, then such amendment, waiver or consent shall apply automatically to any comparable provision of each comparable
Junior Priority Collateral Document without the consent of any Junior Representative or any Junior Priority Debt Party and without any
action by any Junior Representative, Holdings, any other Grantor; provided, however, that (A) no such amendment, waiver
or consent shall have the effect of (i) removing assets subject to the Lien of the Junior Priority Collateral Documents, except to the
extent that such release is permitted by Section 5.01 and there is a corresponding release of the Lien securing the Senior Obligations,
(ii) imposing duties that are adverse on any Junior Representative without its consent or (iii) altering the terms of the Junior Priority
Debt Documents to permit other Liens on the Collateral not permitted under the terms of the Junior Priority Debt Documents as in effect
on the date hereof or under Article VI hereof and (B) written notice of such amendment, waiver or consent shall have been given to each
Junior Representative within [10 Business Days] after the effectiveness of such amendment, waiver or consent, provided that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the effectiveness and validity thereof.
 
Section
5.05          Rights
as Unsecured Creditors. The Junior Representatives and the Junior Priority Debt Parties may exercise rights and remedies as
unsecured creditors against Holdings or the Guarantors in accordance with the terms of the Junior Priority Debt Documents and
applicable law so long as such rights and remedies do not violate any other provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement
shall prohibit the receipt by any Junior Representative or any Junior Priority Debt Party of the required payments of principal,
premium, interest, fees and other amounts due under the Junior Priority Debt Documents so long as such receipt is not the direct or
indirect result of the exercise by a Junior Representative or any Junior Priority Debt Party of rights or remedies as a secured
creditor in respect of Shared Collateral. In the event any Junior Representative or any Junior Priority Debt Party becomes a
judgment lien creditor in respect of Shared Collateral as a result of its enforcement of its rights as an unsecured creditor in
respect of Junior Priority Debt Obligations, such judgment lien shall be subordinated to the Liens securing Senior Obligations on
the same basis as the other Liens securing the Junior Priority Debt Obligations are so subordinated to such Liens securing Senior
Obligations under this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall impair or otherwise adversely affect any rights or remedies the
Senior Representative or the Senior Secured Parties may have with respect to the Senior Collateral.
 
Section
5.06          Gratuitous
Bailee for Perfection.
 
(a)              
The Senior Representative acknowledges and agrees that if it shall at any time hold a Lien securing the Senior Obligations
on any Shared Collateral that can be perfected by the possession or control of such Shared Collateral or of any account in which such
Shared Collateral is held, and if such Shared Collateral or any such account is in fact in the possession or under the control of such
Senior Representative, or of agents or bailees of such Person (such Shared Collateral being referred to herein as the “Pledged
or Controlled Collateral”), or if it shall at any time obtain any landlord waiver or bailee’s letter or any similar agreement
or arrangement granting it rights or access to Shared Collateral, the Senior Representative shall also hold such Pledged or Controlled
Collateral, or take such actions with respect to such landlord waiver, bailee’s letter or similar agreement or arrangement, as sub-agent
or gratuitous bailee for the relevant Junior Representatives (such bailment and agency being intended, among other things, to satisfy
the requirement of Sections 8-301(a)(2), 9-313(c), 9-104, 9-105, 9-106, and 9-107 of the UCC), in each case solely for the purpose of
perfecting the Liens granted under the relevant Junior Priority Collateral Documents and subject to the terms and conditions of this Section
5.06.
 
(b)              
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, the Senior Representative
and the Senior Secured Parties shall be entitled to deal with the Pledged or Controlled Collateral in accordance with the terms of the
Senior Debt Documents as if the Liens under the Junior Priority Collateral Documents did not exist. The rights of the Junior Representatives
and the Junior Priority Debt Parties with respect to the Pledged or Controlled Collateral shall at all times be subject to the terms of
this Agreement.
 


14
 

 
(c)              
The Senior Representative and the Senior Secured Parties shall have no obligation whatsoever to the Junior Representatives
or any Junior Priority Debt Party to assure that any of the Pledged or Controlled Collateral is genuine or owned by the Grantors or to
protect or preserve rights or benefits of any Person or any rights pertaining to the Shared Collateral, except as expressly set forth
in this Section 5.06. The duties or responsibilities of the Senior Representative under this Section 5.06 shall be limited solely to holding
or controlling the Shared Collateral and the related Liens referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 5.06 as sub-agent and
gratuitous bailee for the relevant Junior Representative for purposes of perfecting the Lien held by such Junior Representative and delivering
the Shared Collateral upon a Discharge of Senior Obligations as set forth in Section 5.06(f).
 
(d)              
The Senior Representative shall not have by reason of the Junior Priority Collateral Documents or this Agreement, or any
other document, a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Junior Representative or any Junior Priority Debt Party, and each Junior Representative,
for itself and on behalf of each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, hereby waives and releases the Senior
Representative from all claims and liabilities arising pursuant to the Senior Representative’ roles under this Section 5.06 as sub-agents
and gratuitous bailees with respect to the Shared Collateral.
 
(e)              
 Upon the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Senior Representative shall, at the Grantors’ sole cost and expense,
(i) (A) deliver to the Designated Junior Representative, to the extent that it is legally permitted to do so, all Shared Collateral, including
all proceeds thereof, held or controlled by the Senior Representative or any of its agents or bailees, including the transfer of possession
and control, as applicable, of the Pledged or Controlled Collateral, together with any necessary endorsements and notices to depositary
banks, securities intermediaries and commodities intermediaries, and to the extent that it is able to do so assign its rights under any
landlord waiver or bailee’s letter or any similar agreement or arrangement granting it rights or access to Shared Collateral, or
(B) direct and deliver such Shared Collateral as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct, (ii) notify any applicable insurance
carrier that it is no longer entitled to be a loss payee or additional insured under the insurance policies of any Grantor issued by such
insurance carrier and (iii) notify any governmental authority involved in any condemnation or similar proceeding involving any Grantor
that the Designated Junior Representative is entitled to approve any awards granted in such proceeding. Holdings and the other Grantors
shall take such further action as is required to effectuate the transfer contemplated hereby and shall indemnify the Senior Representative
for loss or damage suffered by such Senior Representative as a result of such transfer, except for loss or damage suffered by any such
Person as a result of its own willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith or the willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith
of a Representative (as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). The Senior Representative
have no obligations to follow instructions from any Junior Representative or any other Junior Priority Debt Party in contravention of
this Agreement.
 
(f)               
None of the Senior Representative nor any of the other Senior Secured Parties shall be required to marshal any present or
future collateral security for any obligations of Holdings or any Subsidiary to the Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Party
under the Senior Debt Documents or any assurance of payment in respect thereof, or to resort to such collateral security or other assurances
of payment in any particular order, and all of their rights in respect of such collateral security or any assurance of payment in respect
thereof shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights, however existing or arising.
 


15
 

 
Section
5.07          When
Discharge of Senior Obligations is Deemed Not to Have Occurred. If, at any time substantially concurrently with or after the
Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, Holdings or any other Subsidiary Guarantor incurs the Senior Obligations (other than
in respect of the payment of indemnities surviving the Discharge of Senior Obligations), then such Discharge of Senior Obligations
shall automatically be deemed not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement (other than with respect to any actions taken
prior to the date of such designation as a result of the occurrence of such first Discharge of Senior Obligations) and the
applicable agreement governing such Senior Obligations shall automatically be treated as a Senior Debt Document for all purposes of
this Agreement, including for purposes of the Lien priorities and rights in respect of Shared Collateral set forth herein and the
agent, representative or trustee for the holders of such Senior Obligations shall be a Senior Representative for all purposes of
this Agreement. Upon receipt of notice of such incurrence (including the identity of the new Senior Representative), each Junior
Representative (including the Designated Junior Representative) shall promptly (a) enter into such documents and agreements (at the
expense of the Borrower), including amendments or supplements to this Agreement, as the Borrower or such new Senior Representative
shall reasonably request in writing in order to provide the new Senior Representative the rights of a Senior Representative
contemplated hereby, (b) deliver to such Senior Representative, to the extent that it is legally permitted to do so, all Shared
Collateral, including all proceeds thereof, held or controlled by such Junior Representative or any of its agents or bailees,
including the transfer of possession and control, as applicable, of the Pledged or Controlled Collateral, together with any
necessary endorsements and notices to depositary banks, securities intermediaries and commodities intermediaries, and assign its
rights under any landlord waiver or bailee’s letter or any similar agreement or arrangement granting it rights or access to
Shared Collateral, and (c) notify any governmental authority involved in any condemnation or similar proceeding involving a Grantor
that the new Senior Representative is entitled to approve any awards granted in such proceeding.
 
Article
VI

Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings
 
Section
6.01          Financing
Issues. Until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, if Holdings or any other Grantor shall be subject to any
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding the Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Party shall desire to consent (or not object)
to the sale, use or lease of cash or other collateral or to consent (or not object) to Holdings’ or any other Grantor’s
obtaining financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, from any Senior Secured Party) under Section 363 or Section 364 of the
Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law (“DIP Financing”), then each Junior
Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, agrees that it
will raise no objection to and will not otherwise contest such sale, use or lease of such cash or other collateral or such DIP
Financing and, except to the extent permitted by Section 3.01(a) and Section 6.03, will not request adequate protection or any other
relief in connection therewith and, to the extent the Liens securing the Senior Obligations are subordinated to or pari passu with
such DIP Financing, will subordinate (and will be deemed hereunder to have subordinated) its Liens in the Shared Collateral to (x)
such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the Liens securing the Junior Priority Debt
Obligations are so subordinated to the Liens securing the Senior Obligations under this Agreement, (y) all adequate protection Liens
granted to the Senior Secured Parties, and (z) to any “carve-out” for professional and United States Trustee fees or
payment of any other amounts agreed to by applicable Senior Secured Parties. Each Junior Representative, for itself and on behalf of
each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, further agrees that until the Discharge of Senior
Obligations has occurred, it will raise no (a) objection to (and will not otherwise contest) any motion for relief from the
automatic stay or from any injunction against foreclosure or enforcement in respect of Senior Obligations made by the Senior
Representative, (b) objection to (and will not otherwise contest) any lawful exercise by any Senior Secured Party of the right to
credit bid Senior Obligations at any sale in foreclosure of Senior Collateral (including pursuant to Section 363(k) of the
Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable law), (c) objection to (and will not
otherwise contest) any other request for judicial relief made in any court by any Senior Secured Party relating to the lawful
enforcement of any Lien on Senior Collateral or (d) objection to (and will not otherwise contest or oppose) any order relating to a
sale or other disposition of assets of any Grantor (including under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of
any other Bankruptcy Law) for which the Senior Representative has consented (or not objected) that provides, to the extent such sale
or other disposition is to be free and clear of Liens, that the Liens securing the Senior Obligations and the Junior Priority Debt
Obligations will attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the
Senior Obligations rank to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the Junior Priority Debt Obligations pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.01 shall prohibit any Junior Priority Debt Party from (a)
subject to Section 6.05(b), exercising its rights to vote in favor of or against a plan of reorganization, (b) proposing a DIP
Financing to any Grantor or (c) objecting to any provision in any DIP Financing relating, describing or requiring any provision or
content of a plan of reorganization.
 


16
 

 
Section
6.02          Relief
from the Automatic Stay. Until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, each Junior Representative, for itself and on behalf
of each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, agrees that none of them shall seek relief from the automatic
stay or any other stay in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or take any action in derogation thereof, or support or join, directly
or indirectly, any party in doing or performing the same, in each case in respect of any Shared Collateral, without the prior written
consent of the Senior Representative.
 
Section
6.03          Adequate
Protection. Each Junior Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority
Debt Facility, agrees that none of them shall (x) object, contest or support any other Person objecting to or contesting (a) any
request by the Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Parties for adequate protection in any form, (b) any objection by the
Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Parties to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on any claims by a Senior
Representative or Senior Secured Party of a lack of adequate protection or (c) the allowance and/or payment of interest, fees,
expenses or other amounts of the Senior Representative or any other Senior Secured Party under Section 506(b) or 506(c) of the
Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law or (y) request any form of adequate protection except as
permitted by the following sentence. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.03 or in Section 6.01, in any Insolvency
or Liquidation Proceeding, (i) if the Senior Secured Parties (or any subset thereof) are granted adequate protection in the form of
a Lien on additional or replacement collateral in connection with any DIP Financing or use of cash collateral under Section 363 or
364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law and/or a superpriority administrative claim, then
each Junior Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, may
seek or request, without objection by any Senior Secured Party, adequate protection in the form of (as applicable) a Lien on such
additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative claim, which Lien is subordinated to the Liens securing
and granted as adequate protection for all Senior Obligations and such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) on the
same basis as the other Liens securing the Junior Priority Debt Obligations are so subordinated to the Liens securing Senior
Obligations under this Agreement and which superpriority claim is junior and subordinated to the superpriority administrative claim
granted as adequate protection to the Senior Secured Parties; provided, that each Junior Priority Debt Representative shall
have irrevocably agreed, pursuant to Section 1129(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code, on behalf of itself and on behalf of each Junior
Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, in any stipulation and/or order granting such adequate protection, that
such junior superpriority claims may be paid under any plan of reorganization in any combination of cash, debt, equity or other
property having a value on the effective date of such plan equal to the allowed amount of such junior superpriority claims, and (ii)
in the event any Junior Representatives, for themselves and on behalf of the Junior Priority Debt Parties under their Junior
Priority Debt Facilities, seek or request adequate protection and such adequate protection is granted in the form of a Lien on
additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative claim, then such Junior Representatives, for themselves
and on behalf of each Junior Priority Debt Party under their Junior Priority Debt Facilities, agree that the Senior Representative
shall also be entitled to seek without objection from any Junior Priority Debt Party, a senior Lien on such additional or
replacement collateral as adequate protection for the Senior Obligations and/or a superpriority administrative claim, and that any
Lien on such additional or replacement collateral granted as adequate protection for the Junior Priority Debt Obligations shall be
subordinated to the Liens on such collateral securing the Senior Obligations and any such DIP Financing (and all obligations
relating thereto) and any other Liens granted to the Senior Secured Parties as adequate protection on the same basis as the other
Liens securing the Junior Priority Debt Obligations are so subordinated to such Liens securing Senior Obligations under this
Agreement, and that any superpriority claim is junior and subordinated to the superpriority administrative claim granted as adequate
protection to the Senior Secured Parties, and to the extent the Senior Secured Parties are not granted such adequate protection in
such form, any amounts recovered by or distributed to any Junior Priority Debt Party pursuant to or as a result of any Lien on such
additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative claim so granted to the Junior Priority Debt Parties
shall be subject to Section 4.02.
 


17
 

 
Section
6.04          Preference
Issues. If any Senior Secured Party is required in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or otherwise to disgorge, turn over or
otherwise pay any amount to the estate of either Holdings or any other Grantor (or any trustee, receiver or similar Person therefor),
because the payment of such amount was declared to be or avoided as fraudulent or preferential or otherwise under Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy
Code or otherwise, in any respect or for any other reason, any amount (a “Recovery”), whether received as proceeds
of security, enforcement of any right of setoff, recoupment, or otherwise, then the Senior Obligations shall be reinstated to the extent
of such Recovery and deemed to be outstanding as if such payment had not occurred and the Senior Secured Parties shall be entitled to
the benefits of this Agreement until a Discharge of Senior Obligations with respect to all such recovered amounts. If this Agreement shall
have been terminated prior to such Recovery, this Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall
not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties hereto. Each Junior Representative, for itself
and on behalf of each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, hereby agrees that none of them shall be entitled
to benefit from any avoidance action affecting or otherwise relating to any distribution or allocation made in accordance with this Agreement,
whether by preference or otherwise, it being understood and agreed that the benefit of such avoidance action otherwise allocable to them
shall instead be allocated and turned over for application in accordance with the priorities set forth in this Agreement the Senior Debt
Documents and/or Collateral Documents, as applicable.
 
Section
6.05          Separate
Grants of Security and Separate Classifications; Plans of Reorganization.Each Junior Representative, for itself and on behalf of
each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, acknowledges and agrees that (a) the grants of Liens
pursuant to the Senior Collateral Documents and the Junior Priority Collateral Documents constitute separate and distinct grants of
Liens and (b) because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Shared Collateral, the Junior Priority Debt Obligations
are fundamentally different from the Senior Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar
dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed or adopted in an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. To further effectuate the
intent of the parties as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that any claims of the Senior Secured Parties
and the Junior Priority Debt Parties in respect of the Shared Collateral constitute a single class of claims (rather than separate
classes of senior and junior secured claims), then each Junior Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Priority Debt
Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, hereby acknowledges and agrees that all distributions shall be made as if there were
separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Grantors in respect of the Shared Collateral (with the effect being
that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Shared Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by
the Junior Priority Debt Parties), the Senior Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to
them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees,
and expenses (whether or not allowed or allowable) before any distribution is made from the Shared Collateral in respect of the
Junior Priority Debt Obligations, with each Junior Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Priority Debt Party under
its Junior Priority Debt Facility, hereby acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Senior Representative amounts otherwise
received or receivable by them from the Shared Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if
such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Junior Priority Debt Parties.
 
(a)              
Each Junior Priority Debt Party (whether in the capacity of a secured creditor or an unsecured creditor in accordance with
Section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law) shall not propose, vote in favor of, or otherwise
directly or indirectly support any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with the terms
of this Agreement unless such plan is proposed or supported by the number of Senior Secured Parties required under Section 1126(c) of
the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision or any other Bankruptcy Law.
 
Section
6.06          No
Waivers of Rights of Senior Secured Parties. Nothing contained herein shall, except as expressly provided herein, prohibit or in any
way limit the Senior Representative or any other Senior Secured Party from objecting in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or otherwise
to any action taken by any Junior Priority Debt Party, including the seeking by any Junior Priority Debt Party of adequate protection
or the asserting by any Junior Priority Debt Party of any of its rights and remedies under the Junior Priority Debt Documents or otherwise.

This Agreement, which the parties hereto expressly acknowledge is a “subordination agreement” under Section 510(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law, shall be effective and enforceable before, during and after the
commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. The relative rights as to the Shared Collateral and Proceeds thereof shall continue
after the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding on the same basis as prior to the date of the petition therefor, subject
to any court order approving the financing of, or use of cash collateral by, any Grantor. All references herein to any Grantor shall include
such Grantor as a debtor-in-possession and any receiver or trustee for such Grantor.
 
Section
6.08         
Other Matters. To the extent that any Junior Representative or any Junior Priority Debt Party has or acquires rights
under Section 363 or Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law with respect to any of the
Shared Collateral, such Junior Representative, on behalf of itself and each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt
Facility, agrees not to assert any such rights without the prior written consent of the Senior Representative, provided that if
requested by the Senior Representative, such Junior Representative shall timely exercise such rights in the manner requested by such
Senior Representative, including any rights to payments in respect of such rights.
 
Section
6.09          506(c)
Claims. Until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, each Junior Representative, on behalf of itself and each Junior Priority
Debt Party, agrees that it will not assert, support or enforce any claim under Section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision
of any other Bankruptcy Law or seek to recover any amounts that any Grantor may obtain by virtue of any claim under Section 506(c) of
the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law, in each case, for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing
of any Shared Collateral or otherwise, and it will not accept the benefit of any such claims. Until the Discharge of Senior Obligations
has occurred, to the extent any Junior Priority Debt Party receives any payments or consideration on account of or resulting from claims
under 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law in violation of the immediately-preceding sentence,
then such Junior Priority Debt Party will turn over to the Senior Representative such amounts, even if such turnover has the effect of
reducing the claim or recovery of the Junior Priority Debt Parties.
 
Section
6.10          Reorganization
Securities. If, in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, debt obligations of the reorganized debtor secured by Liens upon any
property of the reorganized debtor are distributed, pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, on
account of both the Senior Obligations and the Junior Priority Debt Obligations, then, to the extent the debt obligations distributed
on account of the Senior Obligations and on account of the Junior Priority Debt Obligations are secured by Liens upon the same assets
or property, the provisions of this Agreement will survive the distribution of such debt obligations pursuant to such plan and will apply
with like effect to the Liens securing such debt obligations.
 
Section
6.11          Section
1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. Until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, none of the Junior Representatives nor any
Junior Priority Debt Party shall seek to exercise any rights under Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision under
any Bankruptcy Law. All rights of the Senior Secured Parties to exercise any rights under Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any
similar provision under any Bankruptcy Law, if any, are reserved and unaltered by this Agreement.

Reliance; etc.
 
Section
7.01          Reliance.
The consent by the Senior Secured Parties to the execution and delivery of the Junior Priority Debt Documents to which the Senior
Secured Parties have consented and all loans and other extensions of credit made or deemed made on and after the effective date of
this Agreement by the Senior Secured Parties to the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall be deemed to have been given and made in
reliance upon this Agreement. Each Junior Representative, on behalf of itself and each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior
Priority Debt Facility, acknowledges that it and such Junior Priority Debt Parties have, independently and without reliance on the
Senior Representative or other Senior Secured Party, and based on documents and information deemed by them appropriate, made their
own credit analysis and decision to enter into the Junior Priority Debt Documents to which they are party or by which they are
bound, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and they will continue to make their own credit decision
in taking or not taking any action under the Junior Priority Debt Documents or this Agreement.
 
Section
7.02          No
Warranties or Liability. Each Junior Representative, on behalf of itself and each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority
Debt Facility, acknowledges and agrees that neither the Senior Representative nor any other Senior Secured Party has made any express
or implied representation or warranty, including with respect to the execution, validity, legality, completeness, collectability or enforceability
of any of the Senior Debt Documents, the ownership of any Shared Collateral or the perfection or priority of any Liens thereon. The Senior
Secured Parties will be entitled to manage and supervise their respective loans and extensions of credit under the Senior Debt Documents
in accordance with law and as they may otherwise, in their sole discretion, deem appropriate, and the Senior Secured Parties may manage
their loans and extensions of credit without regard to any rights or interests that the Junior Representatives and the Junior Priority
Debt Parties have in the Shared Collateral or otherwise, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. Neither the Senior Representative
nor any other Senior Secured Party shall have any duty to any Junior Representative or Junior Priority Debt Party to act or refrain from
acting in a manner that allows, or results in, the occurrence or continuance of an event of default or default under any agreement with
Holdings or any Subsidiary (including the Junior Priority Debt Documents), regardless of any knowledge thereof that they may have or be
charged with. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Senior Representative, the Senior Secured Parties, the Junior Representatives
and the Junior Priority Debt Parties have not otherwise made to each other, nor do they hereby make to each other, any warranties, express
or implied, nor do they assume any liability to each other with respect to (a) the enforceability, validity, value or collectability of
any of the Senior Obligations, the Junior Priority Debt Obligations or any guarantee or security which may have been granted to any of
them in connection therewith, (b) any Grantor’s title to or right to transfer any of the Shared Collateral or (c) any other matter
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
 
Section
7.03          Obligations
Unconditional. All rights, interests, agreements and obligations of the Senior Representative, the Senior Secured Parties, the Junior
Representatives and the Junior Priority Debt Parties hereunder shall remain in full force and effect irrespective of:
 
(a)              
any lack of validity or enforceability of any Senior Debt Document or any Junior Priority Debt Document;
 
(b)               any
change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other terms of, all or any of the Senior Obligations or Junior Priority
Debt Obligations, or any amendment or waiver or other modification, including any increase in the amount thereof, whether by course
of conduct or otherwise, of the terms of the Senior Debt Document or of the terms of any Junior Priority Debt Document;
 


20
 

 
(c)              
any exchange of any security interest in any Shared Collateral or any other collateral or any amendment, waiver or other
modification, whether in writing or by course of conduct or otherwise, of all or any of the Senior Obligations or Junior Priority Debt
Obligations or any guarantee thereof;
 
(d)              
the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding in respect of Holdings or any other Grantor; or
 
(e)              
any other circumstances that otherwise might constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, (i) Holdings or any other
Grantor in respect of the Senior Obligations or (ii) any Junior Representative or Junior Priority Debt Party in respect of this Agreement.

Miscellaneous
 
Section
8.01          Conflicts.
 
(a)              
Subject to Section 8.22, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of any
Senior Debt Document or any Junior Priority Debt Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.
 
Section
8.02          Continuing
Nature of this Agreement; Severability. Subject to Section 5.07 and Section 6.04, this Agreement shall continue to be effective until
the Discharge of Senior Obligations shall have occurred. This is a continuing agreement of Lien subordination, and the Senior Secured
Parties may continue, at any time and without notice to the Junior Representatives or any Junior Priority Debt Party, to extend credit
and other financial accommodations and lend monies to or for the benefit of Holdings or any Subsidiary constituting Senior Obligations
in reliance hereon. The terms of this Agreement shall survive and continue in full force and effect in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.
Any provision of this Agreement that is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any
other jurisdiction. The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions
with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.
 
Section
8.03          Amendments;
Waivers.
 
(a)               No
failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a
right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies
of the parties hereto are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same
shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on any party hereto in any case shall entitle such party to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
 


21
 

 
(b)              
Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be amended or modified or any provision waived except pursuant to an
instrument in writing signed by each Representative (in each case, acting in accordance with the documents governing the applicable Debt
Facility), Holdings and the Borrower (or any successor Borrowers under the First Lien Credit Agreement); provided that (x) the
Senior Representative may, without the written consent of any other Secured Party, agree to modifications of this Agreement solely for
the purpose of securing additional extensions of credit (including pursuant to the First Lien Credit Agreement or any Refinancing or extension
thereof) and adding new creditors as “Secured Parties” and “Senior Secured Parties” hereunder, so long as such
extensions (and resulting additions) do not otherwise give rise to a violation of the express terms of the First Lien Credit Agreement
or any other Senior Debt Documents or the Junior Priority Debt Document and (y) additional Grantors may be added as parties hereto in
accordance with the provisions of Section 8.07. Any such amendment, supplement or waiver shall be in writing and shall be binding upon
the Senior Secured Parties and the Junior Priority Debt Parties and their respective successors and assigns. Each waiver of the terms
of this Agreement, if any, shall be a waiver only with respect to the specific instance involved and shall not impair the rights of the
parties making such waiver or the obligations of the other parties to such party in any other respect or at any other time.
 
(c)              
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Secured Party, any Representative may become a party hereto by
execution and delivery of a Representatives Supplement in accordance with Section 8.08 of this Agreement and upon such execution and delivery,
such Representative and the Secured Parties and Senior Obligations or Junior Priority Debt Obligations of the Debt Facility for which
such Representative is acting shall be subject to the terms hereof.
 
Section
8.04          Information
Concerning the Financial Condition of Holdings, the Borrower and the Subsidiaries. The Senior Representative, the Senior Secured
Parties, the Junior Representatives and the Junior Priority Debt Parties shall each be responsible for keeping themselves informed
of (a) the financial condition of Holdings, the Borrower and the Subsidiaries and all endorsers or guarantors of the Senior
Obligations or the Junior Priority Debt Obligations and (b) all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the
Senior Obligations or the Junior Priority Debt Obligations. The Senior Representative, the Senior Secured Parties, the Junior
Representatives and the Junior Priority Debt Parties shall have no duty to advise any other party hereunder of information known to
it or them regarding such condition or any such circumstances or otherwise. In the event that the Senior Representative, any Senior
Secured Party, any Junior Representative or any Junior Priority Debt Party, in its sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from
time to time to provide any such information to any other party, it shall be under no obligation to (i) make, and the Senior
Representative, the Senior Secured Parties, the Junior Representatives and the Junior Priority Debt Parties shall not make or be
deemed to have made, any express or implied representation or warranty, including with respect to the accuracy, completeness,
truthfulness or validity of any such information so provided, (ii) provide any additional information or to provide any such
information on any subsequent occasion, (iii) undertake any investigation or (iv) disclose any information that, pursuant to
accepted or reasonable commercial finance practices, such party wishes to maintain confidential or is otherwise required to maintain
confidential.

Section
8.05          Subrogation.
Subject to the Discharge of Senior Obligations, with respect to the value of any payments or distributions in cash, or other assets that
the Junior Priority Debt Parties or any Junior Representative pays over to the Senior Representative or any of the other Senior Secured
Parties under the terms of this Agreement, the Junior Priority Debt Parties and each Junior Representative shall be subrogated to the
rights of the Senior Representative and such other Senior Secured Parties; provided that each Junior Representative, on behalf
of itself and each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, hereby agrees not to assert any rights of subrogation
it may acquire as a result of any payment hereunder until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred. Each Grantor acknowledges
and agrees that the value of any payments or distributions in cash or other assets received by any Junior Representative or the other
Junior Priority Debt Party and paid over to the Senior Representative or the other Senior Secured Parties pursuant to, and applied in
accordance with, this Agreement, shall not relieve or reduce any of the Obligations owed by any Grantor under the Junior Priority Debt
Documents.
 
Section
8.06          Application
of Payments. Except as otherwise provided herein, all payments received by the Senior Secured Parties may be applied, reversed and
reapplied, in whole or in part, to such part of the Senior Obligations as the Senior Secured Parties, in their sole discretion, deem appropriate,
consistent with the terms of the Senior Debt Documents. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Junior Representative, on behalf of
itself and each Junior Priority Debt Party under its Junior Priority Debt Facility, assents to any such extension or postponement of the
time of payment of the Senior Obligations or any part thereof and to any other indulgence with respect thereto, to any substitution, exchange
or release of any security that may at any time secure any part of the Senior Obligations and to the addition or release of any other
Person primarily or secondarily liable therefor.
 
Section
8.07          Additional
Grantors. Holdings and the Borrower agree that, if any Subsidiary shall become a Grantor after the date hereof, it will promptly cause
such Subsidiary to become party hereto by executing and delivering an instrument in the form of Annex I. Upon such execution and
delivery, such Subsidiary will become a Grantor hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Grantor herein. The
execution and delivery of such instrument shall not require the consent of any other party hereunder, and will be acknowledged by the
Designated Junior Representative and the Senior Representative. The rights and obligations of each Grantor hereunder shall remain in full
force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Grantor as a party to this Agreement.
 


23
 

 
Section
8.08          Additional
Debt Facilities. To the extent, but only to the extent, permitted by the provisions of the then extant Senior Debt Documents and
the Junior Priority Debt Documents and this Agreement, the Borrower may incur or issue and sell one or more series or classes of
Junior Priority Debt. Any such additional class or series of Junior Priority Debt (the “Junior Priority Class
Debt”) may be secured by a junior priority, subordinated Lien on Shared Collateral, in each case under and pursuant to the
relevant Junior Priority Collateral Documents for such Junior Priority Class Debt, if and subject to the condition that the
Representative of any such Junior Priority Class Debt (each, a “Junior Priority Class Debt Representative”),
acting on behalf of the holders of such Junior Priority Class Debt (such Representative and holders in respect of any Junior
Priority Class Debt being referred to as the “Junior Priority Class Debt Parties”), becomes a party to this
Agreement by satisfying conditions (i) through (iii), as applicable, in this Section 8.08. In order for a Junior Priority Class Debt
Representative to become a party to this Agreement:
 
(i)                
such Junior Priority Class Debt Representative shall have executed and delivered a Representatives Supplement substantially
in the form of Annex II (with such changes as may be reasonably approved by the Senior Representative and such Junior Priority Class Debt
Representative) pursuant to which it becomes a Representative hereunder, and the Junior Priority Class Debt in respect of which such Junior
Priority Class Debt Representative is the Representative and the related Junior Priority Class Debt Parties become subject hereto and
bound hereby;
 
(ii)             
the Borrower shall have delivered to the Senior Representative and Designated Junior Representative a certificate of an
appropriate officer of each Borrower (an “Officer’s Certificate”) stating that the conditions set forth in this
Section 8.08 are satisfied with respect to such Junior Priority Class Debt and, if requested, true and complete copies of each of the
Junior Priority Debt Documents relating to such Junior Priority Class Debt, certified as being true and correct by a Responsible Officer
of each Borrower; and
 
(iii)           
the Junior Priority Debt Documents relating to such Junior Priority Class Debt shall provide that each Junior Priority Class
Debt Party with respect to such Junior Priority Class Debt will be subject to and bound by the provisions of this Agreement in its capacity
as a holder of such Junior Priority Class Debt.

in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof,

of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action

parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement and/or the Collateral Documents shall affect
any right that any Representative may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to any Senior Debt Document against any
Guarantor or its respective properties in the courts of any jurisdiction;
 


24
 

 
(b)              
 waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to

by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court;
 
(c)              
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 8.09 and nothing in this Agreement will affect
the right of any other party hereto (or any Secured Party) to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law;
 
(d)              
as it relates to any Grantor, such Grantor designates, appoints and empowers Holdings as its designee, appointee and agent

notices and documents that may be served in any such action or proceeding and Holdings hereby accepts such designation and appointment;
and
 
(e)              
waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have against another party hereto or any other Representative
or Secured Party to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred to in this Section 8.09 any special, exemplary, punitive
or consequential damages; provided that the foregoing waiver shall not apply to claims or recoveries resulting from a third party’s

owing to the First Lien Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 10.03 of the First Lien Credit Agreement.
