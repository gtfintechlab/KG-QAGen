Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made, then the Total Leverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma
effect to such incurrence or repayment of Indebtedness, to the extent required, as if the same had occurred on (A) the last day of the applicable Test Period in the case of the Total Leverage Ratio and the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio and
(B) the first day of the applicable Test Period in the case of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as
if the rate in effect on the date of the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any hedging obligations applicable to such Indebtedness);
provided that, in the case of repayment of any Indebtedness, to the extent actual interest related thereto was included during all or any portion of the applicable Test Period, the actual interest may be used for the applicable portion of
such Test Period. Interest on a Capital Lease shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Borrower to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capital Lease in
accordance with GAAP. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a London interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate
actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Borrower may designate. 
  59 




(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless the Borrower otherwise notifies
the Administrative Agent, with respect to any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of this Agreement that does not require compliance with a financial ratio or test (any such amounts, the
Fixed Amounts) substantially concurrently with any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of this Agreement that requires compliance with a financial ratio or test (any such
amounts, the Incurrence-Based Amounts), it is understood and agreed that the Fixed Amounts shall be disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to the Incurrence-Based Amounts in connection with such
substantially concurrent incurrence; provided that this subsection (d) shall apply solely with respect to the incurrence of Indebtedness pursuant to Section 9.03 and shall not apply to any transactions
entered into (or consummated) in reliance on any provision of Article IX (other than Section 9.03). 
1.09 Limited Condition Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Loan Document to the contrary, when determining
compliance with any applicable conditions to the consummation of any Limited Condition Transaction (including, without limitation, any Default or Event of Default condition), the date of determination of such applicable conditions shall, at the
option of the Borrower (the Borrowers election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction, an LCT Election), be deemed to be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition
Transaction are entered into (the LCT Test Date). If on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) such applicable conditions are calculated as if such Limited Condition Transaction and other related transactions had occurred at the beginning of the most recent Test Period ending prior to the LCT Test
Date for which financial statements are available to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower or Restricted Subsidiary could have taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with the applicable conditions thereto, such applicable
conditions shall be deemed to have been complied with, unless an Event of Default pursuant to Section 10.01(a), (f) or (g) shall be continuing on the date such Limited Condition Transaction is actually
consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, if an LCT Election is made, the applicable conditions thereto shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction. If the Borrower has made an LCT Election for any Limited
Condition Transaction, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio or basket availability with respect to any other Specified Transaction on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which
such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio or basket shall be
calculated both (x) on a Pro Forma Basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other related transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated and
(y) on a Pro Forma Basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other related transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have not been consummated, and the applicable
action shall only be permitted if there is sufficient availability under the applicable ratio or basket under both of the calculations pursuant to subsection (x) and (y).

ARTICLE II 
THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS 
2.01 Revolving Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Revolving Lender severally agrees to make Revolving
Loans to the Borrower from time to time, on any Business Day during the Availability Period, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such Lenders Revolving Commitment; provided, however, that
the aggregate amount of any Borrowing of Revolving Loans on the Closing Date may not exceed $175,000,000; provided, further, that after giving effect to any Borrowing of Revolving Loans, (i) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall
not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of any Revolving Lender, plus such Revolving Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations,
plus such Revolving Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all Swingline Loans shall not exceed such Lenders Revolving Commitment. Within the limits of each Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment, and subject to
the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.01. Revolving Loans
may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein.  2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of
Revolving Loans.  (a) Each Revolving Borrowing, each conversion of Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made upon the Borrowers irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by (A) telephone, or (B) a Revolving Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed
immediately by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Revolving Loan Notice. Each such Revolving Loan Notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date of
any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Revolving Loans, and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Revolving Loans; provided,
however, that if the Borrower wishes to request Eurodollar Rate Loans having an Interest Period other than one, two, three or six months in duration as provided in the definition of Interest Period, the applicable notice must be
received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. four (4) Business Days prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the applicable
Lenders of such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is acceptable to all of them. Not later than 11:00 a.m., three (3) Business Days before the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation, the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower (which notice may be by telephone) whether or not the requested Interest Period has been consented to by all the applicable Lenders. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c) and 2.04(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Revolving Loans
shall be in a principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Revolving Loan Notice shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Revolving Borrowing, a conversion of Revolving Loans from one Type
to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Revolving Loans to be borrowed,
converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Revolving Loans to be 
  61 





borrowed or to which existing Revolving Loans are to be converted, (v) the Facility pursuant to which the Borrowing is being requested, and (vi) if applicable, the duration of the
Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Revolving Loan in a Revolving Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Revolving Loans
shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower
requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Revolving Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month. 
(b) Following receipt of a Revolving Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender that holds a Commitment (or, in
the case of any Facility after the making of the applicable Revolving Loans, each Lender that holds any such Revolving Loans) under the applicable Facility of the amount of its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Revolving Loans, and if no timely
notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each applicable Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a
Revolving Borrowing, each Lender that holds a Commitment under the applicable Facility shall make the amount of its Revolving Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agents Office not
later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Revolving Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is a part of the initial Credit
Extensions on the Closing Date, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the
account of the Borrower on the books of Citizens Bank with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the
Borrower; provided, however, that if, on the date the Revolving Loan Notice with respect to such Borrowing is given by the Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing, first, shall be
applied to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be made available to the Borrower as provided above. 
(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for
such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Revolving Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders. 
(d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders funding such Loans of the interest rate applicable to any
Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans are
outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders holding such Loans of any change in the Base Rate promptly following such change. 
(e) After giving effect to all Revolving Borrowings, all conversions of Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of
Revolving Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten (10) Interest Periods in effect with respect to Revolving Loans. 
  62 




(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Lender may exchange,
continue or rollover all or a portion of its Loans in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Lender.  2.03 Letters of Credit. 
(a) The Letter of Credit Commitment. 
(i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of
the other Revolving Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the
account of the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries, and to amend or extend Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with subsection (b) below, and (2) to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit; and (B) the
Revolving Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries and any drawings thereunder; provided that after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with
respect to any Letter of Credit, (x) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of any Revolving Lender, plus such Revolving
Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Revolving Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all Swingline Loans shall not exceed such Revolving Lenders Commitment, and
(z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Each request by the Borrower for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by the Borrower that the
L/C Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers ability to obtain Letters of Credit
shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. All Existing Letters of Credit shall be
deemed to have been issued pursuant hereto, and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and governed by the terms and conditions hereof. 
(ii) The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit, if: 
(A) Subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur
more than twelve months after the date of issuance or last extension, unless the Required Lenders have approved such expiry date; or 
  63 




(B) The expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur after
the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless (x) all of the Revolving Lenders and the L/C Issuer have approved such expiry date or (y) such Letter of Credit is Cash Collateralized on terms and pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the
applicable L/C Issuer; provided that in the case of any such Letter of Credit that is so Cash Collateralized, the obligations of the Revolving Lenders to participate in such Letter of Credit pursuant to this
Section 2.03 shall terminate upon the Letter of Credit Expiration Date.  (iii) The L/C Issuer
shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:  (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with
respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or
expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;  (B) the
issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate any Laws or one or more policies of the L/C Issuer;  (C) except as
otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, such Letter of Credit is in an initial face amount less than $25,000; 
(D) such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars; 
(E) such Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing
thereunder; or  (F) any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements,
including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with the Borrower or such Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuers actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to
Section 2.17(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to which the L/C Issuer has actual or
potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion.  (iv) The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of
Credit if the L/C Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof. 
(v) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no
obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit. 
  64 




(vi) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any
Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Sections 11.03, 11.04 and
11.05 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term
Administrative Agent as used in such Sections included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer. 
(b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit. 
(i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C
Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application may be sent by facsimile, by United States
mail, by overnight courier, by electronic transmission using the system provided by the L/C Issuer, by personal delivery or by any other means acceptable to the L/C Issuer. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and the
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two (2) Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed
issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed
issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such
beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request
for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof
(which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require. Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents
and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may require. 
  65 




(ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the L/C
Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent
with a copy thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Revolving Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable
Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of
Credit for the account of the Borrower (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuers usual and customary business practices. Immediately
upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product
of such Revolving Lenders Pro Rata Share of all Revolving Credit Facilities times the amount of such Letter of Credit. 
(iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent
any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the
Non-Extension Notice Date) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not
be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the
extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined
that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of subsection (ii) or (iii) of
Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven (7) Business Days before the
Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Lender or any Loan
Party that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension. 
(iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with
respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
  66 




(c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations. 
(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C
Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an Honor Date) to the extent the Borrower
receives notice of draw prior to 12:00 p.m. on the Honor Date, and not later than 11:00 a.m. on the Business Day following the Honor Date otherwise, the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to
the amount of such drawing. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed
Amount), and the amount of such Revolving Lenders Pro Rata Share thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans under the Revolving Commitment to be disbursed on the
Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized
portion of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Revolving Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to
this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.
 (ii) Each Revolving Lender (including the Lender acting as L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agents Office in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later
than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to
have made a Base Rate Revolving Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer. 
(iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because
the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not
so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Revolving Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C
Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Revolving Lender in satisfaction of its participation
obligation under this Section 2.03.  (iv) Until each Revolving Lender funds its Revolving Loan or
L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the
account of the L/C Issuer. 
  67 




(v) Each Revolving Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C
Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including
(A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or
continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this
Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Revolving Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise
impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
(vi) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount
required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover
from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at
a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection
(vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (d) Repayment of Participations. 
(i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Lender
such Lenders L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount
or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof
(appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lenders L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 
(ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 12.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each
Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such
Revolving Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. 
  68 




(e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C
Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the
following:  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan
Document;  (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, set-off, defense or other
right that the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any
other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
(iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 
(iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy,
debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such
Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law;  (v) waiver by the
L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for the L/C Issuers protection and not the protection of the Borrower or any waiver by the L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice the Borrower; 
(vi) honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires that demand be in the form
of a draft;  (vii) any payment made by the L/C Issuer in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date
specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under such Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the UCC or the ISP, as applicable; or 
(viii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other
circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary.  The
Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrowers instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will
promptly notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
 
  69 




(f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Revolving Lender and the Borrower agree that, in
paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to
the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C
Issuer shall be liable to any Revolving Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Revolving Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted
in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. The Borrower hereby
assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrowers
pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the
L/C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in subsections (i) through (v) of Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such subsections to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the
Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuers willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuers willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight
draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or
assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. The L/C Issuer may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from
the beneficiary via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication message or overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary. 
(g) Applicability of ISP98. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is
issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), the rules of the ISP shall apply to each Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible to the Borrower for, and the L/C
Issuers rights and remedies against the Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of the L/C Issuer required or expressly permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or expressly permitted to be applied to any
Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where the L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of
the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such
law or practice. 
  70 




(h) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Revolving Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share a Letter of Credit fee (the Letter of Credit Fee) equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under each
Letter of Credit. Letter of Credit Fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and shall be due and payable on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the
issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied
by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.  (i) Documentary and
Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit in such amounts and at such times as agreed from time to time by the
Borrower and the L/C Issuer, but in any event not to exceed 0.125% per annum.  (j) Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of
any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control.  (k) Letters of Credit
Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, any Person other than the Borrower, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the
L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby represents and warrants that the issuance of any Letters of Credit at the Borrowers request for the account of any other Person will inure to the
benefit of the Borrower.  2.04 Swingline Loans. 
(a) The Swingline. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of
the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.04, to make Revolving Loans (as defined in the Autoborrow Agreement) (each such loan, a Swingline Loan) to the Borrower from time to time during
the Availability Period on the terms and conditions set forth in the Autoborrow Agreement in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swingline Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swingline Loans, when
aggregated with the Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations of the Revolving Lender acting as Swingline Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lenders Revolving Commitment; provided,
however, that after giving effect to any Swingline Loan, (i) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of any Revolving
Lender, plus such Revolving Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Revolving Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all Swingline Loans shall not exceed such
Lenders Revolving Commitment. Immediately upon the making of a Swingline Loan, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swingline Lender a risk participation in such
Swingline Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Lenders Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Swingline Loan. 
  71 




(b) The Autoborrow Agreement. The terms of the Swingline Loans shall be governed by
the Autoborrow Agreement, including, without limitation, interest rates (including interest payable upon a Default or Event of Default), borrowing notices and the place, timing and manner of payments of interest, principal and other amounts;
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any refinancing of a Swingline Loan with a Revolving Loan, and any participation interest of a Revolving Lender in a Swingline Loan, shall be governed by this Agreement. 
(c) Refinancing of Swingline Loans. 
(i) The Swingline Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby
irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Lender make a Base Rate Revolving Loan in an amount equal to such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding;
provided that the Administrative Agent may from time to time (but no more frequently than once per week) in its sole and absolute discretion require that the Swingline Lender make such a request for Base Rate Revolving Loans. Such request
shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples
specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swingline Lender or the
Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Revolving Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Lender shall make an amount equal to its Pro Rata
Share of the amount specified in such Revolving Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds for the account of the Swingline Lender at the Administrative Agents Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day
specified in such Revolving Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Revolving Loan to the Borrower in such amount.
The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Lender.  (ii) If for any reason any Swingline
Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Revolving Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request
by the Swingline Lender that each of the Revolving Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and each Revolving Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to
Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. 
  72 




(iii) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in
Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such
payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest as aforesaid), the
amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swingline Loan, as the case may be.    A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any
Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(iv) Each Revolving Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline
Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment,
defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or
condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions
set forth in Section 4.02. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 
(d) Repayment of Participations. 
(i) At any time after any Revolving Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if the Swingline
Lender receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Revolving Lender through the Administrative Agent its Pro Rata Share of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest
payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Revolving Lenders risk participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the Swingline Lender. 
(ii) If any payment received by the Swingline Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swingline Loan is required to
be returned by the Swingline Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 12.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swingline Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to
the Swingline Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative
Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swingline Lender.  (e) Interest for Account of Swingline Lender. The Swingline
Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swingline Loans pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Autoborrow Agreement. Until each Revolving Lender funds its Base Rate Revolving Loan or risk participation
pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lenders Pro Rata Share of any Swingline Loan, interest in respect of such Pro Rata Share shall be solely for the account of the Swingline Lender. 
  73 




(f) Payments Directly to Swingline Lender. The Borrower shall make all payments of
principal and interest in respect of the Swingline Loans directly to the Swingline Lender.  2.05 Prepayments. 
(a) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Revolving Loans in whole or
in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be in a form agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower and be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three (3) Business
Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (B) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Revolving Loans; (ii) any prepayment of a Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a
whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of a Borrowing of Base Rate Revolving Loans shall be in a principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, such other
amount equal to the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment, the Type(s) and Facility of Revolving Loans to be prepaid and the conditions (which may only relate to the
incurrence of Indebtedness or the receipt of proceeds of a Disposition or capital contribution by the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries), if any, to such prepayment. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of
each such notice, and of the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on
the date specified therein, subject to satisfaction or waiver of any conditions specified in such notice (which conditions may only relate to the incurrence of Indebtedness or the receipt of proceeds of a Disposition or capital contribution by the
Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries). Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such
prepayment shall be applied to the Revolving Loans of the Lenders under the applicable Facility in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. 
(b) The Borrower may, at any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Swingline Loans in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Autoborrow Agreement.  (c) If for any reason the Total Revolving Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments then
in effect, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Revolving Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to Cash
Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) unless after the prepayment in full of the Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans the Total Revolving Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments
then in effect.  (d) Within five (5) Business Days after (i) any Restricted Debt Issuance by the Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary or (ii) the incurrence or issuance by the Borrower of any Permitted Unsecured Indebtedness or Permitted Junior Lien Indebtedness pursuant to Section 9.03(i)(i), the Borrower shall repay Loans in an aggregate
principal amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds from such Restricted Debt Issuance or incurrence or issuance of such unsecured Indebtedness or such Permitted Junior Lien Indebtedness and the Commitments of each Lender shall be ratably
reduced by, in the aggregate, the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds. 
  74 




(i) Within five (5) Business Days after the receipt by the Borrower or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Net Cash Proceeds of any Disposition of any Authority Property (other than a Pocono Disposition, a Mohegan Sun Disposition or Dispositions expressly permitted under Sections 9.05(a),
(b), (c), (d), (e), (f) (other than a Disposition in the form of a sale, rather than a lease, sublease or similar transaction), (g), (h), (i), (j) or (l)) or any
Extraordinary Loss, the Borrower shall repay Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds and the Commitments of each Lender shall be ratably reduced by, in the aggregate, the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds;
provided that if the Borrower shall certify at the time of such receipt that it intends to Reinvest all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds (the Net Cash Proceeds that are so designated for Reinvestment pursuant to such certification,
Designated Net Cash Proceeds), the Borrower may use the Designated Net Cash Proceeds for such purposes; provided further, that to the extent the Borrower shall not have Reinvested the Designated Net Cash Proceeds by
the date that is one year after the receipt thereof, the Borrower shall use any such remaining Designated Net Cash Proceeds that have not been Reinvested to repay Loans on such date and the Commitments of each Lender shall be ratably reduced by, in
the aggregate, the amount of such remaining Designated Net Cash Proceeds; provided, further, that any such Net Cash Proceeds received as a result of losses or the taking of assets at (A) Pocono may only be used in connection with
the foregoing provisos to replace, restore, repair or purchase capital assets used in connection with Pocono and (B) Mohegan Sun may only be used in connection with the foregoing provisos to replace, restore, repair or purchase capital assets
used in connection with Mohegan Sun; provided, further, that the Borrower shall not be required to repay Loans pursuant to this subsection (e)(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of Net Cash Proceeds from such Dispositions
and Extraordinary Losses (other than such Net Cash Proceeds that have been Reinvested pursuant to the foregoing provisos) is equal to or greater than $10,000,000; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower and
the Restricted Subsidiaries shall not have the right to elect to Reinvest the Net Cash Proceeds of any Disposition or series of related Dispositions with aggregate Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $100,000,000 and all of the Net Cash Proceeds of any
such Disposition or series of related Dispositions shall be required to repay Loans pursuant to this subsection (e)(i) and the Commitments of each Lender shall be ratably reduced by, in the aggregate, the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds.
 (ii) Within five (5) Business Days after the receipt by the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Net
Cash Proceeds of a Pocono Disposition, the Borrower shall prepay Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds and the Commitments of each Lender shall be ratably reduced by, in the aggregate, the amount of such Net
Cash Proceeds. 
  75 




(iii) Within five (5) Business Days after the receipt by the Borrower
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Net Cash Proceeds of a Mohegan Sun Disposition, the Borrower shall prepay Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds and the Commitments of each Lender shall be ratably
reduced by, in the aggregate, the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds.  (f) All prepayment of Loans made pursuant to subsections
(d) or (e) of this Section 2.05 shall be applied ratably to repay the Revolving Loans and reduce the Revolving Commitments. 
(g) The Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (who will notify each Lender) notice of each prepayment required under
Section 2.05(d) or (e) not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the date such prepayment shall be made (each such date, a Mandatory Prepayment Date). Such notice shall set forth
(i) the Mandatory Prepayment Date, (ii) the principal amount of each Loan (or portion thereof) to be prepaid and Commitments to be reduced and (iii) the Type of each Loan being prepaid. The Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent, at the time of each prepayment required under Sections 2.05(d) or (e), a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amount of such prepayment. 
(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05, any Net Cash Proceeds from any Disposition or
Extraordinary Loss otherwise required to be applied to prepay the Loans may, at the Borrowers option, be applied to prepay the principal amount of Incremental Equivalent Debt secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the
Obligations only to (and not in excess of) the extent to which a mandatory prepayment in respect of such Disposition or Extraordinary Loss is required under the terms of such Incremental Equivalent Debt (with any remaining Net Cash Proceeds applied
to prepay outstanding Loans and reduce Commitments in accordance with the terms hereof), unless such application would result in the holders of such Incremental Equivalent Debt receiving in excess of their pro rata share (determined on the
basis of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Loans and such Incremental Equivalent Debt at such time) of such Net Cash Proceeds relative to Lenders, in which case such Net Cash Proceeds may only be applied to prepay the principal amount of
such Incremental Equivalent Debt on a pro rata basis with outstanding Loans. To the extent the holders of such Incremental Equivalent Debt decline to have such indebtedness repurchased, repaid or prepaid with any such Net Cash Proceeds, the
declined amount of such Net Cash Proceeds shall promptly (and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days after the date of such rejection) be applied to prepay Loans and reduce Commitments in accordance with the terms hereof (to the extent
such Net Cash Proceeds would otherwise have been required to be applied if such Incremental Equivalent Debt was not then outstanding). Any such application to Incremental Equivalent Debt shall reduce any prepayments otherwise required hereunder by
an equivalent amount.  2.06 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative
Agent, terminate the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m.
five (5) Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Borrower shall not
terminate or reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Revolving Outstandings would exceed 
  76 





the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, and (iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swingline Sublimit exceeds
the amount of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, such sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate
Revolving Commitments. All fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. 
2.07 Repayment of Loans. 
(a) The Borrower shall repay in full to each Revolving Lender on the Maturity Date for any Revolving Credit Facility the aggregate principal
amount of Revolving Loans outstanding under such Facility on such date.  (b) The Borrower shall repay each Swingline Loan on the earlier to
occur of (i) the request of the Swingline Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(c), with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan, and (ii) the latest Maturity Date for any then-effective Revolving
Credit Facility.  2.08 Interest. 
(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each Revolving Loan under the Initial Revolving Credit Facility that is a
Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Revolving Loan
under the Initial Revolving Credit Facility that is a Base Rate Revolving Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable
Rate; (iii) each Swingline Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum set forth in the Autoborrow Agreement or any other rate as the Borrower and the Swingline
Lender may agree; (iv) each Other Revolving Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at the rate per annum set forth in the Refinancing Amendment for the applicable Facility; and (v) each Extended Revolving Loan
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at the rate per annum set forth in the Extension Amendment for the applicable Facility. 
(b) (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan (other than a Swingline Loan) is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace
periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. 
(ii) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan and Obligations in respect of Swingline Loans) payable by the Borrower
under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a
fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. 
  77 




(iii) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on
past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.  (iv) The Swingline Loans shall bear interest at the Default
Rate (as defined in the Autoborrow Agreement) as provided in the Autoborrow Agreement, which interest shall be payable on the terms set forth in the Autoborrow Agreement. 
(c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may
be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law. 
2.09 Fees. In addition to certain fees described in subsections (h) and (i) of Section 2.03: 
(a) Unused Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance with
its Pro Rata Share of each Revolving Credit Facility, an unused fee equal to the Applicable Rate for such Revolving Credit Facility times the actual daily amount by which the Aggregate Revolving Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the
Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Amount of Swingline Loans shall not be counted towards or considered usage of the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments for purposes of determining the unused fee. The unused fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Section 4.02 is not met,
and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date for any Revolving Credit Facility.
The unused fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such
quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.  (b) Upfront Fees. The Borrower shall pay to each Revolving Lender, on the Closing
Date, upfront fees in an amount equal to 0.50% of the Revolving Commitment of such Revolving Lender on the Closing Date.  (c) Other
Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Arrangers and the Administrative Agent such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. 
2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Rate. 
(a) All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate) shall be made
on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which
results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365 day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the
day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one (1) day. Each determination by the
Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
  78 




(b) If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of
the Borrower or for any other reason, the Borrower or the Lenders determine that (i) the Total Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Total Leverage Ratio
would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or,
after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under any Debtor Relief Law, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer), an amount equal
to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the
L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under Section 2.03(c)(iii), 2.03(i) or 2.08(b) or under Article X. 
2.11 Evidence of Debt. 
(a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the
Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the
Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the
event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of
manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lenders Loans under the applicable
Facility in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Revolving Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
(b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a), each Revolving Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Revolving Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained
by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Revolving Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.

2.12 Payments Generally. 
(a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agents Office in Dollars and
in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as
received by wire transfer to such Lenders Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to
accrue.  (b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next
following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.  (c) Unless the
Borrower has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has
timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the
proposed date of any Revolving Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Revolving Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of
a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then: 
(i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the
portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to
such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and 
(ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the
amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent
(the Compensation Period) at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such 
  80 





amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lenders Revolving Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith
upon the Administrative Agents demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation
Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative
Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.  A notice of the Administrative
Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
(d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing
provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV
are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 
(e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Loans and the obligations of the Revolving Lenders to fund participations in
Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation
to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Revolving Loan or purchase its participation. 
(f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a
representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.  2.13 Sharing
of Payments. If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein (including by way of a permitted assignment), any Lender shall obtain on account of the Revolving Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swingline Loans
held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender
shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders entitled to such payment such participations in the Revolving Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in the
participations in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Revolving Loans or such participations, as the case may be,
pro rata with each other Lender entitled to such payment; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in
Section 12.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the
purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lenders ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount 
  81 





of such paying Lenders required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in
respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 12.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of
such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such
purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with
respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased. 
2.14 [Reserved].  2.15
Incremental Facilities.  (a) Request for Increase. Provided there exists no Event of Default, upon notice to the
Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Borrower may from time to time request an increase in the Revolving Commitments under any Revolving Credit Facility (an Increased Revolving Commitment);
provided that (i) any such Increased Revolving Commitments shall be in a minimum amount of $10,000,000 and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Increased Revolving Commitments incurred pursuant to this
Section 2.15 on such date shall not exceed the Incremental Loan Amount as of the date of incurrence thereof.  (b)
Notification by the Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders. Any Increased Revolving Commitments may, at the option of the Borrower, be provided by existing Lenders or, subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approvals
shall not be unreasonably withheld) but only to the extent the Administrative Agents consent would be needed for an assignment to such Lender under Section 12.07, the Borrower may also invite additional Eligible
Assignees to become Lenders (each, an Additional Lender). For the avoidance of doubt, no existing Lender shall have any obligation to provide any portion of any Increased Revolving Commitments. 
(c) Closing Date and Allocations. The Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the lenders participating therein shall determine the
effective date (the Increase Effective Date) and the final allocation of any Increased Revolving Commitments. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and
the Increase Effective Date.  (d) Conditions to Effectiveness of Increases. As conditions precedent to any such increase, 
  82 




(i) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such increase,
(A) the representations and warranties contained in Articles V and VI and the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such
representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, except that any such representation or warranty qualified by materiality or as to Material Adverse Effect shall be
true and correct in all respects and except that for purposes of this Section 2.15, the representations and warranties contained in subsection (a) of Section 6.05 shall be deemed to
refer to the latest of the Audited Financial Statements and the most recent statements furnished pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of Section 8.01 and (B) no Event of Default shall exist, 
(ii) the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Increase Effective
Date signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (x) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such increase, (y) in the case of the Borrower, certifying that, the conditions
described in subsection (i) above have been satisfied,  (iii) the Administrative Agent shall have received a
joinder agreement (each, an Incremental Joinder) duly executed by the Borrower, each Lender providing any portion of such Increased Revolving Commitments and the Administrative Agent setting forth the commitments and other
provisions relevant to such Increased Revolving Commitments, which shall in each case be customary for facilities of such type and, in the case of any Additional Lender, include the agreement by such Additional Lender to become a party to this
Agreement,  (iv) the Borrower shall have delivered legal opinions, to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative
Agent, relating to such Increased Revolving Commitments covering matters similar to those covered in the opinions delivered on the Closing Date, 
(v) [reserved],  
(vi) any Lenders and Additional Lenders in respect of Increased Revolving Commitments may be paid such fees as the Borrower and
such Lenders and Additional Lenders may agree,  (vii) [reserved], 
(viii) if requested by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee (in each case, in its sole discretion), the
Administrative Agent and Collateral Trustee shall have received modification endorsements, or a commitment acceptable to the Administrative Agent to obtain modification endorsements, to the title policies increasing the title insurance thereunder to
an aggregate amount of not less than the sum of the Revolving Commitment (as increased by any Increased Revolving Commitment), 
(ix) the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee shall have received such amendments and modifications in respect of
the Collateral (including date-downs of the title policies) as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee may reasonably request, and 
  83 




(x) after giving effect to such Increased Revolving Commitments, the
Borrower would be in compliance with Section 9.10 on a Pro Forma Basis (calculated as though any such Increased Revolving Commitments were fully drawn). 
If the Borrower increases the Revolving Commitments (a) each Revolving Lender immediately prior to such increase will automatically and
without further act be deemed to have assigned to each lender providing a portion of the Increased Revolving Commitments (each, a Revolving Commitment Increase Lender), and each such Revolving Commitment Increase Lender will
automatically and without further act be deemed to have assumed, a portion of such Revolving Lenders participations hereunder in outstanding Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans such that, after giving effect to each such deemed assignment
and assumption of participations, the percentage of the aggregate outstanding (i) participations hereunder in Letters of Credit and (ii) participations hereunder in Swingline Loans held by each Revolving Lender (including each such
Revolving Commitment Increase Lender) will equal the percentage of the aggregate Revolving Commitments of all Revolving Lenders represented by such Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment and (b) if, on the date of such increase, there are
any Revolving Loans outstanding, the Borrower shall, in coordination with the Administrative Agent, repay outstanding Revolving Loans of certain of the Revolving Lenders, and incur additional Revolving Loans from certain other Revolving Lenders, in
each case to the extent necessary so that all of the Revolving Lenders participate in each outstanding Borrowing of Revolving Loans in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share (after giving effect to any increase in the Revolving Commitments
pursuant to this Section 2.15) and with the Borrower being obligated to pay to the respective Revolving Lenders any costs of the type referred to in Section 3.05 in connection with any such
repayment and/or Borrowing. The Borrower shall also pay any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, Attorney Costs) incurred in connection with the increase of any Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.15. 
(e) Equal and Ratable Benefit. The Loans and Commitments established pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall constitute Loans
and Commitments under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, (x) benefit equally and ratably from the Guaranty and the Collateral and
constitute Priority Lien Obligations under the Collateral Trust Agreement and (y) not have any borrower or guarantors other than the Borrower and the Guarantors or benefit from any collateral other than the Collateral. Any Increased Revolving
Commitments shall have terms identical to the terms of the existing Revolving Commitments of the relevant Revolving Credit Facility hereunder; provided, however, that (A) upfront fees may be paid to Lenders providing such
Increased Revolving Commitments as agreed by such Lenders and the Borrower and (B) the conditions applicable to the incurrence of such Increased Revolving Commitments shall be as provided in this Section 2.15. 
(f) Conflicting Provisions. This Section 2.15 shall supersede any provisions in
Section 2.13 or 12.01 to the contrary. 
  84 




2.16 Cash Collateral. 
(a) Certain Credit Support Events. If there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one (1) Business Day following any written
request by the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to
Section 2.17(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount. 
(b) Grant of Security Interest. The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants
to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority lien and security interest in all cash, deposit accounts and all
balances therein employed to Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations in accordance with Section 2.16(a) and Section 2.17, and in all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all
proceeds of the foregoing, as security for the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations, to be applied pursuant to Section 2.16(c). If at any time the Administrative Agent
determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer as herein provided (other than Permitted Liens), or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the
Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to
Section 2.17(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).  (c) Application.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.16 or Section 2.17 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to
the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash
Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.  (d) Release.
Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce the L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure shall be released pursuant to this Section 2.16 following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting
Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 12.06(b)(vi))), or (ii) the determination by the
Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided, however, that, subject to Section 2.17 the Person providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer may agree that Cash
Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.  2.17
Defaulting Lenders.  (a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender
becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law: 
(i) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or
consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders, and Section 12.01. 
  85 




(ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest,
fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article X or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting
Lender pursuant to Section 12.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the
Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers
Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.16; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect
of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit
account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers future Fronting
Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.16; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the
L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its
obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against
such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if
(x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were
issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all
Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded
participations in L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder without giving effect to Section 2.17(a)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other
amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.17(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by
such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  (iii) Certain Fees. 
(A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under Section 2.09(a) for any
period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender). 
  86 




(B) Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit
Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Pro Rata Share of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to
Section 2.16.  (C) With respect to any Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any
Defaulting Lender pursuant to subsection (A) or (B) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting
Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lenders participation in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to subsection (iv) below,
(y) pay to the L/C Issuer and Swingline Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuers or Swingline Lenders Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting
Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.  (iv) Reallocation of Applicable
Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders participation in L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause any Non-Defaulting Lenders aggregate Pro Rata Share of the Total Revolving Outstandings to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment. Subject to
Section 12.29, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim
of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation. 
(v) Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Loans. If the reallocation described in subsection (a)(iv) above
cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Law, (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline
Lenders Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.16. 
(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender and the L/C Issuer agree in writing that
a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with
respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders under the applicable Facility or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to
be necessary to cause the Revolving Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans under any Facility to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares of such
Facility (without giving effect to Section 2.17(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments
made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender
will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. 
  87 




2.18 [Reserved]. 
2.19 Refinancing Amendments. 
(a) At any time after the Closing Date, the Borrower may obtain Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of all or any portion of
the Revolving Loans (or unused Revolving Commitments) then outstanding under this Agreement (which for purposes of this subsection (a) will be deemed to include any Revolving Loan (or unused Revolving Commitments) under the Initial
Revolving Credit Facility, Other Revolving Loans (or unused Other Revolving Commitments) and Extended Revolving Loans), in the form of Other Revolving Loans or Other Revolving Commitments pursuant to a Refinancing Amendment; provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.19 or otherwise, (1) the borrowing and repayment of Loans with respect to Other Revolving Commitments after the date of obtaining any Other Revolving
Commitments shall be made on a pro rata basis with all other Revolving Commitments, except in the case of (A) payments of interest and fees at different rates on Other Revolving Commitments (and related outstandings), (B) repayments
required upon the maturity date of any Facility and (C) repayment made in connection with a permanent repayment and termination of commitments of any Facility (subject to subsection (2) below), (2) the permanent repayment of
Revolving Loans with respect to, and termination of, Revolving Commitments after the date of obtaining any Other Revolving Commitments shall be made on a pro rata basis among all Revolving Commitments, except that the Borrower shall be
permitted to permanently repay and terminate commitments under any Facility on a non-pro rata basis if such Facility has an earlier maturity date than any Facility not so reduced, and (3) assignments and participations of Other Revolving
Commitments and Other Revolving Loans shall be governed by the same assignment and participation provisions applicable to Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans. The effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction
on the date thereof of each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02, and to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, receipt by the Administrative Agent of (i) a certificate of each Loan Party
dated as of the effective date of such Refinancing Amendment signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (x) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such refinancing, (y) in the
case of the Borrower, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such refinancing, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Articles V and VI and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of such
date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.19,
the representations and warranties contained in subsection (a) of Section 6.05 shall be deemed to refer to the latest of the Audited Financial Statements and the most recent statements furnished pursuant to
subsections (a) and (b) of Section 8.01, and (B) no Default exists, and (ii) legal opinions reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent relating to the matters described above covering
matters similar to those covered in the opinions delivered on the Closing Date. Each issuance of Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness under this Section 2.19(a) shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is (x) not less
than $5,000,000 and (y) an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. 
  88 




(b) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of
each Refinancing Amendment. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and
terms of the Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness incurred pursuant thereto (including any amendments necessary to treat the Loans and Commitments subject thereto as Other Revolving Loans and Other Revolving Commitments, as applicable). Any
Refinancing Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to
effect the provisions of this Section 2.19.  (c) This Section 2.19 shall supersede any
provisions in Section 2.13 or 12.01 to the contrary.  2.20 Extension of Loans and Commitments.
 (a) The Borrower may at any time request that all or a portion of the Revolving Commitments of any then existing Facility (an
Existing Revolving Facility and any related Revolving Loans thereunder, Existing Revolving Loans) be modified to constitute another Facility of Revolving Commitments in order to extend the scheduled maturity
date thereof (any such Revolving Commitments which have been so modified, Extended Revolving Commitments and any related Revolving Loans, Extended Revolving Loans) and to provide for other terms consistent with
this Section 2.20. In order to establish any Extended Revolving Commitments, the Borrower shall provide a notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall provide a copy of such notice to each of the Lenders of the applicable
Existing Revolving Facility) (a Revolving Extension Request) setting forth the proposed terms of the Extended Revolving Commitments to be established, which terms shall be identical to those applicable to the Revolving Commitments
of the Existing Revolving Facility from which they are to be modified except (i) the scheduled termination date of the Extended Revolving Commitments and the related scheduled maturity date of the related Extended Revolving Loans shall be
extended to the date set forth in the applicable Extension Amendment, (ii) (A) the interest rate with respect to the Extended Revolving Loans may be higher or lower than the interest rate for the Revolving Loans of such Existing Revolving
Facility and/or (B) additional fees may be payable to the Lenders providing such Extended Revolving Commitments, in each case, to the extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment, (iii) the Applicable Rate with respect to the
Extended Revolving Commitments may be higher or lower than the Applicable Rate for the Revolving Commitments of such Existing Revolving Facility and (iv) the covenants set forth in Article IX may be modified in a manner acceptable to the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders party to the applicable Extension Amendment, such modifications to become effective only after the latest Maturity Date of any Facility in effect immediately prior to giving effect to such Extension
Amendment (it being understood that each Lender providing Extended Revolving Commitments, by executing an Extension Amendment, agrees to be bound by such provisions and waives any inconsistent provisions set forth in
Section 2.13 or Section 12.09). Each Lender holding Extended Revolving Commitments shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by this Agreement (including,

  89 





without limitation, the provisions set forth in Section 2.05 applicable to Existing Revolving Loans) and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the
foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from the Guaranties and the Collateral and constitute Priority Lien Secured Party under the Collateral Trust Agreement. No Lender shall have any obligation to agree to have any of its Revolving Commitments of
any Existing Revolving Facility modified to constitute Extended Revolving Commitments pursuant to any Revolving Extension Request. Any Extended Revolving Commitments established pursuant to the same Extension Amendment shall constitute a separate
facility of Revolving Commitments (each, an Extended Revolving Facility) from the Existing Revolving Facility from which they were modified. If, on the date of any extension, any Revolving Loans of any Extending Lender are
outstanding under the applicable Existing Revolving Facility, such Revolving Loans (and any related participations) shall be deemed to be allocated as Extended Revolving Loans (and related participations) in the same proportion as such Extending
Lenders Extended Revolving Commitments bear to its remaining Revolving Commitments of the Existing Revolving Facility. In addition, if so provided in the relevant Extension Amendment and with the consent of the applicable L/C Issuer, upon the
termination of Revolving Commitments under a Revolving Credit Facility with an earlier Maturity Date than an Extended Revolving Facility, participations in Letters of Credit under such Revolving Credit Facility shall be re-allocated from Lenders of such Revolving Credit Facility to Lenders holding Extended Revolving Commitments in accordance with the terms of such Extension Amendment; provided that (i) such
participation interests shall, upon receipt thereof by the relevant Lenders holding Extended Revolving Commitments, be deemed to be participation interests in respect of such Extended Revolving Commitments and the terms of such participation
interests (including, without limitation, the commission applicable thereto) shall be adjusted accordingly and (ii) such re-allocation shall not cause the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving
Loans of any Revolving Lender, plus such Revolving Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Revolving Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all Swingline Loans to
exceed such Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment.  (b) The Borrower shall provide the applicable Extension Request at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the date on which Lenders under the existing Facility are requested to respond. Any Lender wishing to have all or a portion of its Revolving Commitments of the existing Facility subject to such Extension Request
modified to constitute Extended Revolving Loans and related Commitments (an Extending Lender) shall notify the Administrative Agent (an Extension Election) on or prior to the date specified in such Extension
Request of the amount of its Revolving Commitments of the existing Facility which it has elected to modify to constitute Extended Revolving Loans and related Commitments. In the event that the aggregate amount of Revolving Commitments of the
existing Facility subject to Extension Elections exceeds the amount of Extended Revolving Loans and related Commitments requested pursuant to the Extension Request or Revolving Commitments subject to such Extension Elections shall be modified to
constitute Extended Revolving Loans and related Commitments on a pro rata basis based on the amount of Revolving Commitments included in such Extension Elections. The Borrower shall have the right to withdraw any Extension Request upon
written notice to the Administrative Agent. 
  90 




(c) Extended Revolving Loans and related Commitments shall be established pursuant to an
amendment (an Extension Amendment) to this Agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Each Extension Amendment shall be executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Extending Lenders (it being
understood that such Extension Amendment shall not require the consent of any Lender other than the Extending Lenders with respect to the Extended Revolving Loans and related Commitments established thereby) extending their respective Loans and
Commitments thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Extension Amendment. An Extension Amendment may, subject to Section 2.20(a), without the consent of any
other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or advisable, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this
Section 2.20 (including, without limitation, such technical amendments as may be necessary or advisable, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to give effect to the terms and provisions of
any Extended Revolving Loans and related Commitments); provided that each Lender whose Loans or Commitments are affected by such Extension Amendment shall have approved such Extension Amendment. 
(d) The effectiveness of any Extension Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction on the date thereof of each of the conditions set forth
in Section 4.02, and to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, receipt by the Administrative Agent of (i) a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the effective date of such Refinancing
Amendment signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (x) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such extension, (y) in the case of the Borrower, certifying that, before and
after giving effect to such extension, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Articles V and VI and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of such date, except to the extent that such representations
and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.20, the representations and warranties contained in
subsection (a) of Section 6.05 shall be deemed to refer to the latest of the Audited Financial Statements and the most recent statements furnished pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of
Section 8.01, and (B) no Default exists, and (ii) legal opinions reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent relating to the matters described above covering matters similar to those covered in the opinions
delivered on the Closing Date.  (e) This Section 2.20 shall supersede any provisions in
Section 2.13 or 12.01 to the contrary.  2.21 Benchmark Replacement Setting. 
(a) Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition
Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if
a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) or (2) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes
hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a
Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (3) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark 
  91 





Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th)
Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent
has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. 
(b) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent
will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will
become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.  (c) Notices;
Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in
Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of
any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (d) below and (v) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable,
any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.21 including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or
date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.21.  (d) Unavailability of Tenor of
Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term
SOFR or the Eurodollar Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion
or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative
Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed
pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no
longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously
removed tenor. 
  92 




(e) Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Borrowers receipt of notice of
the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and,
failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is
not an Available Tenor, the component of the Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Base Rate. 
ARTICLE III  TAXES,
YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY  3.01 Taxes. 
(a) Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes. 
(i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without
deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the applicable withholding agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such
payment by the Administrative Agent, a Loan Party, or any other applicable withholding agent, then the Administrative Agent, such Loan Party, or such withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding. 
(ii) If any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent, or any other applicable withholding agent shall be required by any applicable
Laws to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including, but not limited to, United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent or other applicable withholding agent shall withhold
or make such deductions as are reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent or such withholding agent to be required, (B) the Administrative Agent or other applicable withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted
to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the applicable Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as
necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.  (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.
Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the
payment by the Administrative Agent to the relevant Governmental Authority (provided the Administrative Agent delivers to Borrower evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Borrower) of, any Other Taxes. 
  93 




(i) The Borrower shall, and does hereby indemnify each Recipient, and shall
make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section 3.01) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified
Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after
demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section 3.01(b)(ii) below. 
(ii) Each Lender shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after
demand therefor, (x) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that a Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without
limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (y) the Administrative Agent and the Loan Parties, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of
Section 12.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Administrative Agent and the Loan Parties, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case,
that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this subsection (ii). 
(c) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority as
provided in this Section 3.01, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to
report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
  94 




(d) Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation. 
(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any
Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or
information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
Section 3.01(d)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material
unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  (ii) Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing,  (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;  (B)
any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender
becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 
(I) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party
(x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as
applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the
business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;  (II) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;  (III) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption
for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the
meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in
Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable); or 
  95 




(IV) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed
copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-2 or Exhibit G-3, IRS
Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign
Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-4 on behalf of each such direct and
indirect partner;  (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request
of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary
documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if
such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code)
and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has
complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this subsection (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the
date of this Agreement.  (iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to
this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall promptly (x) notify Borrower and the Administrative Agent of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy, and (y) update such
form or certification or notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
  96 




(e) FATCA. For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from
and after the Closing Date, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to treat) this Agreement as not qualifying as a grandfathered obligation within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).  (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If
any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.01 (including by the payment of additional
amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to
such refund), net of all reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the
relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragrap

ty) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no
event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net
after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the
indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes
that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.  (g) Each partys obligations under this
Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Revolving Commitments and the repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.  (h) For purposes of this Section 3.01, for
the avoidance of doubt, the term Lender includes the L/C Issuer and the Swingline Lender, and the term Laws includes FATCA. 
3.02 Illegality. If any Lender determines that as a result of any Change in Law any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental
Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain, issue or fund Credit Extensions whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender
to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to such Credit Extensions or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Revolving Loans to
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from
such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the 
  97 





Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such
Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for
such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.  3.03
Inability to Determine Rates. If the Required Lenders determine (i) (A) that dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable requested amount and Interest Period with respect to a proposed
Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (B) that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan (in each case with respect to this
subsection (i), Impacted Loans), or (ii) that the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of
funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender under the applicable Facility. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans under such Facility shall be
suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar
Rate Loans under such Facility or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans under such Facility in the amount specified therein. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if relevant Lenders have made the determination described in subsection (i) of the first sentence
of this Section 3.03, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower and the affected Lenders, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest
shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Required Lenders revoke the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under such Facility under subsection (i) of the first sentence of this section,
(2) the Required Lenders for such Facility notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any
Lender under such Facility determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is
determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and
provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof.  3.04 Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy;
Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.  (a) Changes in Law. If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e)) or the L/C Issuer; 
  98 




(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than, in each case,
(A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in subsections (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other
obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or  (iii) impose on any Lender
or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or
maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, the L/C Issuer or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its
obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon
request of such Lender, the L/C Issuer or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, the L/C Issuer or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, the L/C Issuer or other
Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or
the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or
would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or the L/C Issuers capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments
of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lenders
or the L/C Issuers holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or the L/C Issuers policies and the policies of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company
with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lenders or the L/C
Issuers holding company for any such reduction suffered.  (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or the
L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after receipt thereof. 
  99 




(d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer
to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers right to demand such compensation, provided that the
Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C
Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
(e) Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain
reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as Eurocurrency liabilities), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal
to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan,
provided the Borrower shall have received at least 15 days prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant Interest
Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 30 days from receipt of such notice.  3.05 Compensation for Losses.
Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  (b) any failure by the
Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or 
(c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 12.16;  including any loss of anticipated profits solely attributable to a decline in the
Eurodollar Rate after the date such Loan was made and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
 For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed
to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such
Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded. Any Lender making a claim for compensation for losses pursuant to this Section 3.05 shall make such claim within 30 days after such Lender first becomes aware of the loss, cost or
expense incurred by it. 
  100 




3.06 Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation. 
(a) A certificate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Article III and setting forth the
additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder (including calculations thereof in reasonable detail) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may use any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Any and all claims for compensation under this Article III (other than Sections 3.01 and 3.05) shall be made by a Lender within 180 days after such Lender becomes aware of the facts
or circumstances giving rise to such claim. Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any request for compensation under this
Article III and take any other action available to reduce or mitigate such costs in each case if such action will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. 
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified
Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office
in accordance with Section 3.06(a), the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 12.16(b). 
3.07 Survival. All of the Borrowers obligations under this Article III shall survive payment in full of
the Obligations hereunder.  ARTICLE IV

whereupon such commitments and obligation shall be terminated;  (b) declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans, all
interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby

Outstanding Amount thereof); and  (d) exercise on behalf of itself and the Lenders all rights and remedies available to it and the Lenders
under the Loan Documents or applicable law;  provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief

  149 




10.04 Application of Funds. After the exercise of remedies provided for in
Section 10.03 (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately due and payable and the L/C Obligations have automatically been required to be Cash Collateralized as set forth in the proviso to
Section 10.03), any amounts received on account of the Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative Agent in the following order: 
First, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts other than principal
and interest (including Attorney Costs and amounts payable under Article III) payable to each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee in its capacity as such; 
Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal and
interest) payable to the Lenders (including Attorney Costs and amounts payable under Article III), ratably among them in proportion to the amounts described in this clause Second payable to them; 
Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans, L/C Borrowings and other
Obligations and fees, premiums and scheduled periodic payments under any Secured Hedge Agreements, ratably among the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Hedge Banks in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third payable to
them;  Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid principal of the Loans and L/C Borrowings,
breakage, termination and other payments due to any Hedge Bank under any Secured Hedge Agreement and remaining payments due to any Cash Management Bank under any Secured Cash Management Agreement, ratably among the Lenders, the L/C Issuer, the Hedge
Banks and the Cash Management Banks in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held by them; 
Fifth, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer, to Cash Collateralize that portion of L/C Obligations comprised
of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit; and  Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations (including, for
purposes of this clause Last, all Obligations arising under any Secured Hedge Agreement or Secured Cash Management Agreement) have been paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law. 
Subject to Section 2.03(c), amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause
Fifth above shall be applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur. If any amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall
be applied to the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Obligations arising under Secured
Hedge Agreements and Secured Cash Management Agreements shall be excluded from the application described above if the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee have not received written notice thereof, together with such supporting
documentation as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee may request, from the applicable Hedge Bank or Cash Management Bank and (ii) amounts 
  150 





received from any Loan Party shall not be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligation of such Loan Party. Each Hedge Bank and Cash Management Bank not a party to the Credit Agreement that has given
the notice contemplated by the preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the appointment of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of Article XI hereof and the Collateral Trustee pursuant to
the terms of Section 3.1 of the Collateral Trust Agreement for itself and its Affiliates as if a Lender party hereto. 
10.05 Right to Cure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 10.01 or 10.03, 
(a) if the Borrower determines that an Event of Default under the covenant set forth in Section 9.19(a) has occurred
or may occur, on or prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date on which the certificate required to be delivered hereunder pursuant to Section 8.02(i)(i) with respect to such calendar month (the Liquidity
Cure Expiration Date), a Specified Tribal Contribution may be made in the form of cash common equity (or equity that would be common equity if the Borrower were a corporation), and the amount of the net cash proceeds thereof
shall be deemed to increase Liquidity as of the last day of such calendar month provided that such net cash proceeds are actually received by the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries on or prior to the Liquidity Cure Expiration Date; and 
(b) in the event the Borrower fails to comply with any financial covenant set forth in Section 9.10 as of the last
day of any Fiscal Quarter, any Specified Tribal Contribution made in the form of cash common equity (or equity that would be common equity if the Borrower were a corporation) during such Fiscal Quarter or after the last day of the
applicable Fiscal Quarter with respect to which such covenants are being tested and on or prior to the day that is ten (10) days after the day on which financial statements are required to be delivered for such Fiscal Quarter will, at the
irrevocable election of the Borrower, be included in the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA solely for the purposes of determining compliance with such covenants at the end of such Fiscal Quarter and any subsequent period that includes such Fiscal
Quarter (any such equity contribution so included in the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA, a Specified Equity Contribution); provided that (a) notice of the Borrowers intent to make a Specified Equity
Contribution shall be delivered no later than the day on which financial statements are required to be delivered for the applicable Fiscal Quarter, (b) in each consecutive four-Fiscal Quarter period there will be at least two (2) Fiscal
Quarters in which no Specified Equity Contribution is made, (c) the amount of any Specified Equity Contribution will be no greater than the amount required to cause the Loan Parties to be in compliance with the financial covenants in
Section 9.10, (d) all Specified Equity Contributions will be disregarded for purposes of the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for all other purposes, including calculating basket levels, pricing and other items governed
by reference to Consolidated EBITDA, (e) there shall be no more than five (5) Specified Equity Contributions made in the aggregate after the Closing Date, (f) the proceeds received by the Borrower from all Specified Equity
Contributions shall be promptly used by the Borrower to prepay the Revolving Loans (without a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments), if any, outstanding, and (g) any Indebtedness prepaid with the proceeds of Specified
Equity Contributions shall be deemed outstanding for purposes of determining compliance with the financial covenants in Section 9.10 for the current Fiscal Quarter (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not the three
(3) Fiscal Quarters thereafter). 
  151 




Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 10.01 and
Section 10.03, (A) upon any Specified Tribal Contribution in an amount necessary to cure any Event of Default under the covenants set forth in Section 9.10 and
Section 9.19(a), such covenants will be deemed satisfied and complied with as of the end of the relevant period with the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply with such covenant and any Event of Default
under such covenant (and any other Default as a result thereof) will be deemed not to have occurred for purposes of the Loan Documents, and (B) from and after the date that Borrower delivers a written notice to the Administrative Agent that it
intends to exercise its cure right under this Section 10.05 (a Notice of Intent to Cure) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender may exercise any rights or remedies under
Section 10.03 (or under any other Loan Document) on the basis of any actual or purported Event of Default under the covenants set forth in Section 9.10 and Section 9.19(a)
with respect to the period for which a Notice of Intent to Cure has been provided (and any other Default as a result thereof) until the date specified in sub-section (a) or (b) above, as applicable.
Following a breach of Section 9.10 or Section 9.19(a), no Revolving Lender, Swingline Lender or L/C Issuer shall have any obligation to make any Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans or honor any
request for an L/C Credit Extension until the Specified Tribal Contribution is consummated or such Event of Default is otherwise cured (including in the case of Section 9.19(a), by satisfying such covenant as of the last
day of any subsequent calendar month).  ARTICLE XI

any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Collateral Trustee, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article XI and Article XII (including
Sections 12.04 and 12.05 as though such co-agents, sub-agents and
attorneys-in-fact were the collateral agent or security trustee under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.

  152 




(c) The Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to appoint Citizens Bank, as
Collateral Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties and the other Priority Lien Secured Parties (as defined in the Collateral Trust Agreement) pursuant to the Collateral Trust Agreement and for the purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on

amendments and agreements supplemental to this Agreement, the Collateral Trust Agreement or any other Loan Document for the purpose of curing any defect, inconsistency, omission or ambiguity in this Agreement, the Collateral Trust Agreement or any
other Loan Document to which the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee is a party or to make administrative changes that are not adverse to any Secured Party (in each case without any consent or approval by the Secured Parties) if the same
is not objected to in writing by the Required Lenders within five (5) Business Days following receipt of notice thereof. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Collateral Trustee (to the extent acting on behalf of the Secured
Parties) shall be deemed to be an agent hereunder and shall be the beneficiary of all the rights of an agent hereunder, including all provisions of this Article XI and Article XII
(including Sections 12.04 and 12.05 as though the Collateral Trustee was the administrative agent, collateral agent or security trustee under the Loan Documents). Notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Collateral Trustee shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents to which it is a party. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (a) the Collateral Trustee shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (b) except as expressly set forth herein, the
Collateral Trustee shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Tribe, the Borrower or any of the other Loan Parties or Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by

genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly
required to be delivered to the Collateral Trustee.  11.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Trustee hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee and the term Lender or
Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent

capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee hereunder and without any duty to account therefor
to the Lenders.  11.03 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Trustee shall have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth herein, the Collateral Trust Agreement and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee: 
(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; 
(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated hereby or by the Collateral Trust Agreement and the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee, as applicable, is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein, in the Collateral Trust Agreement or in the other Loan Documents), provided that neither the Administrative Agent note the Collateral Trustee shall be
required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; and 
(c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the
failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. 
Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Trustee shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the
request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as it shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 12.01 and
10.03) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such
Default is given to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee by the Borrower, a Lender or the L/C Issuer.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor
the Collateral Trustee shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, the Collateral Trust Agreement or any other Loan Document,
(ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions
set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, the Collateral Trust Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or

Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee. 
  154 




11.04 Reliance by the Agents. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Trustee shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website
posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee also may rely upon any statement made to it orally
or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit,
that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for
the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
11.05 Delegation of Duties. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee may perform any and all of its duties and
exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee, as applicable. Each of the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Trustee and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory
provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee and any such sub-agent,
and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent or Collateral Trustee. 
11.06 Resignation of the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders,
the L/C Issuer and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an
Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of
its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that in no event shall any successor
Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender; provided further that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become
effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of

  155 





any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such
collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each
Lender and the L/C Issuer directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless
otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Sections 12.04 and
12.05 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of
them (i) while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent and (ii) after such resignation or removal for as long as any of them continues to act in any capacity hereunder or under the other Loan Documents,
including (a) acting as collateral agent or otherwise holding any collateral security on behalf of any of the Lenders and (b) in respect of any actions taken in connection with transferring the agency to any successor Administrative Agent.
 Any resignation by Citizens Bank as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer
with respect to the issuance of any Letter of Credit after the effective date of such resignation, if applicable. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and
become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer, (ii) the retiring L/C Issuer shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and
(iii) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume
the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit.  11.07
Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Trustee or
any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer also acknowledges that
it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Trustee or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate,
continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
11.08 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Arrangers shall have any powers, duties or
responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Trustee, a Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder. 
  156 




11.09 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim; Credit Bidding. In case of the
pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein
expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: 
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and
all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent under
Sections 2.03(h) and (i), 2.09, 12.04 and 12.05) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 
(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender and the L/C Issuer to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, if the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount
due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09, 12.04 and
12.05.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or
adopt on behalf of any Lender or the L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of
the claim of any Lender or the L/C Issuer or in any such proceeding.  The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative
Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations (including accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or
otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Debtor Relief Laws, including under Sections
363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar Laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is subject, (b) at any other sale or foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at
the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable Law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to
be, and shall be, credit 
  157 





bid on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that would vest upon the
liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) in the asset or assets so purchased (or in the equity interests or debt instruments of the
acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such purchase). In connection with any such bid (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles to make a bid, (ii) to adopt
documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests
thereof shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by the vote of the Required Lenders, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in subsections
(a) through (k) of Section 12.01 of this Agreement), (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to assign the relevant Obligations to any such acquisition vehicle pro rata by the Lenders, as a
result of which each of the Lenders shall be deemed to have received a pro rata portion of any equity interests and/or debt instruments issued by such an acquisition vehicle on account of the assignment of the Obligations to be credit bid,
all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (iv) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of
another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of debt credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the
Lenders pro rata and the equity interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of the Obligations that had been assigned to the acquisition vehicle shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any
Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action.  11.10 Collateral and Guaranty Matters. The Lenders and the L/C
Issuer irrevocably authorize each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee, as applicable, at its option and in its discretion, 
(a) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee under any Loan Document
(including, as applicable, by way of amending or subdividing the Leasehold Mortgage in connection with an amendment of the Lease in connection with a transaction pursuant to Section 9.05(f)) (i) upon termination of the
Facilities and payment in full of all Obligations under this Agreement, (ii) in connection with a corporate restructuring of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries so long as after giving effect thereto substantially all Collateral of each Guarantor
remains Collateral, (iii) that is sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of or to be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of to a Person that is not required to be a Loan Party as part of or in connection with any sale, transfer or other
disposition not prohibited hereunder or under any other Loan Document (and the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee acknowledge that, in the case of this clause (iii), the Liens on the applicable property shall be released
automatically upon consummation of such transaction), or (iv) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing in accordance with Section 12.01; 
(b) to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty and the Security Documents if such Person is not a Restricted Subsidiary
or will cease to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder; 
  158 




(c) to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty and the Security
Documents as a result of a corporate restructuring of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries so long as after giving effect thereto each Person that is required to be a Guarantor pursuant to the terms hereof becomes or continues to be a Guarantor; 
(d) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee under any Loan Document to
the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 9.01(o); and  (e) to enter into the
Collateral Trust Agreement, Customary Intercreditor Agreements or any joinder agreement thereto to the extent permitted by Sections 9.01 and 9.03 hereof, it being understood that the Liens securing any Indebtedness permitted to be
incurred hereunder on a junior secured basis relative to the Obligations may rank junior to, pari-passu with or senior to the Liens securing the Second Lien Notes, to the extent consistent with the terms of the Second Lien Notes Indenture. 
Upon request by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the
Administrative Agents or the Collateral Trustees, as applicable, authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty or to enter
into Customary Intercreditor Agreements pursuant to this Section 11.10. In each case as specified in this Section 11.10, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee, as applicable, will, at
the Borrowers expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the
Security Documents or to subordinate its interest in such item, or to release such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, and will enter into Customary Intercreditor Agreements, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan
Documents, the Collateral Trust Agreement and this Section 11.10.  11.11 Secured Hedge Agreements and Secured
Cash Management Agreements. No Hedge Bank or Cash Management Bank that obtains the benefits of Section 10.04, the Guaranty or any Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or of the Guaranty or any other Loan
Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) other
than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article XI to the contrary, none of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Trustee shall be obligated to any Lender to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Obligations arising under Secured Hedge Agreements or Secured Cash Management Agreements unless the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee, as applicable, has received written notice of such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee may request, from the applicable Hedge
Bank or Cash Management Bank.

(i) if to the Tribe, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Trustee, the L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender, to
the address, facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone number specified for such Person on Schedule 12.02 or to such other address, facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone number as shall be
designated by such party in a notice to the other parties; and 
  163 




(ii) if to any other Lender, to the address, facsimile number, electronic
mail address or telephone number specified in its Administrative Questionnaire or to such other address, facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone number as shall be designated by such party in a notice to the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swingline Lender.  Notices sent by hand or overnight courier service, or mailed by certified or registered
mail, shall be deemed to have been given when received; notices sent by facsimile shall be deemed to have been given when sent, if a confirmation of transmittal is confirmed (except that, if not given during normal business hours for the recipient,
shall be deemed to have been given at the opening of business on the next business day for the recipient). Notices delivered through electronic communications to the extent provided in subsection (b) below, shall be effective as provided in
such subsection (b).  (b) Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer hereunder
may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail, FpML messaging and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent, provided that
the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender and the L/C Issuer pursuant to Article II if such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving
notices under such Article by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by
it, provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.  Unless the Administrative
Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the senders receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such
as by the return receipt requested function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), provided that if such notice or other communication is not sent during the normal
business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next business day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website
shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing subsection (i) of notification that such notice or
communication is available and identifying the website address therefor.  THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND AS
AVAILABLE. THE AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS. NO
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE
DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY 
  164 





AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent
Parties) have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrowers or the
Administrative Agents transmission of the Borrower Materials or notices through the Platform, any other electronic platform or electronic messaging service, or through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event
shall any Agent Party have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages). 
(c) Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Loan Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile or other form of
electronic transmission (including by electronic imaging). The effectiveness of any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable Law, have the same force and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding on all Loan Parties,
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent may also require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a manually-signed original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request or deliver
the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any such document or signature.  (d) Reliance by the Administrative Agent and
Lenders. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including telephonic notices and Revolving Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices
were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The
Borrower shall indemnify each Agent-Related Person and each Lender from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic notices
to and other communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording. 
12.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person
in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law. 
12.04 Attorney Costs and Expenses. The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee
for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development, preparation, negotiation, syndication and execution of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any amendment, waiver, consent or other modification of the
provisions hereof and thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are consummated), and the consummation and administration of the transactions 
  165 





contemplated hereby and thereby, including all applicable Attorney Costs, (b) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any rights or remedies under this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents (including all such costs and expenses incurred during any workout or restructuring in respect of the Obligations and during any legal proceeding, including any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law), including all
applicable Attorney Costs, and (c) after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to pay or reimburse each Lender for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with any workout or restructuring in respect of the Obligations and during any legal proceeding,
including any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law, including all Attorney Costs. The foregoing costs and expenses shall include all search, filing, recording, title insurance and appraisal charges and fees related thereto, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee, as applicable, and the cost of independent public accountants and other outside experts
retained by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee, as applicable. All amounts due under this Section 12.04 shall be payable within ten Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall
survive the termination of the Facilities and repayment of all other Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 12.04 shall limit any right to reimbursement for expenses provided to the Collateral
Trustee pursuant to the terms of Collateral Trust Agreement.  12.05 Indemnification by the Borrower; Reimbursement by Lenders;
Waiver. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), the Collateral Trustee (and any sub-agent thereof), each Arranger, each
Lender and the L/C Issuer, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any outside counsel for any Indemnitee), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against
any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Borrower or any other Loan Party arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and
any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds
therefrom (including any refusal by the L/C Issuer to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or
alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any
actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower or any other Loan Party or any of the
Borrowers or such Loan Partys directors, shareholders or creditors or Affiliates, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, IN ALL CASES, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OUT OF THE
COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNITEE; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are
determined 
  166 





by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from a claim
brought by the Borrower or any other Loan Party against an Indemnitee for material breach of such Indemnitees obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower or such Loan Party has obtained a final and nonappealable
judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. In connection with any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement by more than one Indemnitee, all such Indemnitees shall be represented by the same
legal counsel selected by the Indemnitees; provided that if such legal counsel determines in good faith that representing all such Indemnitees is reasonably likely to result in a conflict of interest under Laws or ethical principles
applicable to such legal counsel or that a defense or counterclaim is available to an Indemnitee that is not available to all such Indemnitees, then to the extent reasonably necessary to avoid such a conflict of interest or to permit unqualified
assertion of such a defense or counterclaim, each Indemnitee shall be entitled to separate representation. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 12.05 shall limit any right to indemnity provided to the
Collateral Trustee pursuant to the terms of Collateral Trust Agreement.  To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to pay any
amount required under Section 12.04 or Section 12.05 to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the Collateral Trustee (or any sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent
thereof), the Collateral Trustee (or any sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders ratable share (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Collateral Trustee (or any such sub-agent) or the L/C Issuer in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of
any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Collateral Trustee (or any such sub-agent) or L/C Issuer in connection with such
capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.12(c). 
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, and acknowledges that no other Person
shall have, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any
other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to above shall be liable for any damages
arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  All amounts due under this Section 12.05 shall be payable within
ten (10) Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall survive after the resignation of the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Trustee, the replacement of any Lender and the payment in full of the
Obligations. This Section 12.05 shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim. 
  167 




12.06 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the
Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, the L/C
Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof
originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and the L/C Issuer
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate
per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under subsection (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the
termination of this Agreement.  12.07 Successors and Assigns. 
(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby, except that the Tribe and the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of their rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of
its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this
Section, (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section, or (iv) to an SPC in accordance with the provisions of subsection (g) of this Section (and
any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void ab initio). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement.  (b) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment(s) and the Loans (including for purposes of this Section 12.07(b), participations in L/C Obligations and in Swingline Loans) at the time owing to it under
any Facility); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 
  168 




(i) Minimum Amounts. 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment or Loans under any
Facility or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
(B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of any such Lenders
Commitment or Loans subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and
Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an
Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met; 
(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned (and any assignment of Revolving Commitments shall include the proportionate share of Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations, and
vice versa), except that this subsection (ii) shall not (A) apply to the Swingline Lenders rights and obligations in respect of Swingline Loans or (B) prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and
obligations among separate Commitments on a non-pro rata basis;  (iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be
required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:  (A)
Unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of an assignment, the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of a Revolving Commitment if
such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender with a Commitment in respect of the same Facility, an Affiliate of such a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such a Lender; provided that such consent shall be deemed to have been
given if the Borrower has not responded within ten Business Days after notice by the Administrative Agent;  (B) the
consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of a Revolving Commitment if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender with a Commitment or Loans in
respect of the same Facility, an Affiliate of such a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such a Lender; 
  169 




(C) the consent of the L/C Issuer (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment in respect of any Revolving Credit Facility; and  (D) the
consent of the Swingline Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment in respect of any Revolving Credit Facility. 
(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the
case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. 
(v) No Assignment to the Borrower or a Defaulting Lender. No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Borrower or
any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or to any of its Subsidiaries, or to any Person who, upon becoming a Lender, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this subsection
(B).  (vi) No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural person (or a holding
company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person).  (vii)
Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein,
the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or
subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each
of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender hereunder (and
interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Pro Rata Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be
a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
  170 




Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of
this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights
and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 12.04 and 12.05 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that except to the extent otherwise
expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Borrower (at
its expense) shall execute and deliver a Revolving Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 12.07(d). 
(c) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower,
shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts and stated
interest of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In addition, at any time that a request for a consent for a material or other substantive change to the Loan Documents is pending,
any Lender wishing to consult with other Lenders in connection therewith may request and receive from the Administrative Agent a copy of the Register. No assignment of a Loan, L/C Obligation or Commitment, whether or not evidenced by a Note, will be
effective without being recorded in the Register.  (d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or
the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower
or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the
Loans (including such Lenders participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swingline Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this

  171 





Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without
the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification that (i) reduces the fees, interest rate or principal payable directly or indirectly to such Participant (or such Lender in respect of such Participant), (ii)
increases the Commitment of such Participant (or such Lender in respect of such Participant) or (iii) extends the final maturity date for the Loans held by such Participant (or such Lender in respect of such Participant). Subject to subsection
(e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the
requirements under Section 3.01(d)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section; provided, however, that such
Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 12.16 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits
of Section 12.09 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. 
Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower,
maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant
Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any
commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in
registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as
Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (e) A Participant shall not be entitled to
receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent such
entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 3.01 unless such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.01(d) as though it were a Lender (it being understood that the documentation required under
Section 3.01(d) shall be delivered to the participating Lenders).  (f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or
assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;
provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. In the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in
bank loans, such Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, collaterally assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement, including the Loans and Notes or any other instrument evidencing its
rights as a Lender under this Agreement, to any holder of, trustee for, or any other representative of holders of, obligations owed or securities issued, by such fund, as security for such obligations or securities. 
  172 




(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a
Granting Lender) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an SPC) the option to provide
all or any part of any Revolving Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Revolving Loan, and
(ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Revolving Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Revolving Loan pursuant to the terms hereof or, if it fails to do so, to
make such payment to the Administrative Agent as is required under Section 2.12(c)(ii). Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase
the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 3.04), (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment
obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the
lender of record hereunder. The making of a Revolving Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Revolving Loan were made by such Granting Lender. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it
will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without prior consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and with the payment of a processing fee of $2,500 (which processing fee may be waived by the
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), assign all or any portion of its right to receive payment with respect to any Revolving Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any
non-public information relating to its funding of Revolving Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. 
(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Citizens Bank assigns all of its Revolving Commitment and Loans
pursuant to subsection (b) above, Citizens Bank may, upon 30 days notice to the Borrower and the Revolving Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer, other than with respect to Letters of Credit then outstanding. In the event of any such resignation
as L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Revolving Lenders (or, if no Revolving Lender acceptable to the Borrower in its sole discretion shall agree to serve such role, any other Person reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent) a successor L/C Issuer hereunder (with such Revolving Lenders or other Persons consent); provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of
Citizens Bank as L/C Issuer with respect to the issuance of future Letters of Credit. If Citizens Bank resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder

  173 





with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the
Revolving Lenders to make Base Rate Revolving Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer, (a) such successor shall succeed to
and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer, (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letter of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such
succession or make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Citizens Bank to effectively assume the obligations of Citizens Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank of America, N.A. assigns all of its Revolving Commitment and
Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Bank of America, N.A. may, upon 30 days notice to the Borrower and the Revolving Lenders, resign as Swingline Lender. In the event of any such resignation as Swingline Lender, the Borrower shall be
entitled to appoint from among the Revolving Lenders (with such appointed Revolving Lenders consent) a successor Swingline Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall
affect the resignation of Bank of America, N.A. as Swingline Lender. If Bank of America, N.A. resigns as Swingline Lender, it shall retain all the rights and obligations of the Swingline Lender hereunder with respect to all Swingline Loans
outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as Swingline Lender (including the right to require the Revolving Lenders to make Base Rate Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c)). Upon the appointment of a
successor Swingline Lender, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Swingline Lender and (b) the successor Swingline Lender shall enter into a new
agreement in substitution of the Autoborrow Agreement, the Autoborrow Agreement shall terminate and all Swingline Loans shall be repaid in full together with all interest and fees owing in connection therewith. 
12.08 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as
defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates respective auditors, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors, service providers and representatives that need
to know such information (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by
any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena
or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant
in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (ii) any pledgee referred to in Section 12.07(f), or (iii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction
relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section, (y) becomes available to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a 
  174 





source other than the Borrower or (z) to the extent such information is independently developed by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Trustee, any Arranger, any Lender, any L/C Issuer
or any of their respective Affiliates. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending
industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Commitments. For purposes of this Section, Information means all
information received from the Tribe, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries relating to the Tribe, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is
available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure to any such Person by the Tribe, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of
Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.  12.09 Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the
Lenders provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, after obtaining the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice
to the Borrower or any other Loan Party, any such notice being waived by the Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of each Loan Party) to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender hereunder or under
any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or
unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and
application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. 
12.10 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to
be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (other than Tribal Laws) (the Maximum Rate). If the Administrative
Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the
interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee,
or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the
Obligations hereunder. 
  175 




12.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery by facsimile or other electronic transmission of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement and each other Loan
Document shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement and such other Loan Document. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee may also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by
facsimile or other electronic transmission be confirmed by a manually signed original thereof; provided that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by facsimile or
other electronic transmission.  12.12 Integration. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the complete
and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any
other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict
with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof. 
12.13 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan
Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default
at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding. 
12.14 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid, void or
unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations
to replace the illegal, invalid, void or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid, void or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a
particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  12.15 [Reserved].
 12.16 Replacement of Lenders. If the Borrower is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant to the provisions of
Section 3.06, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative
Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 12.07), all of its interests, rights (other than its
existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a
Lender accepts such assignment), provided that: 
  176 




(a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment
fee (if any) specified in Section 12.07(b);  (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an
amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under
Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
(c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or
payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
(d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and 
(e) in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting
Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such
assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Neither the consent nor signature of an applicable
Lender shall be required in connection with the provisions of this Section and any assignment pursuant hereto may be deemed effective by the Borrower, if the applicable Lender has not executed the applicable Assignment and Assumption within three
(3) Business Days of its receipt of the Borrowers written request therefor.  12.17 Governing Law. Except to the
extent otherwise expressly provided therein, each Loan Document shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the Law of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law principles that would result in the application
of any Law other than the Law of the State of New York (other than any mandatory provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York relating to the Law governing perfection and the effect of perfection of the security interests
granted under the Loan Documents), provided however, that if and only to the extent that any security interest granted to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall be deemed exempt from the provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York by virtue of the Borrower being a governmental entity, then such security interest shall be governed by the corresponding
provisions of Article 9 of the Tribes Uniform Commercial Code, as adopted by the UCC Ordinance. The Borrower and each other party hereto each hereby consents to the application of New York civil law to the construction, interpretation and
enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to the application of New York civil law to the procedural aspects of any suit, action or 
  177 





proceeding relating thereto, including but not limited to legal process, execution of judgments and other legal remedies, except for any procedural matters governed by or relating to the conduct
of arbitration under Section 12.18. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which Borrower is a party are each Contracts of the Tribal Gaming Authority within the meaning of Section 1 of Article XIII
(entitled Tribal Gaming Authority Amendment) of the Constitution.  12.18 Arbitration Reference. 
(a) Mandatory Arbitration. Subject to clause (c) below, at the option of the Administrative Agent (exercised in
accordance with consent of the Required Lenders), the Borrower, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are Tribal Entities or, to the extent it is a party to any such controversy or claim, the Tribe, any controversy or claim between or among the
parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any agreements or instruments relating hereto or thereto or delivered in connection herewith or therewith and any claim based on or arising from an alleged tort in
connection herewith or therewith (each, a Claim), shall be determined by arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the United States Arbitration Act (Title 9, U.S. Code), notwithstanding any choice of law
provision in this Agreement, and under the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitrators shall give effect to statutes of limitation in determining any claim. Any controversy concerning whether an
issue is arbitrable shall be determined by the arbitrators. Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction and each of the Tribe, the Borrower and each Restricted Subsidiary consents to the jurisdiction of the
state and federal courts located in any jurisdiction in which are located assets against which such judgment is sought to be enforced. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy
shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if any other party contests such action for judicial relief. 
(b) Provisional Remedies, Self-Help and Foreclosure. No provision of this Section shall limit the right of any party to
this Agreement to exercise self-help remedies such as setoff, to foreclose against or sell any real or personal property collateral or security or to obtain provisional or ancillary remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction before, after, or
during the pendency of any arbitration or other proceeding. The exercise of a remedy does not waive the right of any party to resort to arbitration or reference. At the Required Lenders option, foreclosure under a deed of trust or mortgage may
be accomplished either by exercise of power of sale under the deed of trust or mortgage or by judicial foreclosure.  (c)
Limitation.  (i) This Section shall not be construed to require arbitration by the Secured Parties of any disputes
which now exist or hereafter arise amongst themselves which do not involve the Tribe, the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries and are not related to this Agreement and the Loan Documents. 
  178 




(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any Loan
Document, a Claim may only be submitted to or otherwise determined by arbitration pursuant to clause (a) or otherwise if, and only if, each of the courts described in Section 12.20(c)(i) and 12.20(c)(ii) lack or
decline jurisdiction with respect to such Claim.  (d) Specific Enforcement Representation. Each party to this
Agreement severally represents and warrants to the other parties that this Section 12.18 is specifically enforceable against such party by the other parties. 
12.19 Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY

arbitration in any forum, with respect to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, provided that (1) the waiver contained in this clause (a) is expressly limited to actions against

sovereign immunity (applicable to itself as an Indian tribal nation) (and any defense based thereon) from any suit, action or proceeding or from any legal process (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution, exercise of contempt powers, or otherwise) with respect to the representations and warranties of the Tribe set forth in Article V, the covenants of the Tribe set forth in Article VII, and each provision of

any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law, and each of the Tribe, the Borrower and each Restricted Subsidiary consents to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in any jurisdiction in which are located assets against
which such judgment is sought to be enforced. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents against the Tribe, the Borrower, the Restricted Subsidiaries or their respective properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. 
(d) Each of the Tribe, the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries hereby expressly and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents in any court described in clause
(c) above. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

for the entry of judgment on and/or enforcement of an arbitration award or court order or judgment may be brought in the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Disputes Court. Each of the Tribe, the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries expressly waives the
application of the doctrines of exhaustion of tribal remedies and any right of comity with respect to any Tribal Court or any tribal court of appeals the Tribe may now or hereafter maintain. In any event, no action may be brought in any Tribal Court
without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Required Lenders).  12.21 Lender
Covenant. In any action or proceeding against Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to enforce the Loan Documents which is not also an action or proceeding against the Tribe, the Secured Parties agree that they shall have no recourse to
the Tribe or to its property which is not Authority Property. In any action or proceeding to enforce the Loan Documents which includes the Tribe, the Secured Parties agree that they shall, to the extent then permitted by applicable Law (other than
Tribal Law), take commercially practicable steps to enforce any claim for damages awarded to the Secured Parties by any court, tribunal, arbitrator or other decision maker against Borrower or the Authority Property prior to taking recourse to the
Tribe or any Property thereof which is not Authority Property. The provisions of this Section shall not be construed (a) to create any recourse on the part of the Secured Parties against the Tribe, the property of the Tribe which is not
