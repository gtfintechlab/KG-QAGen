or to fund or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Advances hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders and the Company, whereupon (A) such Lender shall have no obligation to make Eurocurrency Rate

(consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a designation would avoid the need for such suspension and conversion and would not, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender, (x) any request by a Borrower for Eurocurrency Rate Advances during a time when a Lenders obligation to make, or convert Revolving Credit Advances into,
Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended hereunder shall be deemed to be a request for, or for conversion into, Base Rate Advances from such Lender, (y) all Revolving Credit Advances that would otherwise be made by such Lender as
Eurocurrency Rate Advances during any such suspension shall instead be made as Base Rate Advances and (z) in the event any Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Company of the occurrence of the circumstances causing such
suspension under this Section 2.02(c), all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurocurrency Rate Advances that would have been made by such Lender or the converted Eurocurrency Rate Advances

  22 


(ii) if the Administrative Agent cannot furnish the Eurocurrency Rate for any
Revolving Credit Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances because of conditions existing in the London interbank market, the right of the Borrowers to select Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent
shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist;  (iii) if the
Required Lenders shall, at least one Business Day before the date of any requested Eurocurrency Rate Advance, notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurocurrency Rate for any Interest Period will not adequately reflect the cost to the Required
Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurocurrency Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the Company and the Lenders, whereupon the Lenders shall have no obligation to make,
or convert Revolving Credit Advances into, Eurocurrency Rate Advances until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist; and 
(iv) if any Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of
any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender to perform its obligations hereunder to make Advances or to fund or maintain Advances hereunder to such
Designated Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Company, whereupon such Lender shall have no obligation to make Advances to such Designated Borrower, until such Lender notifies the Company and the
Administrative Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.  (d) Effect of Failure to Fulfill Conditions.
Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Company and the relevant Designated Borrower. In the case of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate
Advances, the relevant Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable
conditions set forth in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding anticipated profits), cost or expense reasonably incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to
fund the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date, such indemnity to be paid promptly upon receipt by the relevant Borrower of a certificate
of such Lender setting forth the calculation of the amount of the indemnity claimed by such Lender.  (e) Funds Available. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders ratable
portion of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable

  23 



portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the relevant Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together
with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the relevant Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the relevant Borrower, the interest rate applicable
at the time to Revolving Credit Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall
constitute such Lenders Revolving Credit Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.  (f) Failure to Make
Advances. The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by it as part of any Revolving Credit Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Advance on
the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing.

interest is payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate for any Advance hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
(d) Business Days. Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such
payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment fee, as the case may be; provided that if such extension would cause payment
of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. 
(e) Assumption of Payment. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative
Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender
repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate (if such Advance is denominated in Dollars) or at the cost of funds incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Sub-Agent, as
applicable (if such Advance is denominated in an Alternate Currency).  (f) Rate Information. The Reference Bank shall notify the
Company and the Administrative Agent of the Base Rate in effect on the first Business Day on which a Base Rate Advance is outstanding and each day on which a change in the Base Rate occurs, each in sufficient detail to enable the Company to
calculate interest payments hereunder with respect to Base Rate Advances, and shall provide such information to any Lender promptly upon its request. The Company will provide to the Administrative Agent (i) promptly upon receipt thereof copies
of the information received by the Company pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence or any Rate Notification received pursuant to Section 2.02(a), (ii) promptly 
  30 



upon the making of any interest payment with respect to a Base Rate Advance hereunder a schedule based on such information setting forth the Base Rate for each day in the period in which such
Advance was outstanding, and (iii) promptly upon obtaining knowledge thereof, notice of any change in the rating assigned by Standard & Poors, Moodys, or Fitch to the Companys Long-Term Indebtedness and the date of
such change, provided that the Companys failure to provide any of the foregoing information shall be deemed not to be a Default or an Event of Default hereunder. 
(g) Currency of Payments. All payments of principal of and interest on, and any amounts payable under Section 2.06 in respect of,
an Advance that is denominated in a particular Currency shall be made in such Currency, and all other amounts payable under this Agreement (except as specified in Section 9.06) shall be paid in Dollars. 
SECTION 2.10 Taxes. (a) General. Any and all payments by each Loan Party hereunder or under the Notes shall be made in
accordance with Section 2.09, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto (which are, with respect to payments by the Company
only, and with respect to United States withholding tax, not in effect or not imposed on the date of this Agreement); excluding, in the case of each Lender and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed
on it by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes
imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Lenders Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof, and any U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed under FATCA (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges,
withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as Taxes).  (b) Other Taxes. In addition, each Loan
Party agrees to pay any stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with
respect to, this Agreement not in effect or not imposed on the date of this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as Other Taxes) upon notice from the Lender. 
(c) Tax Indemnity. Each Loan Party will indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes
(including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.10) paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties,
interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative
Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.  (d) Receipt. Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes,
each Loan Party will furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. 
  31 


SECTION 2.11 Promissory Notes. Any Lender may request that Advances of any Type made
by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the relevant Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns)
substantially in the form of Exhibit E (a Note) in the case of the Advances. Thereafter, such Advances evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to
Section 8.07) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). 
SECTION 2.12 Use of Proceeds of Advances. Each Borrower will use the proceeds of the Advances solely for general corporate
purposes, including, without limitation, for the acquisition of the Newell Tools business.  SECTION 2.13 Defaulting Lenders.
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent shall deliver written notice to such effect upon obtaining knowledge of such event to the Company and such
Defaulting Lender, and the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:  (i) any
payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of any Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VI or otherwise) shall be
applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata
basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, as the Company may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Advance in respect of which that Defaulting
Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or Swing Line Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to
the payment of any amounts owing to any Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by such Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under
this Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Advance in respect of which such
Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Advances were made at a time when the applicable conditions set forth in Article III were satisfied or wai

reunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a
Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation. To the extent that the reallocation described
above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable law, prepay outstanding Swing Line Advances in an amount equal to the Swing Line
Lenders Fronting Exposure.  (b) No Revolving Credit Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise affected, and, except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Section 2.13, performance by the Borrowers of their obligations shall not be excused or otherwise modified as a result of the operation of this Section 2.13. The rights and remedies against a Defaulting
Lender under this Section 2.13 are in addition to any other rights and remedies which the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender. 
(c) If the Company, each Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent agree in writing in their reasonable determination that a Defaulting
Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include
arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Revolving Credit Advances of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may
determine to be necessary to cause such Revolving Credit Advances and funded and unfunded participations in Swing Line Advances to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their pro rata share, whereupon such Lender will cease
to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further,
that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lenders having been a
Defaulting Lender.  (d) New Swing Line Advances. So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Swing Line Lender shall be
required to fund any Swing Line Advances unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swing Line Advance. 
  33

from time to time, upon not less than 15 Business Days notice to the Administrative Agent and the Sub-Agent, designate one or more Subsidiaries organized in any of the jurisdictions listed on Schedule II
or, subject to the final two paragraphs of this clause (a) below, any other jurisdiction, as Borrowers hereunder. Upon any such designation of a Subsidiary and the Administrative Agents receipt of each of the following

to make Borrowings on and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement:  (i) Executed Counterparts. A

Business Days before the date on which such Subsidiary is to become a Designated Borrower;  (ii) Opinion of Counsel to
the Designated Borrower. A favorable written opinion (addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and dated the date of the Designation Letter) of reputable counsel to such Designated Borrower (which may be internal counsel) in the
relevant jurisdiction (and such Designated Borrower hereby and by delivery of such Designation Letter instruct such counsel to deliver such opinion to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent), as to the due organization of such Designated Borrower
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, the due authorization, execution and delivery by such Designated Borrower of such Designation Letter and of the making of Borrowings by it hereunder, the obtaining of all licenses, approvals and
consents of, and the making of all filings and registrations with, any applicable Governmental Authority required in connection therewith and the legality, validity and binding effect and enforceability thereof, and such other legal matters relating
thereto as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request;  (iii) Corporate Documents. Such documents and
certificates as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request (including without limitation certified copies of the charter and by-laws of such Designated Borrower and of resolutions of its Board of
Directors authorizing such Designated Borrowers acceptance of the Companys designation as a Designated Borrower and its becoming a Borrower under this Agreement, and of all documents evidencing all other necessary corporate

(vi) Other Items. Such other documents relating thereto as the
Administrative Agent or any Lender or special New York counsel to the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, including any documentation and other evidence which may be requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to comply with and/or
administer any know your customer or other customer identification related policies and procedures required under applicable laws and regulations. 
If the Company shall designate as a Designated Borrower hereunder any Subsidiary not organized under the laws of the United States or any
State thereof, any Lender may, with notice to the Administrative Agent and the Company, fulfill its Commitment by causing an Affiliate or branch of such Lender to act as the Lender in respect of such Designated Borrower. 
As soon as practicable after receiving notice from the Company or the Administrative Agent of the Companys intent to designate a
Subsidiary as a Designated Borrower, and in any event no later than five Business Days after the delivery of such notice, for a Designated Borrower that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than of the United States or a political
subdivision thereof or a jurisdiction listed on Schedule II, any Lender that (x) may not legally lend to, establish credit for the account of and/or do any business whatsoever with such Designated Borrower directly or through an Affiliate
of such Lender as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph or (y) reasonably determines that it would incur additional expenses (including taxes) by lending to such foreign Borrower (a Protesting Lender) shall so
notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing. With respect to each Protesting Lender, the Company shall, effective on or before the date that such Designated Borrower shall have the right to borrow hereunder, either (A) notify the
Administrative Agent and such Protesting Lender that the Commitments of such Protesting Lender shall be terminated; provided that such Protesting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its

Any Termination Letter furnished hereunder shall be effective
upon receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly so notify the Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of a Termination Letter with respect to any Designated Borrower shall not terminate (i) any obligation of
such Borrower that remains unpaid at the time of such delivery (including without limitation any obligation arising thereafter in respect of such Borrower under Section 2.08 or Section 2.10) or (ii) the obligations of the Company
under Article IX with respect to any unpaid obligations of such Borrower.

Section 2.15 and in each other provision of this Agreement to which reference is made in this Section 2.15 (whether expressly or impliedly), the following terms have the meanings given to them in this
Section 2.15:  EMU shall mean economic and monetary union as contemplated in the
Treaty on European Union.  EMU Legislation shall mean legislative measures of the European Council for
the introduction of, changeover to or operation of a single or unified European currency, being in part the implementation of the third stage of EMU. 
Euro shall mean the single currency of Participating Member States of the European Union. 
Participating Member State shall mean each state so described in any EMU Legislation. 
Treaty on European Union shall mean the Treaty of Rome of March 25, 1957, as amended by the Single
European Act 1986 and the Maastricht Treaty (which was signed at Maastricht on February 7, 1992, and came into force on November 1, 1993), as amended from time to time. 
(b) Payments by the Administrative Agent Generally. With respect to the payment of any amount denominated in the Euro, the
Administrative Agent shall not be liable to the Company or any of the Lenders in any way whatsoever for any delay, or the consequences of any delay, in the crediting to any account of any amount required by this Agreement to be paid by the
Administrative Agent if the Administrative Agent shall have taken all relevant steps to achieve, on the date required by this Agreement, the payment of such amount in immediately available, freely transferable, cleared funds to the account of the
Company or any Lender, as the case may be, in the Principal Financial Center in the Participating Member State which the Company or, as the case may be, such Lender shall have specified for such purpose. In this paragraph (b), all
relevant steps shall mean all such steps as may be prescribed from time to time by the regulations or operating procedures of such clearing or settlement system as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably determine for the
purpose of clearing or settling payments of the Euro.  (c) Determination of Eurocurrency Rate. For the purposes of determining the
date on which the applicable rate for Eurocurrency Rate Advances is determined under this Agreement for any Advance denominated in the Euro for any Interest Period therefor, references in this Agreement to London Banking Days shall be deemed to be
references to Target Days.  (d) Determination of Overnight Rate. If requested by the
Sub-Agent, each Swing Line Lender agrees to furnish to the Sub-Agent timely information for the purpose of determining the Overnight Rate. If any one or more of the
Swing Line Lenders shall not furnish such timely information to the Administrative Agent for the purpose of determining any such interest rate, the Sub-Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of
timely information furnished by the remaining Swing Line Lenders. The Sub-Agent shall give prompt notice to the 
  36 



Borrower and the Swing Line Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Sub-Agent for purposes of Section 2.05(b) (it being understood
that the Sub-Agent shall not be required to disclose to any party hereto any information regarding any Swing Line Lender or any rate provided by such Swing Line Lender in accordance with the definition of
Overnight Rate, including, without limitation, whether a Swing Line Lender has provided a rate or the rate provided by any individual Swing Line Lender). 
SECTION 2.16 The Swing Line Advances. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Swing Line Lender severally
agrees to make a portion of the credit otherwise available from time to time to the Borrowers by making swing line ad

 funds, before 1:00 P.M. (London time) on the date a Borrower has requested such Swing Line Advance. After the Sub-Agents receipt of such
funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 3.02, the Sub-Agent will make such funds available to such Borrower by transferring the amount thereof to
the account designated by such Borrower for such purpose on the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing. 
  37 


(c) The failure of any Swing Line Lender to make the Swing Line Advance to be made by it as part
of any Swing Line Borrowing shall not relieve any other Swing Line Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Swing Line Advance on the date of such Swing Line Borrowing, but no Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for the failure of
any other Swing Line Lender to make the Swing Line Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Swing Line Borrowing.  (d)
Upon written demand by a Swing Line Lender, with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent, each other Lender will purchase from such Swing Line Lender, and such Swing Line Lender shall sell and assign to each such other Lender, such other
Lenders Pro Rata Share of such outstanding Swing Line Advance, by making available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Swing Line Lender, by deposit to the Administrative
Agents Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Swing Line Advance to be purchased by such Lender. Each Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale and assignment. Each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees, promptly upon receipt of such notice from the Administrative Agent, to purchase its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding Swing Line Advance on the third Business Day after the date demand therefor. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swing Line Advances pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance
of a Default or Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Upon any such assignment by any Swing Line Lender to any
other Lender of a portion of a Swing Line Advance, such Swing Line Lender represents and warrants to such other Lender that such Swing Line Lender is the legal and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, but makes no other
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to such Swing Line Advance, this Agreement, the Notes or the Borrowers. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Swing Line Advance available
to the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such Lender is required to have made such amount available to the
Administrative Agent until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the higher of the Overnight Rate and the cost of funds incurred by the Administrative Agent in respect of such amount, plus any administrative, processing or
similar fees customarily charge by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such amount for the account of such Swing Line Lender on any Business Day, such amount so paid in
respect of principal shall constitute a Swing Line Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Swing Line Advance made by such Swing Line Lender shall be reduced by
such amount on such Business Day.  (e) At any time after any Lender has funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Advance, if any Swing
Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Advance, such Swing Line Lender will promptly distribute to such Lender its ratable share thereof in the same funds as those received by such Swing Line Lender.

ARTICLE VII  THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT  SECTION 7.01 Appointment and Authority. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints Citibank to act on
its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms
hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article (other than the provisions of Section 7.07) are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, and neither the Company nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any
other 
  49 



similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.
Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
SECTION 7.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in
its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise
requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory
capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 
SECTION 7.03 Exculpatory Provisions. (a) The Administrative Agents duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are
solely ministerial and administrative in nature and the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent:  (i) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default
or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;  (ii) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or
exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel,
may expose the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any bankruptcy
or other debtor relief law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any bankruptcy or other debtor relief law; 
(iii) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not
be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. 
  50 


(b) The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
(i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as
provided in Sections 8.01 or 8.03) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or the event or events that give
or may give rise to any Default or Event of Default unless and until the Company or any Lender shall have given notice to the Administrative Agent in writing describing such Default or Event of Default and such event or events. 
(c) The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any
statement, warranty, representation or other information made or supplied in or in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or the Information Memorandum, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered
hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith or the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the information contained therein, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or
conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or (v) the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Article 3 or elsewhere herein, other than (but subject to the foregoing clause (ii)) to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. 
(d) Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall require the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties to carry out any
know your customer or other checks in relation to any Person on behalf of any Lender and each Lender confirms to the Administrative Agent that it is solely responsible for any such checks it is required to carry out and that it may not
rely on any statement in relation to such checks made by the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties.  SECTION 7.04
Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing
(including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon
any statement made to it orally or by email and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Borrowing that by
its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless an officer of the Administrative Agent responsible for the transactions contemplated hereby
shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan, and such Lender shall not have made available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders ratable portion of such Borrowing. The Administrative Agent
may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company or any other Loan Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of
any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
  51 


SECTION 7.05 Indemnification. The Lenders severally agree to indemnify the
Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company), ratably according to their Revolving Credit Commitments, as then or most recently in effect, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement
and the Notes, or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the Notes, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the Administrative Agents gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket
expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of,
or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Company. 
SECTION 7.06 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and
powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. Each such sub-agent and the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and each such sub-agent shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article 7 and Section 8.04 (as though such
sub-agents were the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any sub-agents affecting any of the other Lenders except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted
with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub agents.  SECTION 7.07 Resignation of Administrative
Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Company. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to
appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in New York, and which successor shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. If no such successor shall have been so appointed
by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Resignation
Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation
shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. 
  52 


(b) If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to
clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Company and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and appoint a successor, which shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Company. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the
Removal Effective Date), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. 
(c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all
payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent
as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed
Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations as Administrative
Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the
retiring or removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 8.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed
Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. 
(d) Any resignation pursuant to this Section by a Person acting as Administrative Agent shall, unless such Person shall notify the Borrowers
and the Lenders otherwise, also act to relieve such Person and its Affiliates of any obligation to advance Swing Line Advances where such advance is to occur on or after the effective date of such resignation. Upon the acceptance of a
successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Swing Line Lender, (ii) the retiring Swing Line
Lender shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, (iii) the successor Swing Line Lender shall enter into an Assignment and Acceptance and acquire from the retiring Swing Line Lender
each outstanding Swing Line Advance of such retiring Swing Line Lender for a purchase price equal to par plus accrued interest. 
SECTION 7.08 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Parties. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it
shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
  53 


SECTION 7.09 Sub-Agent. The Sub-Agent has been designated under this Agreement to carry out the duties of the Administrative Agent. The Sub-Agent shall be subject to each of the obligations in this
Agreement to be performed by the Sub-Agent, and each of the Borrowers and the Lenders agrees that the Sub-Agent shall be entitled to exercise each of the rights and
shall be entitled to each of the benefits of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement as such rights and benefits relate to the performance of its obligations hereunder. 
SECTION 7.10 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Persons acting as Bookrunners,
Lead Arrangers or Syndication Agent listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, the Sub-Agent or as a Lender hereunder.  ARTICLE VIII 
MISCELLANEOUS 
SECTION 8.01 Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, nor consent to
any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Company and the relevant other Loan Party, if applicable, and the Required Lenders, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided that (a) the written consent of the Company and each Lender directly affected thereby shall be required in order to amend or waive
any provision of the Agreement or the Notes which would have the effect of (i) a reduction in principal, interest or fees payable to such Lender under this Agreement or the Notes, (ii) the postponement of any date fixed for the payment of
any principal, interest or fees under this Agreement or the Notes, (iii) an increase in the Commitments or (iv) amending or waiving compliance with Section 2.08 or Section 2.14; (b) the written
consent of the Company and all the Lenders shall be required in order to amend or waive any provision of the Agreement or the Notes which would have the effect of (i) amending or waiving compliance with the proviso to
Section 2.01(a), Section 8.05 or this Section 8.01, (ii) amending the definition of Required Lenders or (iii) any release or modification of the Companys guarantee under
Article IX; (c) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative
Agent under this Agreement, and (d) the Commitment of any Lender shall not be extended without the prior written consent of such Lender; provided further no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by the applicable Swing Line Lender in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or duties of such Swing Line Lender under this Agreement; and provided further that the Agreement may be
amended to adjust the borrowing mechanics related to Swing Line Advances with only the written consent the Company, the Administrative Agent, the Sub-Agent, and the Swing Line Lenders if the obligations of the Lenders are not adversely affected
thereby.

Electronic Platform and its primary web portal are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and policies implemented or modified by the Administrative Agent from time to time (including, as of the Closing Date, a dual firewall and a
User ID/Password Authorization System) and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a single-user-per-deal authorization method whereby each user may access
the Approved Electronic Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the Lenders and each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that the distribution of material through
an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution. In consideration for the convenience and other benefits afforded by such distribution and for the other
consideration provided hereunder, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, each of the Lenders and each Loan Party hereby approves distribution of the Approved Electronic Communications through the Approved Electronic Platform
and understands and assumes the risks of such distribution. 
  56 


(c) (i) THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC P

NIC COMMUNICATIONS ARE
PROVIDED AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE. NONE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY OF ITS RELATED PARTIES WARRANTS THE ACCURACY, ADEQUACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND
EACH EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM EXCEPT FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT OR ANY OF ITS RELATED PARTIES. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT
OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY OF ITS RELATED PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM. 
(ii) Each of the Lenders and each Loan Party agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but (except as may be required by applicable law) shall
not be obligated to, store the Approved Electronic Communications on the Approved Electronic Platform in accordance with the Administrative Agents generally-applicable document retention procedures and policies. 
(d) Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as
defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates respective managers, administrators, trustees, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other
representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any
regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it or its Affiliates (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations
or by any subpoena or similar legal process or in connection with assignments or pledges made in accordance with Section 8.08(c), (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies

eement containing provisions substantially the same as those of
this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective party and direct or indirect counterparty (or
its managers, administrators, trustees, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to the Company and its
obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder or other credit insurance 
  57 



provider relating to the Company and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (iii) any rating agency, or (iv) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar organization,
(g) with the consent of the Company or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or
any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market
data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Commitments. 
For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, provided that, in the case of information received from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required
to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.  (e) Treatment of Information. (i) Certain of the
Lenders may enter into this Agreement and take or not take action hereunder or under the other Loan Documents on the basis of information that does not contain material non-public information with respect to
any of the Loan Parties or their securities (Restricting Information). Other Lenders may enter into this Agreement and take or not take action hereunder or under the other Loan Documents on the basis of information that may
contain Restricting Information. Each Lender acknowledges that United States federal and state securities laws prohibit any person from purchasing or selling securities on the basis of material, non-public
information concerning the issuer of such securities or, subject to certain limited exceptions, from communicating such information to any other Person. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall, by making any
Communications (including Restricting Information) available to a Lender, by participating in any conversations or other interactions with a Lender or otherwise, make or be deemed to make any statement with regard to or otherwise warrant that any
such information or Communication does or does not contain Restricting Information nor shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties be responsible or liable in any way for any decision a Lender may make to limit or to not limit its
access to Restricting Information. In particular, none of the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (i) shall have, and the Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself and each of its Related Parties, hereby disclaims, any duty to
ascertain or inquire as to whether or not a Lender has or has not limited its access to Restricting Information, such Lenders policies or procedures regarding the safeguarding of material, nonpublic information or such Lenders compliance
with applicable laws related thereto or (ii) shall have, or incur, any liability to any Loan Party or Lender or any of their respective Related Parties arising out of or relating to the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties
providing or not providing Restricting Information to any Lender. 
  58 


(ii) Each Loan Party agrees that (i) all Communications it provides to the Administrative
Agent intended for delivery to the Lenders whether by posting to the Approved Electronic Platform or otherwise shall be clearly and conspicuously marked PUBLIC if such Communications do not contain Restricting Information which, at a
minimum, shall mean that the word PUBLIC shall appear prominently on the first page thereof, (ii) by marking Communications PUBLIC, each Loan Party shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders to treat such Communications as either publicly available information or not material information (although, in this latter case, such Communications may contain sensitive business information and, therefore, remain subject to the
confidentiality undertakings of Section 8.02(c)) with respect to such Loan Party or its securities for purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws, (iii) all Communications marked PUBLIC may be delivered to all
Lenders and may be made available through a portion of the Approved Electronic Platform designated Public Side Information, and (iv) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to treat any Communications that are not marked
PUBLIC as Restricting Information and may post such Communications to a portion of the Approved Electronic Platform not designated Public Side Information. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Affiliates shall be
responsible for any statement or other designation by a Loan Party regarding whether a Communication contains or does not contain material non-public information with respect to any of the Loan Parties or
their securities nor shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates incur any liability to any Loan Party, any Lender or any other Person for any action taken by the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates based upon such statement or
designation, including any action as a result of which Restricting Information is provided to a Lender that may decide not to take access to Restricting Information. Nothing in this clause (ii) shall modify or limit a Lenders
obligations under Section 8.02(b) with regard to Communications and the maintenance of the confidentiality of or other treatment of Information. 
(iii) Each Lender acknowledges that circumstances may arise that require it to refer to Communications that might contain Restricting
Information. Accordingly, each Lender agrees that it will nominate at least one designee to receive Communications (including Restricting Information) on its behalf and identify such designee (including such designees contact information) on
such Lenders Administrative Questionnaire. Each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time of such Lenders designees e-mail address to which notice of the availability
of Restricting Information may be sent by electronic transmission.  (iv) Each Lender acknowledges that Communications delivered hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents may contain Restricting Information and that such Communications are available to all Lenders generally. Each Lender that elects not to take access to Restricting Information does so voluntarily and, by such
election, acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and other Lenders may have access to Restricting Information that is not available to such electing Lender. None of the Administrative Agent or any Lender with access to Restricting
Information shall have any duty to disclose such Restricting Information to such electing Lender or to use such Restricting Information on behalf of such electing Lender, and shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, such
Restricting Information. 
  59 


(v) The provisions of the foregoing clauses of this subsection (d) are designed to
assist the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Loan Parties, in complying with their respective contractual obligations and applicable law in circumstances where certain Lenders express a desire not to receive Restricting Information
notwithstanding that certain Communications hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or other information provided to the Lenders hereunder or thereunder may contain Restricting Information. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related
Parties warrants or makes any other statement with respect to the adequacy of such provisions to achieve such purpose nor does the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties warrant or make any other statement to the effect that any Loan
Partys or Lenders adherence to such provisions will be sufficient to ensure compliance by such Loan Party or Lender with its contractual obligations or its duties under applicable law in respect of Restricting Information and each of the
Lenders and each Loan Party assumes the risks associated therewith.  SECTION 8.03 No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part
of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. 
SECTION 8.04 Costs and Expenses; Breakage Indemnification. (a) The Company agrees to pay on demand all reasonable costs and
expenses, if any (including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses), of (i) the Administrative Agent in connection with the negotiation, syndication, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the
other documents delivered hereunder and (ii) the Administrative Agent and each Lender in connection with enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents to be
delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses in connection with the enforcement of rights under this Section 8.04(a). 
(b) If any payment, prepayment or conversion of any Eurocurrency Rate Advance is made by the Company or a Designated Borrower, as applicable,
to or for the account of a Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result of acceleration of the maturity of the Advances and the Notes pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any other reason, such Borrower
shall, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses
which it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund or maintain such
Advance.  (c) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender and each of their Related Parties
(each, an Indemnified Party) from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against
any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of, or in connection with the preparation for a defense of, any investigation, litigation or 
  60 



proceeding arising out of, related to or in connection with the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances, including in connection with any acquisition or proposed acquisition by the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company of another Person or one or more businesses of another Person (whether by means of a stock purchase, asset acquisition or otherwise), whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by
the Company, its directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party

nded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such
Lenders ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lenders required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Company agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation or subparticipation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 8.05 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation or subparticipation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Company in the amount of such participation or subparticipation.
 SECTION 8.06 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, each Designated
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Loan Party shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder or under any Note or any interest herein or therein (other
than as permitted by Section 5.02(b)) without the prior written consent of all of the Lenders. 
  61 


SECTION 8.07 Successors and Assigns. (a) Successors and Assigns Generally. No
Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the
provisions of paragraph (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of paragraph (e) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any
party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent
provided in paragraph (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.  (b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment and the Revolving Credit Advances at the time owing to it and/or all or a portion of its Swing Line Commitment and the Swing Line Advances at
the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:  (i) Minimum
Amounts.  (A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment(s)
and/or the Advances at the time owing to it or contemporaneous assignments that equal at least the amount specified in paragraph (b)(i)(B) of this Section in the aggregate or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of
a Lender, no minimum amount need be assigned; and  (B) in any case not described in paragraph (b)(i)(A) of this
Section, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment and/or Swing Line Commitment (which for this purpose includes Advances outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance
of the Advances of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is
specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 
(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Advance or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and
obligations among separate facilities on a non-pro rata basis. 
  62 


(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment
except to the extent required by paragraph (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:  (A) the consent of
the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment, or (y) such assignment is to an Affiliate of such Lender;
provided that the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten Business Days after having received notice thereof; and 
(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for
assignments in respect of any Commitments or Advances if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender or an Affiliate of such Lender; and 
(C) the consent of each Swing Line Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any
assignment in respect of the Revolving Credit Commitments.  (iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such
processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. 
(v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Company or any of the
Companys Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B). 
(vi) No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural Person. 
(vii) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender
hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount
sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent, the
applicable pro rata share of Advances previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities

  63 



then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata
share of all Advances and participations in and Swing Line Advances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without
compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the
assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.08 and 8.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to
the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder
arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a
sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section.  (c)
Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 8.02 a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Advances owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). In
addition, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt written notice to the Company of its receipt and recording of any Assignment and Assumption. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Loan Parties, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company
and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  (d) Participations. Any Lender may at
any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Company or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person or the Company or any of the Companys Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Advances owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent, and
Lenders shall continue to 
  64 



deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the
indemnity under Section 7.05 with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s).  Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that
such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to the following: (A) any reduction in principal, interest or fees payable
to such Lender under this Agreement, (B) the postponement of any date fixed for the payment of any principal, interest or fees under this Agreement and (C

tated interest) of each Participants interest in the Advances or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register);
provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans,
letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent)
shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (e) Certain Pledges. Anything in this Section 8.07 to the
contrary notwithstanding, any Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of its rights to payment of the Advances owing to it hereunder, including (i) to any Federal Reserve Bank (and its transferees) as collateral security pursuant to
Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any applicable Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank or Central Bank or (ii) to any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender. No such
assignment shall have the effect of releasing such Lender from its obligations hereunder. 
  65 


SECTION 8.08 Limitation on Assignments and Participations. (a) Any Lender may, in
connection with any actual or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to Section 8.07, disclose to the actual or proposed assignee or participant any information relating to any Loan Party furnished to such Le

elating to
such Loan Party received by it from such Lender or such Loan Party.  (b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 8.07 to the contrary, no
Lender shall have the right to assign its rights and obligations hereunder or any interest therein or to sell participations to one or more banks or other financial institutions in all or a portion of its rights hereunder or any interest therein
where the result of such assignment or participation would be reasonably expected to entitle the Lender to claim additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.02(d), 2.06, 2.08, 2.10 or 8.04 or would otherwise result in an increase in a
Borrowers obligations.  SECTION 8.09 Withholding. (a) If any Lender, or any Person that becomes a party to this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.07, is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, such Person agrees that, prior to the first date on which any payment is due to it hereunder, it will deliver to each of
the Company and the Administrative Agent (i) two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI or successor applicable form, as the case may be, certifying in each case that such Person is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement, without deduction or withholding of any United States federal
income taxes, and (ii) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E or successor applicable form, or any other Internal Revenue Service Form prescribed by
applicable law, as the case may be, to establish an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Each Person which delivers to the Company the relevant Form pursuant to the preceding sentence further undertakes to deliver to each of the
Company and the Administrative Agent two further copies of the relevant Form, or successor applicable forms, or other manner of certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Company and the Administrative Agent, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by the Company or the Administrative
Agent, certifying that such Person is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless in any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in
treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Person from duly completing and delivering any such form with
respect to it and such Person advises the Company and the Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax, and in the case of a
Form W-8BEN-E or any other Internal Revenue Service Form prescribed by applicable law, establishing an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. 
  66 


(b) Each Lender described in Section 8.09(a) above, or that is otherwise treated as a non-U.S. financial institution pursuant to FATCA, shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or
the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the
amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (b), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
SECTION 8.10 Mitigation. In the event that any Lender claims any amounts under Sections 2.02(d), 2.06, 2.08, 2.10 or 8.04(b), it
shall use all reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policies and legal and regulatory restrictions) to take actions (including, without limitation, changing the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office) so as to eliminate such
additional amounts; provided that such Lender shall not be required to take any action if, in its reasonable judgment, such action would be materially disadvantageous to it. 
SECTION 8.11 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCO

ocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, litigation or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. 
  67 


(b) Service of Process. Each Designated Borrower agrees that service of process in any
action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to CT Corporation System (the Process Agent) as agent for such Designated
Borrower in New York, New York for service of process at its address at 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011, or at such other address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by such Designated Borrower;
provided that, if the Process Agent ceases to act as such Designated Borrowers agent for service of process, such Designated Borrower will, by an instrument reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, appoint another Person (subject
to the approval of the Administrative Agent) in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York to act as such Designated Borrowers agent for service of process. Each other party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in Section 8.02. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable law. 
(c) Waiver of Venue. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in a court referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section and a claim that such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum.  SECTION 8.14 Judgment Currency. This is an international loan transaction in which the specification of Dollars or an
Alternate Currency, as the case may be (the Specified Currency), and any payment in New York City or the country of the Specified Currenc

the essence, and,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Specified Currency shall be the currency of account in all events relating to Advances denominated in the Specified Currency. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the payment obligations
of the Designated Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be discharged by an amount paid in another currency or in another place, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on
conversion to the Specified Currency and transfer to the Specified Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of the Specified Currency at the Specified Place due hereunder. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court
it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in the Specified Currency into another currency (the Second Currency), the rate of exchange which shall be applied shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures
the Administrative Agent could purchase the Specified Currency with the Second Currency on the Business Day next preceding that on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of each Designated Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender in respect of any judgment in any court shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by
the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder or under the Notes in the Second Currency to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking
procedures purchase and transfer to the Specified Place the 
  68 



Specified Currency with the amount of the Second Currency so adjudged to be due; and the Company hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against, and to pay the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on demand in the Specified Currency, any difference between the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent
or such Lender, as the case may be, for such judgment in the Specified Currency and the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased and transferred. 
SECTION 8.15 USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender hereby notifies each Loan Party that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act
(Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the Act), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Loan Parties, which
information includes the name and address of the Borrowers and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Loan Parties in accordance with the Act. 
SECTION 8.16 No Fiduciary Duty. The Administrative Agent, each Lender and their Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of
this paragraph, the Lenders), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Loan Parties. Each of the Loan Parties agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory,
fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between the Lenders and any Loan Party, its stockholders or its affiliates. Each of the Loan Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the transactions contemplated by the
Loan Documents are arms-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and each of the Loan Parties, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to
such transaction each of the Lenders is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of any Loan Party, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other person, (iii) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary
responsibility in favor of any Loa

) the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
 (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; 
(ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial
Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such
liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or  (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in
connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.  ARTICLE IX

SECTION 9.01 Guarantee. To induce the other parties to enter into this Agreement and for other valuable consideration, receipt of
which is hereby acknowledged, the Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Administrative Agent, each Lender and their respective successors and permitted assigns the prompt payment in full when due (whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on the Advances to and the Notes of each other Loan Party and all other amounts whatsoever now or hereafter payable or becoming payable by each other Loan Party under this
Agreement and each other Loan Document, in each case strictly in accordance with the terms thereof (collectively, the Guaranteed Obligations). The Company hereby further agrees that if any other Loan Party shall fail to pay in
full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Company will promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of
payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal. This
Section 9.01 is a continuing guarantee and is a guarantee of payment and is not merely a guarantee of collection and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising.

primary, absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under any and all circumstances and that the guarantee therein is made with respect to any Guaranteed Obligations now existing or in the future arising. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company

Lender, under this Article IX:  (i) any modification or amendment (including by way of amendment, extension, renewal
or waiver), or any acceleration or other change in the time for payment or performance of the terms of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any Loan Document, or any other agreement or instrument whatsoever relating thereto, or any
modification of the Commitments;  (ii) any release, termination, waiver, abandonment, lapse or expiration, subordination or
enforcement of the liability of any other guarantee of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations;  (iii) any
application of the proceeds of any other guarantee (including the obligations of any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations) to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations in any such manner and to such extent as the
Administrative Agent may determine;  (iv) any release of any other Person (including any other guarantor with respect to
all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations) from any personal liability with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; 
(v) any settlement, compromise, release, liquidation or enforcement, upon such terms and in such manner as the Administrative
Agent may determine or as applicable law may dictate, of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guarantee of (including any letter of credit issued with respect to) all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; 
(vi) the giving of any consent to the merger or consolidation of, the sale of substantial assets by, or other restructuring or
termination of the corporate existence of, any other Loan Party or any other Person or any disposition of any shares of any Loan Party; 
(vii) any proceeding against any other Loan Party or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or
any collateral provided by any other Person or the exercise of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under the Loan Documents or otherwise in such order and such manner as the Administrative Agent
may determine, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or the Lenders shall have proceeded against or exhausted any collateral, right, remedy, power or privilege before proceeding to call upon or otherwise enforce this Article IX; 
(viii) the entering into such other transactions or business dealings with any other Loan Party, any Subsidiary or affiliate

Section 9.02(a).  (b) The enforceability and effectiveness of this Article IX and the liability of the Company,
and the rights, remedies, powers and privileges of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, under this Article IX shall not be affected, limited, reduced, discharged or terminated, and the Company hereby expressly waives to the fullest extent
permitted by law any defense now or in the future arising, by reason of:  (i) the illegality, invalidity or
unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument whatsoever relating to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; 
(ii) any disability or other defense with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, including the effect of any

FORM OF OPINION OF BROWN RUDNICK 
January 18, 2017  To each of the Lenders
and to  Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent  For the
Lenders   


 
Re:
The $1,250,000,000 364-Day Credit Agreement among Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., the Lenders party thereto and Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent 
Ladies and Gentlemen:  We have acted as special
counsel to Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., a Connecticut corporation (the Company) in connection with the negotiation, execution and delivery of that certain $1,250,000,000
364-Day Credit Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto (the Lenders) and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent for the Lenders
(in such capacity, the Administrative Agent) (the Credit Agreement).  This opinion
letter (Opinion Letter) is being delivered pursuant to Section 3.01(d) of the Credit Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein and not expressly defined herein have the definitions specified in the Credit Agreement. 
We have examined originals, certified copies or copies otherwise identified as being true copies of the following: 
 


 
(a)
the Credit Agreement;   


 
(b)
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, as of the date hereof;   


 
(c)
the Bylaws of the Company as in effect as of the date hereof;   


 
(d)
the resolutions duly adopted at a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company authorizing, among other things, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby;   


 
(e)
the Certificate of Legal Existence of the Company as of January 3, 2017 issued by the Connecticut Secretary of State; and

rom, or requiring indemnification of a party for any liability of any kind; (e) may, in the absence of a waiver or consent, discharge a guarantor to the extent that guaranteed debt is materially modified; and (f) limit or affect the
enforceability of provisions for default rates of interest, late charges, prepayment charges, acceleration of future amounts due (other than principal) without appropriate discount to present value, liquidated damages and penalties. 
Without limiting any of the qualifications and limitations set forth in this Opinion Letter, we express no opinion concerning the
enforceability of any provision of the Credit Agreement which purports to (1) grant jurisdiction to, or fix venue in, any particular court, (2) waive any rights which may not by law be waived (including the rights to notice upon default
and hearing), (3) provide for compounding of and payment of interest on interest, or (4) effectuate any provision in the Credit Agreement which purports to limit the Administrative Agents liability or purports to excuse or indemnify the
Administrative Agent from any liability for negligent or intentional acts or omissions. The provisions of the Credit Agreement regarding the declaration of a default or event of default may be subject to enforcement of a court imposed standard of

  C-1-3 


January 18, 2017

materiality in determining whether an actionable event of default exists. We also have assumed that the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders are not subject to N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law §5-501, N.Y. Penal Law § 190.40-190.42 or have complied with the notice and other provisions thereof as well as any other states equivalents to such usury laws
that may be applicable to the Transaction.      We express no legal opinion upon any matter other than those
explicitly addressed in numbered paragraphs 1 through 4 below, and our express opinions therein contained shall not be interpreted to be implied opinions upon any other matter. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless expressly
stated herein we are rendering no opinion upon the following legal issues, laws or provisions of the Credit Agreement: (a) federal securities laws and regulations administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, state Blue
Sky laws and regulations, and laws and regulations relating to commodity (and other) futures and indices and other similar instruments; (b) Federal Reserve Board margin regulations; (c) pensi

est in
letter-of-credit rights; (s) any provisions of the Credit Agreement which purport to permit advances of funds for the payment of interest without the consent of the
Company; (t) the enforceability of any provisions of the Credit Agreement relating to any waivers (not already mentioned in this paragraph, including, without limitation, waivers of broadly or vaguely stated rights, waivers of unknown future
rights, waivers of defenses, waivers of rights granted by law, waivers of rights to notice, waivers of rights to cure defaults, waivers of statutes of limitation and waivers which require notice to be given prior to asserting a defense to the
payment of obligations or bringing any other claim or action), subrogation rights, powers of attorney, prohibitions of assignment, and delay or omission of enforcement of rights and remedies or marshaling of assets; (u) provisions of the Credit
Agreement which (i) purport to bind third parties and (ii) purport to grant set-off rights to the Administrative Agent and/or any 
  C-1-4 


January 18, 2017 
Page 5   

other Lender; (v) provisions of the Credit Agreement which provide that rights or remedies are not exclusive, that every right or remedy is cumulative and may be exercised in addition to, or
with, any other right or remedy, or that the election of some particular remedy or remedies does not preclude recourse to one or another remedy; (w) provisions of the Credit Agreement construing, interpreting and/or resolving any
inconsistencies or ambiguities in the Credit Agreement in favor of the Administrative Agent or any other Persons, or establishing evidentiary standards or purporting to make determinations conclusive or any other provisions of the Credit Agreement
which provide that the Credit Agreement shall be construed in favor of any party thereto; (x) the enforceability of any provisions of the Credit Agreement which violate public policy; (y) usury laws (other than New York usury laws); (z)
provisions in lease agreements to which the Company is a party that prohibit the granting of a license to third parties; (aa) the authority to execute, perform, or deliver the Credit Agreement to the extent the Credit Agreement would result in or
require the Company to be a counterparty to or to guarantee a swap obligation, if the Company is not an eligible contract participant under the Commodity Exchange Act; (bb) fraudulent transfer and fraudulent conveyance laws and (cc) any bail-in clause or provision and any Bail-In Action included in the Credit Agreement. 
In rendering this Opinion Letter, we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, sufficiency, completeness or
fairness of any statements, representations, warranties, descriptions, information or financial data supplied to the Administrative Agent and/or the other Lenders with respect to the Credit Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby and we
advise you that we have not independently verified the accuracy, sufficiency, completeness or fairness of any of the foregoing.  Unless
expressly provided otherwise herein, the opinions expressed herein are based solely upon the applicable facts, laws, rules and regulations in effect as of the date hereof. Any changes subsequently effective in such facts, laws, rules or regulations
may affect such opinion. We do not undertake to advise you of any changes in the opinions expressed herein from matters that might hereafter arise or be brought to our attention. 
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is our opinion that, as of the date of
this Opinion Letter:  1. The Company is a corporation existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Connecticut. 
2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Comp

ter may be disclosed only for the purpose of confirming the existence of the opinions and on a non-reliance basis, to (1) employees,
officers, directors, professional advisers, auditors and regulators of the Lenders (in each case in their capacity as such); (2) Affiliates of the Lenders and their respective employees, officers, directors, professional advisers, auditors and
regulators (in each case in their capacity as such); (3) any potential assignee, transferee, participant or sub-participant of the Credit Agreement or their professional advisers; and (4) as required by
law, order, rule, regulation, a court of competent jurisdiction, regulatory or supervisory authority or in connection with any actual or potential dispute, claim or judicial or arbitral proceedings to which the Lenders may be a party; provided,
however, such disclosure shall in no event constitute an issuance or reissuance of the opinions or otherwise extend any applicable statute of limitations.
