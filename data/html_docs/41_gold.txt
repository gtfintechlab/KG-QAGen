If by 11:00 A.M. on the Business Day immediately following notice to it of its obligation to make reimbursement in respect of an Unpaid Drawing, the Borrower has not made such reimbursement out of its available cash on hand or, in the case of the Borrower, a contemporaneous Borrowing hereunder (if such Borrowing is otherwise available to the Borrower), (w) the applicable LC Issuer shall so notify the Administrative Agent, (x) the Borrower will in each case be deemed to have given a Notice of Borrowing for Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to reimburse such Unpaid Drawing (and the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice to the Lenders of such deemed Notice of Borrowing), (y) the Lenders shall, unless they are legally prohibited from doing so, make the Revolving Loans contemplated by such deemed Notice of Borrowing (which Revolving Loans shall be considered made under ‎Section 2.01), and (z) the proceeds of such Revolving Loans shall be disbursed directly to such LC Issuer to the extent necessary to effect such reimbursement and repayment of the Unpaid Drawing, with any excess proceeds to be made available to the Borrower in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.(ii)    Obligations Absolute.  The Borrower’s obligation under this Section to reimburse the LC Issuers with respect to Unpaid Drawings (including, in each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower or any other Person may have or have had against any LC Issuer, the Administrative Agent or any Lender, including, without limitation, any defense based upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit to conform to the terms of the Letter of Credit or any non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such drawing; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse an LC Issuer for any wrongful payment made by such LC Issuer under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such LC Issuer.(g)    LC Participations.(i)    Immediately upon each LC Issuance, the applicable LC Issuer shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from such LC Issuer, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation (an “LC Participation”), to the extent of such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage of the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time of issuance, in such Letter of Credit, each substitute Letter of Credit, each drawing made thereunder, the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement with respect thereto (although LC Fees relating thereto shall be payable directly to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Revolving Lenders as provided in ‎Section 2.10 and the Revolving Lenders shall have no right to receive any portion of any fees of the nature contemplated by ‎Section 2.10(c), the obligations of the Borrower under any LC Documents pertaining thereto, and any security for, or guaranty pertaining to, any of the foregoing). 39    (ii)    In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the applicable LC Issuer shall not have any obligation relative to the Lenders other than to determine that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they appear to comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.  Any action taken or omitted to be taken by an LC Issuer under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not create for such LC Issuer any resulting liability.(iii)    If an LC Issuer makes any payment under any Letter of Credit and the Borrower shall not have reimbursed such amount in full to such LC Issuer pursuant to ‎Section 2.03(f), such LC Issuer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender of such failure, and each Revolving Lender shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such LC Issuer, the amount of such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage of such payment in Dollars and in same-day funds; provided, however, that no Revolving Lender shall be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent its Revolving Facility Percentage of such unreimbursed amount for any wrongful payment made by an LC Issuer under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such LC Issuer as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  If the Administrative Agent so notifies any Revolving Lender required to fund a payment under a Letter of Credit prior to 11:00 A.M. (local time at its Notice Office) on any Business Day, such Revolving Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable LC Issuer such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage of the amount of such payment on such Business Day in same-day funds.  If and to the extent any Revolving Lender shall not have so made its Revolving Facility Percentage of the amount of such payment available to the Administrative Agent for the account of an LC Issuer, such Revolving Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such LC Issuer, forthwith on demand, such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of such LC Issuer at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.  The failure of any Revolving Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of an LC Issuer its Revolving Facility Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall not relieve any other Revolving Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such LC Issuer its Revolving Facility Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above, but no Revolving Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Revolving Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of an LC Issuer such other Revolving Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage of any such payment.(iv)    Whenever an LC Issuer receives a payment of a reimbursement obligation as to which the Administrative Agent has received for the account of such LC Issuer any payments from the Revolving Lenders pursuant to subpart (iii) above, such LC Issuer shall pay to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to each Revolving Lender that has paid its Revolving Facility Percentage thereof, in same-day funds, an amount equal to such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage of the principal amount thereof and interest thereon accruing after the purchase of the respective LC Participations, as and to the extent so received.(v)    The obligations of the Revolving Lenders to make payments to the Administrative Agent for the account of each LC Issuer with respect to Letters of Credit shall be irrevocable and not subject to counterclaim, set-off or other defense or any other qualification or exception 40    whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following circumstances:(A)    any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents;(B)    the existence of any claim, set-off defense or other right that any Credit Party or any other Person may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Administrative Agent, any LC Issuer, any Lender, or other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transaction between the applicable account party in respect of such Letter of Credit and the beneficiary named in any such Letter of Credit), other than any claim that the Borrower may have against the applicable LC Issuer for gross negligence or willful misconduct of such LC Issuer in making payment under any applicable Letter of Credit;(C)    any draft, certificate or other document presented under the Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;(D)    the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Loan Documents; or(E)    the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default.(vi)    To the extent an LC Issuer is not indemnified by the Borrower, the Revolving Lenders will reimburse and indemnify such LC Issuer, in proportion to their respective Revolving Facility Percentages, for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature that may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by any LC Issuer in performing its respective duties in any way related to or arising out of LC Issuances by it; provided, however, that no Revolving Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such LC Issuer’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.Section 2.04    Swingline Loans.(a)    During the Revolving Facility Availability Period, the Swingline Lender agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to make a Swingline Loan or Swingline Loans to the Borrower from time to time, which Swingline Loans:  (i) shall be paid on the earlier of the Revolving Maturity Date and the 10th Business Day after such Swingline Loan is made (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that, on each date that a Borrowing is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans that were outstanding on the date such Borrowing was requested, and provided further that to the extent not repaid by the Borrower on any such dates, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested Revolving Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Loans then outstanding; (ii) shall be made only in Dollars; (iii) may be repaid or prepaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof; (iv) may only be made if after giving effect thereto (A) the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans outstanding does not exceed the Swingline Commitment, and (B) the Aggregate Revolving Facility Exposure would not exceed the Total 41    Revolving Commitment; (v) shall not be made if, after giving effect thereto, the Borrower would be required to prepay Loans or Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit pursuant to ‎Section 2.12(b) hereof; (vi) shall not be made if the proceeds thereof would be used to repay, in whole or in part, any outstanding Swingline Loan and (vii) at no time shall there be more than one (1) Borrowing of Swingline Loans outstanding hereunder.(b)    The Swingline Lender at any time may, and at least once per week shall, by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on any Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding.  Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Revolving Lenders will participate.  Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice such Revolving Lender’s pro rata share of such Swingline Loan or Loans.  Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Revolving Lender’s pro rata share of such Swingline Loan or Loans.  Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  Each Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, as provided in Sections ‎2.05, ‎2.06 and ‎2.09, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender.  Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.  The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.Section 2.05    Notice of Borrowing.(a)    Time of Notice.  Each Borrowing of a Loan (other than a Continuation or Conversion) shall be made upon notice in the form provided for below which shall be provided by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent at its Notice Office not later than (i) in the case of each Borrowing of a Eurodollar Loan, 1:00 P.M. (local time at its Notice Office) at least three Business Days’ prior to the date of such Borrowing, and (ii) in the case of each Borrowing of a Base Rate Loan, prior to 12:00 (noon) (local time at its Notice Office) on the proposed date of such Borrowing, and (iii) in the case of any Borrowing of a Swingline Loan, prior to 12:00 noon (local time at its Notice Office) on the proposed date of such Borrowing. (b)    Notice of Borrowing.  Each request for a Borrowing (other than a Continuation or Conversion) shall be made by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower by delivering written notice of such request substantially in the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto (each such notice, a “Notice of Borrowing”) or by telephone (to be confirmed immediately in writing by delivery by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower of a Notice of Borrowing), and in any event each such request shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the 42    aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be made pursuant to such Borrowing, (ii) the date of the Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the Class and Type of Loans such Borrowing will consist of, and (iv) if applicable, the initial Interest Period.  Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to confirm in writing any telephonic notice permitted to be given hereunder, the Administrative Agent may act prior to receipt of written confirmation without liability upon the basis of such telephonic notice believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer of the Borrower entitled to give telephonic notices under this Agreement on behalf of the Borrower.  In each such case, the Administrative Agent’s record of the terms of such telephonic notice shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(c)    Minimum Borrowing Amount.  The aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing by the Borrower shall not be less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount.  (d)    Maximum Borrowings.  More than one Borrowing may be incurred by the Borrower on any day; provided, however, that (i) if there are two or more Borrowings on a single day by the Borrower that consist of Eurodollar Loans, each such Borrowing shall have a different initial Interest Period, and (ii) after giving effect to all Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations at no time shall there be more than six (6) Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans outstanding hereunder.Section 2.06    Funding Obligations; Disbursement of Funds. (a)    Several Nature of Funding Obligations.  The Commitments of each Lender hereunder and the obligation of each Lender to make Loans and acquire and, in the case of Revolving Lenders, to fund LC Participations and participations in Swingline Loans, as the case may be, are several and not joint obligations.  No Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in its obligation to make Loans or fund any participation hereunder and each Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans provided to be made by it and fund its participations required to be funded by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Lender to fulfill any of its Commitments hereunder.  Nothing herein and no subsequent termination of the Commitments of any Class pursuant to ‎Section 2.11 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder and in existence from time to time or to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.(b)    Borrowings Pro Rata.  Except with respect to the making of Swingline Loans by the Swingline Lender, all Loans hereunder shall be made as follows: all Revolving Loans made hereunder, and LC Participations and participations in Swingline Loans acquired by each Lender, shall be made or acquired, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based upon each Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage of the amount of such Revolving Borrowing or Letter of Credit in effect on the date the applicable Revolving Borrowing is to be made or the Letter of Credit is to be issued.(c)    Notice to Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Lender, as applicable, written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of each proposed Borrowing (including any Borrowing of a Swingline Loan), or Conversion or Continuation thereof, and LC Issuance, and of such Lender’s proportionate share thereof or participation therein and of the other matters covered by the Notice of Borrowing, Notice of Continuation or Conversion, or LC Request, as the case may be, relating thereto. (d)    Funding of Loans.  (i)    Loans Generally. No later than 1:00 P.M. (local time at the Payment Office) on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing, each Lender will make available its amount, if any, of each Borrowing requested to be made on such date to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent promptly will make 43    available to the Borrower by depositing to its account at the Payment Office (or such other account as the Borrower shall specify) the aggregate of the amounts so made available in the type of funds received.(ii)    Swingline Loans.  No later than 1:00 P.M. (local time at the Payment Office) on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing, the Swingline Lender will make available to the Borrower by depositing to its account at the Payment Office (or such other account as the Borrower shall specify) the aggregate of Swingline Loans requested in such Notice of Borrowing.  (e)    Advance Funding.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the date of Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent its portion of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing, and the Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Administrative Agent has made the same available to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender.  If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent’s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a rate per annum equal to (i) if paid by such Lender, the overnight Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) if paid by the Borrower, the then applicable rate of interest, calculated in accordance with ‎Section 2.08, for the respective Loans (but without any requirement to pay any amounts in respect thereof pursuant to ‎Section 3.04).Section 2.07    Evidence of Obligations.(a)    Loan Accounts of Lenders.  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the Obligations of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.(b)    Loan Accounts of Administrative Agent; Lender Register.  The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record: (i) the amount of each Loan and Borrowing made hereunder, the Type thereof, the Interest Period and applicable interest rate and, in the case of a Swingline Loan, the maturity date applicable thereto; (ii) the amount and other details with respect to each Letter of Credit issued hereunder; (iii) the amount of any principal due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder; (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof; and (v) the other details relating to the Loans, Letters of Credit and other Obligations.  In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain a register (the “Lender Register”) as described in Section 11.06(c)(v).(c)    Effect of Loan Accounts, etc.  The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to ‎Section 2.07(b) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations recorded therein; provided, that the failure of the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error (other 44    than manifest error) therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Credit Party to repay or prepay the Loans or the other Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.(d)    Notes.  Upon request of any Lender (including the Swingline Lenders), the Borrower will execute and deliver to such Lender (i) a Revolving Facility Note with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith to evidence the Borrower’s obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the Revolving Loans made to it by such Lender or (ii) a Swingline Note with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith to evidence the Borrower’s obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the Swingline Loans made to it by the Swingline Lender; provided, however, that the decision of any Lender or the Swingline Lender to not request a Note shall in no way detract from the Borrower’s obligation to repay the Loans and other amounts owing by the Borrower to such Lender or the Swingline Lender.Section 2.08    Interest; Default Rate.(a)    Interest on Revolving Loans.  Except with respect to Swingline Loans, the outstanding principal amount of each Loan made by each Lender shall bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum that shall at all times be equal to (i) during such periods as such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time and (ii) during such periods as such Loan is a Eurodollar Loan, the relevant Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Loan for the applicable Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time.(b)    Interest on Swingline Loans.  The outstanding principal amount of each Swingline Loan shall bear interest from the date of the Borrowing at a rate per annum that shall be equal to the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin. (c)    Default Interest.  Notwithstanding the above provisions, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (i) automatically upon an Event of Default under ‎Section 8.01(i) hereof, and (ii) upon written notice by the Administrative Agent (which notice the Administrative Agent may give in its discretion and shall give at the direction of the Required Lenders) upon any Event of Default not described in clause (i) of this ‎Section 2.08(c), (A) the principal amount of all Loans outstanding and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all overdue interest in respect of each Loan and all fees or other amounts owed hereunder, shall thereafter bear interest (including post petition interest in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws) payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate, and (B) the LC Fees shall be increased by an additional 2% per annum in excess of the LC Fees otherwise applicable thereto.  In addition, if any amount (other than amounts as to which the foregoing subparts (A) and (B) are applicable) payable by the Borrower under the Loan Documents is not paid when due, upon written notice by the Administrative Agent (which notice the Administrative Agent may give in its discretion and shall give at the direction of the Required Lenders), such amount shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.(d)    Accrual and Payment of Interest.  Interest shall accrue from and including the date of any Borrowing to but excluding the date of any prepayment or repayment thereof and shall be payable by the Borrower: (i) in respect of each Base Rate Loan, quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December: (ii) in respect of each Eurodollar Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the case of an Interest Period in excess of three months, on the dates that are successively three months after the commencement of such Interest Period; (iii) in respect of any Swingline Loan, on the maturity date applicable thereto and the date of repayment thereof, and (iv) in respect of all Loans, other than Loans accruing interest at a Base Rate, on any repayment, prepayment or Conversion (on 45    the amount repaid, prepaid or Converted), at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise), and, after such maturity, on demand.(e)    Computations of Interest.  All computations of interest on Eurodollar Loans hereunder shall be made on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days.  All computations of interest on Base Rate Loans, Unpaid Drawings and other amounts hereunder shall be made on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable.(f)    Information as to Interest Rates.  The Administrative Agent, upon determining the interest rate for any Borrowing, shall promptly notify the Borrower and the applicable Lenders thereof.  Any changes in the Applicable Margin shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions set forth in the definition of “Applicable Margin” and the Administrative Agent will promptly provide notice of such determinations to the Borrower and the Lenders.  Any such determination by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error.Section 2.09    Conversion and Continuation of Loans.(a)    Conversion and Continuation of Loans.  The Borrower shall have the right, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to (i) Convert all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of Loans of one Type made to it into a Borrowing or Borrowings of another Type of Loans that can be made to it pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) Continue a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period as a new Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans with a new Interest Period; provided, however, that any Conversion of Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate Loans shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loans and provided further that Swingline Loans may only be made or maintained as Base Rate Loans.(b)    Notice of Continuation and Conversion.  Each Continuation or Conversion of a Loan shall be made upon notice in the form provided for below provided by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent at its Notice Office not later than (i) in the case of each Continuation of or Conversion into a Eurodollar Loan, prior to 1:00 P.M.

Each such request shall be made by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower delivering written notice of such request substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto (each such notice, a “Notice of Continuation or Conversion”) or by telephone (to be confirmed immediately in writing by delivery by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower of a Notice of Continuation or Conversion), and in any event each such request shall be irrevocable and shall specify (A) the Borrowings to be Continued or Converted, (B) the date of the Continuation or Conversion (which shall be a Business Day), and (C) the Interest Period or, in the case of a Continuation, the new Interest Period.  Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to confirm in writing any telephonic notice permitted to be given hereunder, the Administrative Agent may act prior to receipt of written confirmation without liability upon the basis of such telephonic notice believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer of the Borrower entitled to give telephonic notices under this Agreement on behalf of the Borrower.  In each such case, the Administrative Agent’s record of the terms of such telephonic notice shall be conclusive absent manifest error.Section 2.10    Fees.(a)    Commitment Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of each Revolving Lender based upon each such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage, as consideration for the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders, commitment fees (the “Commitment Fees”) 46    for the period from the Closing Date to, but not including, the Revolving Maturity Date, computed for each day at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Applicable Commitment Fee Rate times (ii) the Unused Total Revolving Commitment in effect on such day (including the aggregate outstanding amount of Swingline Loans as part of the Unused Total Revolving Commitment for the purposes of this ‎Section 2.10(a)).

Any changes in the Applicable Commitment Fee Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions set forth in the definition of “Applicable Commitment Fee Rate” and the Administrative Agent will promptly provide notice of such determination to the Borrower and the Lenders.  Any such determination by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error.  All computations of Commitment Fees, LC Fees and other Fees hereunder shall be made on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days.Section 2.11    Termination and Reduction of Commitments.(a)    Mandatory Termination of Revolving Commitments.  All of the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Maturity Date, if not sooner terminated as herein provided.(b)    [Reserved.](c)    Voluntary Termination of the Total Revolving Commitment.  Upon at least ten Business Days’ prior irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent at its Notice Office (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Revolving Lenders), the Borrower shall have the right to terminate in whole the Total Revolving Commitment, provided that (i) all outstanding Revolving Loans and Unpaid Drawings are contemporaneously prepaid in accordance with ‎Section 2.12 and (ii) either there are no outstanding Letters of Credit or the Borrower shall contemporaneously cause all outstanding Letters of Credit to be surrendered for cancellation (any such Letters of Credit to be replaced by letters of credit issued by other financial institutions acceptable to the LC Issuers and the Lenders) or shall Cash Collateralize all LC Outstandings.(d)    Partial Reduction of Total Revolving Commitment.

(local time at the Notice Office) three Business Days prior to the date of such prepayment, in the case of any prepayment of Eurodollar Loans, or (z) 12:00 noon (local time at the Notice Office) on the date of such prepayment, in the case of any prepayment of Base Rate Loans, and which notice shall promptly be transmitted by the Administrative Agent to each of the affected Lenders, provided that:(i)    each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at least (A) in the case of any prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan, $500,000 (or, if less, the full amount of such Borrowing), or an integral multiple of $250,000, and (B) in the case of any prepayment of a Base Rate Loan, $250,000 (or, if less, the full amount of such Borrowing), or an integral multiple of $50,000 and (C) in the case of a prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the full amount thereof; and(ii)    no partial prepayment of any Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall reduce the aggregate principal amount of such Loans outstanding pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto.(b)    Mandatory Prepayments.  The Loans shall be subject to mandatory prepayment, and the LC Outstandings shall be subject to cash collateralization requirements, in accordance with the following provisions:(i)    Loans Exceed the Commitments.  If on any date (after giving effect to any other payments on such date) (A) the Revolving Facility Exposure of any Lender exceeds such Lender’s Revolving Commitment, (B) the Aggregate Revolving Facility Exposure plus the principal amount of Swingline Loans exceeds the Total Revolving Commitment, or (C) the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans outstanding exceeds the Swingline Commitment, then, in the case of each of the foregoing, the Borrower shall, on such day, prepay on such date the principal amount of Revolving Loans and, after Revolving Loans have been paid in full, Unpaid Drawings, in an aggregate amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.  (ii)    Cash Collateralization of LC Outstandings and Swingline Exposure.  If on any date the LC Outstandings exceed the LC Commitment Amount, then the Borrower shall, on such day, Cash Collateralize the LC Outstandings to the extent of such excess.  If the Total Revolving Commitment is reduced to any amount that is less than the LC Outstandings and Swingline Exposure, the Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the LC Outstandings and repay the Swingline Exposure to the extent of such excess.(iii)    [Reserved.]48    (iv)    Certain Proceeds of Asset Sales.  If during any fiscal year of the Borrower, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have received cumulative Net Cash Proceeds during such fiscal year from one or more Asset Sales of at least $2,000,000 (excluding up to $6,000,000 of Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale constituting the disposition of CAH), not later than the third Business Day following the date of receipt of any Cash Proceeds in excess of such amount, an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds then received in excess of such amount from any Asset Sale shall be applied as a mandatory prepayment of the Loans in accordance with ‎Section 2.12(c) below; provided, that (A) if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (B) the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent of its intention to reinvest all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds in replacement assets useful in the business of Borrower and/or its Subsidiaries within three hundred sixty-five (365) days after the date of such Asset Sale, or enters into a binding commitment thereof within said three hundred sixty-five (365) day period and subsequently makes such reinvestment within one hundred eighty (180) days following such three hundred sixty-five (365) day period, then no such prepayment shall be required if the Borrower immediately deposits such Net Cash Proceeds in a deposit account over which the Administrative Agent has control and which constitutes part of the Collateral under the Security Documents.  So long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, amounts may be disbursed from such deposit account to or at the direction of the Borrower for application towards the costs associated with such reinvestment. Any amounts not so applied to such reinvestment or as provided in ‎Section 8.03 shall be applied to the prepayment of the Loans as provided in ‎Section 2.12(c) below.  If at the end of any such 365 day period or, if applicable, such additional 180 day period any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds has not been so reinvested, the Borrower will immediately make a prepayment of the Loans, to the extent required above.(v)    Certain Proceeds of Indebtedness.  Not later than the Business Day following the date of the receipt by any Credit Party of the cash proceeds (net of underwriting discounts and commissions, placement agent fees and other customary fees and costs associated therewith) from any sale or issuance of any Indebtedness (other than any Indebtedness permitted under ‎Section 7.04) after the Closing Date, the Borrower will make a prepayment of the Loans in an amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds in accordance with ‎Section 2.12(c) below.(vi)    Certain Proceeds of an Event of Loss.  If during any fiscal year of the Borrower, any Credit Party has received cumulative Cash Proceeds during such fiscal year from one or more Events of Loss of at least $2,000,000, not later than the third Business Day following the date of receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds in excess of such amount, the Borrower will make a prepayment of the Loans with an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds then received in excess of such amount from any Event of Loss in accordance with ‎Section 2.12(c) below.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any property suffers an Event of Loss and (A) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (B) the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in writing that it intends to rebuild or restore the affected property, that such rebuilding or restoration can be accomplished within three hundred sixty-five (365) days after the date of such Event of Loss, or enters into a binding commitment thereof within said three hundred sixty-five (365) day period and subsequently makes such reinvestment within one hundred eighty (180) days following such three hundred sixty-five (365) day period and such reinvestment will be made out of such Cash Proceeds and other funds available to the Borrower, then no such prepayment of the Loans shall be required if the Borrower immediately deposits such Net Cash Proceeds in a deposit account over which the Administrative Agent has control and constitutes part of the Collateral under the Security Documents.  If at the end of any such 365 day period or, if applicable, such additional 180 day period any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds from Events of Loss has not been so used to 49    rebuild or restore the affected property, the Borrower will immediately make a prepayment of the Loans, to the extent required above.  So long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, amounts may be disbursed from such deposit account to or at the direction of the Borrower for application to the costs of rebuilding or restoration of the affected property. Any amounts not so applied to the costs of rebuilding or restoration or as provided in ‎Section 8.03 shall be applied to the prepayment of the Loans as provided in ‎Section 2.12(c) below.(c)    Applications of Certain Prepayment Proceeds.  Each prepayment required to be made pursuant to Section 2.12(b)‎(iv), ‎(v) or ‎(vi) above shall be applied as a mandatory prepayment of principal of first, to repay any outstanding Swingline Loans, second, the outstanding Revolving Loans, and third, to Cash Collateralize the LC Outstandings.  Voluntary prepayments of outstanding Revolving Loans shall not result in a permanent reduction in the Total Revolving Commitments.  Mandatory prepayments of outstanding Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.12(b)‎(iv), ‎(v) or ‎(vi) shall not result in a permanent reduction in the Total Revolving Commitments unless an Event of Default then exists.  If an Event of Default exists, the Total Revolving Commitment shall be permanently reduced on such date in an amount equal to the amount of such required prepayment and any such reduction shall apply to proportionately (based on each Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage) and permanently reduce the Revolving Commitment of each Lender.(d)    Particular Loans to be Prepaid.  With respect to each repayment or prepayment of Loans made or required by this Section, the Borrower shall designate the Types of Loans that are to be repaid or prepaid and the specific Borrowing(s) pursuant to which such repayment or prepayment is to be made; provided, however, that (i) the Borrower shall first so designate all Loans that are Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Loans with Interest Periods ending on the date of repayment or prepayment prior to designating any other Eurodollar Loans for repayment or prepayment, and (ii) if the outstanding principal amount of Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing is reduced below the applicable Minimum Borrowing Amount as a result of any such repayment or prepayment, then all the Loans outstanding pursuant to such Borrowing shall, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, be Converted into Base Rate Loans.  In the absence of a designation by the Borrower as described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the above, make such designation in its sole discretion with a view, but no obligation, to minimize breakage costs owing under Article ‎III.(e)    Breakage and Other Compensation.  Any prepayment made pursuant to this ‎Section 2.12 shall be accompanied by any amounts payable in respect thereof under Article ‎III hereof.Section 2.13    Method and Place of Payment.(a)    Generally.  All payments made by the Borrower hereunder (including any payments made with respect to the Borrower Guaranteed Obligations under Article ‎X) under any Note or any other Loan Document shall be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense. (b)    Application of Payments.  Except as specifically set forth elsewhere in this Agreement and subject to ‎Section 8.03, (i) all payments and prepayments of Revolving Loans and Unpaid Drawings with respect to Letters of Credit shall be applied by the Administrative Agent on a pro rata basis based upon each Revolving Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage of the amount of such prepayment and (ii) all payments or prepayments of Swingline Loans shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to pay or prepay such Swingline Loans.(c)    Payment of Obligations.  Except as specifically set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, all payments under this Agreement with respect to any of the Obligations shall be made to the Administrative 50    Agent on the date when due and shall be made at the Payment Office in immediately available funds and, except as set forth in the next sentence, shall be made in Dollars. (d)    Timing of Payments.  Any payments under this Agreement that are made later than 2:00 P.M. (local time at the Payment Office) shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day.  Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest shall be payable during such extension at the applicable rate in effect immediately prior to such extension.(e)    Distribution to Lenders.  Upon the Administrative Agent’s receipt of payments hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall immediately distribute to each Lender or an LC Issuer, as the case may be, its ratable share, if any, of the amount of principal, interest, and Fees received by it for the account of such Lender.  Payments received by the Administrative Agent in Dollars shall be delivered to the Lenders or the LC Issuers, as the case may be, in Dollars in immediately available funds; provided, however, that if at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, Unpaid Drawings, interest and Fees then due hereunder then, except as specifically set forth elsewhere in this Agreement and subject to ‎Section 8.03, such funds shall be applied, first, towards payment of interest and Fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and Fees then due to such parties, and second, towards payment of principal and Unpaid Drawings then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and Unpaid Drawings then due to such parties.Section 2.14    Defaulting Lenders.  (a)    Defaulting Lender Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:(i)    Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.(ii)    Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article ‎VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to ‎Section 11.03 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any LC Issuer or Swingline Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the LC Issuers’ Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with ‎Section 2.15; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize each LC Issuer’s future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with 51    ‎Section 2.15; sixth, to on a pro rata basis the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the LC Issuers or the Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any LC Issuer or the Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or reimbursement of any payment on any Letter of Credit in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans or reimbursement of any payment on any Letter of Credit were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in ‎Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LC Outstandings owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LC Outstandings owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in LC Outstandings and Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments under the Credit Facility without giving effect to ‎Section 2.14(a)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this ‎Section 2.14(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.(iii)    Certain Fees. (1) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).  (A)    Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive LC Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Revolving Facility Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to ‎Section 2.15.  (B)    With respect to any LC Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (B) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in LC Outstandings or Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to the LC Issuers and the Swingline Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to each LC Issuers’ or the Swingline Lender’s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.(iv)    Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure.  All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in LC Outstandings and Swingline Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Facility Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in ‎Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at 52    such time, and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Facility Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Commitment.  Subject to Section 11.28, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.(v)    Cash Collateral; Repayment of Swingline Loans.  If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Lender’s Fronting Exposure, and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the LC Issuers’ Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in ‎Section 2.15.(b)    Defaulting Lender Cure.

So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swingline Loan and (ii) no LC Issuer shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.Section 2.15    Cash Collateral.(a)    At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or any LC Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the LC Issuers’ Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to ‎Section 2.14(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.(b)    Grant of Security Interest.  The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the LC Issuers, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lenders’ obligation to fund participations in respect of LC Outstandings, to be applied pursuant to clause (c) below.  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuers as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash 53    Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).(c)    Application.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this ‎Section 2.15 or ‎Section 2.14 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender’s obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Outstandings (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.(d)    Termination of Requirement.  Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce the LC Issuers’ Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this ‎Section 2.15 following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuers that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to ‎Section 2.14, the Person providing Cash Collateral and the LC Issuers may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations and provided, further that in such event, to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by the Borrower, such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Loan Documents.Section 2.16    Increase in Credit Facility.(a)    The Borrower may from time to time, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, request increases in the Total Revolving Commitment (each, an “Incremental Revolving Commitment” and the loans thereunder, “Incremental Revolving Loans” and each Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment is sometimes referred to herein individually as an “Incremental Facility” and collectively as the “Incremental Facilities”), in each case, in a minimum amount of not less than $5,000,000 (or such lesser amount as agreed to by the Administrative Agent) that is a multiple of $1,000,000, provided that the aggregate amount of increases pursuant to this ‎Section 2.16 shall not exceed the Incremental Facility Amount.  Upon the approval of such request by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall deliver a copy thereof to each Lender.  Such notice shall set forth the amount of the requested Incremental Facility and the date on which such Incremental Facility is requested to become effective (which must be prior to the termination of the Revolving Facility Availability Period) and shall offer each such Lender the opportunity to participate in such Incremental Facility.  Each such Lender shall, by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent given within the specified time period set forth in the Administrative Agent’s notice, either agree to participate in such Incremental Facility, by all or a portion of the offered amount (each such Lender so agreeing being an “Increasing Lender”) or decline to increase its Revolving Commitment (and any such Lender that does not timely deliver such a notice shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Revolving Commitment and each Lender so declining or being deemed to have declined being a “Non-Increasing Lender”).  In the event that the Increasing Lenders shall have agreed pursuant to the preceding sentence to participate in such Incremental Facility in an aggregate amount less than the Incremental Facility requested by the Borrower, the Borrower may arrange for one or more banks or other entities (any such bank or other entity referred to in this clause being an “Augmenting Lender”), which may include any Lender, to extend Incremental Commitments or increase their existing Commitments in an aggregate amount equal to the unsubscribed amount; provided (i) that each Augmenting Lender, if not already a Revolving Lender, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld); and (ii) the Borrower and each Augmenting Lender shall execute all such documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence such Augmenting Lender’s Incremental Revolving Commitment Facility and/or its status as a Lender.  No Lender shall have any obligation, express or implied, to participate in such Incremental Facility.  Any Incremental Facility may be made in an amount that is less than the Incremental Facility requested by the Borrower if the Borrower is unable to arrange for, or chooses not to arrange for, 54    Augmenting Lenders.  No consent of any Lender (other than any Lenders participating in the Incremental Facility) shall be required for any Incremental Facility pursuant to this ‎Section 2.16.  (b)    Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and agreed that any Incremental Revolving Commitments shall be effected solely as an increase in the Revolving Commitments and the Obligations in respect of any Incremental Facility shall rank pari passu in right of payment and security with the original Loans and Commitments; provided that if the drawn pricing for Incremental Revolving Commitments is higher than the drawn pricing for the then-existing Revolving Commitments, then the drawn pricing for the then-existing Revolving Commitments shall be increased so that it is equal to the Applicable Margin for the Incremental Revolving Commitments.(c)    Each of the parties hereto agrees that the Administrative Agent may take any and all actions as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that, after giving effect to any Incremental Facility pursuant to this ‎Section 2.16(c), the outstanding Revolving Loans (if any) are held by the Revolving Lenders in accordance with their new Revolving Facility Percentages.  This may be accomplished at the discretion of the Administrative Agent (w) by requiring the outstanding  Loans to be prepaid with the proceeds of Incremental Loans, (x) by causing Non-Increasing Lenders to assign portions of their outstanding Loans to Increasing Lenders and Augmenting Lenders, (y) by permitting the Revolving Loans outstanding at the time of any increase in the Commitment pursuant to this ‎Section 2.16(c) to remain outstanding until the last days of the respective Interest Periods therefor, even though the Revolving Lenders would hold such Revolving Loans other than in accordance with their new Revolving Facility Percentages, or (z) by any combination of the foregoing.  (d)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incremental Facility shall become effective under this ‎Section 2.16 unless, (i) after giving effect to such Incremental Facility (including on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to the incurrence of such Incremental Facility as if it were incurred on and as of the last date of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to ‎Section 6.01 and as if all commitments thereunder had been drawn in full), no Event of Default or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would be an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, (ii) after giving effect to such Incremental Facility, the Leverage Ratio shall not exceed the Leverage Ratio then permitted under ‎Section 7.07(a), on a Pro Forma Basis and a

been delivered pursuant to Section 6.01(a) or (b), after giving effect to the borrowing of such Incremental Facility and the application of the proceeds thereof, and as if all Incremental Revolving Commitments had been drawn in full, (iii) all representations and warranties of the Credit Parties contained herein or in the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (or in the case of any representation and warranty already subject to a materiality qualifier, true and correct in all respects) with the same effect as though such representations and warranties had been made on and as of the date of such Incremental Facility, except to the extent that such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier specified date, in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of the date when made, (iv) the other conditions set forth in ‎Section 4.02 hereof shall have been satisfied, and (v) the Administrative Agent shall have received (with sufficient copies for each of the Lenders) legal opinions, board resolutions and an officer’s certificate consistent with those delivered on the Closing Date under Article ‎IV.(e)    Commitments in respect of Incremental Loans shall become Commitments under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (an “Incremental Amendment”) to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Increasing Lender agreeing to provide such Commitment, if any, each Augmenting Lender, if any, and the Administrative Agent.  The Incremental Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and 55    the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.16.  The Administrative Agent is expressly permitted to effect such amendments to the Loan Documents as may be necessary or advisable to give effect to any increase pursuant to this Section 2.16, including mechanical changes necessary or advisable in connection therewith (including amendments to implement the requirements in the preceding two sentences, amendments to ensure pro rata allocations of Eurodollar Loans and Base Rate Loans between Loans incurred pursuant to this Section 2.16 and Loans outstanding immediately prior to any such incurrence and amendments to implement ratable participation in Letters of Credit among the Incremental Revolving Commitments and the Revolving Commitments outstanding immediately prior to any such incurrence). ARTICLE III.      INCREASED COSTS, ILLEGALITY AND TAXESSection 3.01    Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurodollar Loans, etc.(a)    Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall: (i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate) or any LC Issuer;(ii)    subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or(iii)    impose on any Lender or any LC Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, such LC Issuer or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, such LC Issuer or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, LC Issuer or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such LC Issuer or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, such LC Issuer or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.(b)    Capital Requirements.  If any Lender or any LC Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such LC Issuer or any Applicable Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s or such LC Issuer’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such LC Issuer’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or such LC Issuer’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Revolving Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such LC Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or such LC Issuer or such Lender’s or such LC Issuer’s holding company could have achieved but 56    for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such LC Issuer’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or such LC Issuer’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such LC Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such LC Issuer or such Lender’s or such LC Issuer’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.(c)    Certificates for Reimbursement.  A certificate of a Lender or an LC Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such LC Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such LC Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.(d)    Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any LC Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or LC such Issuer’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an LC Issuer pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or such LC Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender’s or such LC Issuer’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).Section 3.02    Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or Continue Eurodollar Loans or to Convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Loans and shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, at the Borrower’s option, Convert all Eurodollar Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate with respect to any Base Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the 57    Eurodollar Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.Section 3.03    Inability to Determine Rates.  If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.  Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified thereinSection 3.04    Breakage Compensation.  The Borrower shall compensate each Lender (including the Swingline Lender), upon its written request (which request shall set forth the detailed basis for requesting and the method of calculating such compensation), for all reasonable losses, costs, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, cost, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund its Eurodollar Loans or Swingline Loans) which such Lender may sustain in connection with any of the following: (a) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender or the Administrative Agent) a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Continuation or Conversion (whether or not withdrawn by the Borrower or deemed withdrawn pursuant to Sections ‎3.01, ‎3.02 or ‎3.03); (b) if any such repayment, prepayment, Conversion or Continuation of any Eurodollar Loan occurs on a date that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto or any Swingline Loan is paid prior to its maturity date; (c) if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the Borrower; (d) as a result of an assignment by a Lender of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto pursuant to a request by the Borrower pursuant to ‎Section 3.06(b); or (v) as a consequence of (y) any other default by the Borrower to repay or prepay any Eurodollar Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or (z) an election made pursuant to ‎Section 3.06(b).  The written request of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable 58    Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Credit Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.(c)    Payment of Other Taxes by the Credit Parties.  The Credit Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.(d)    Indemnification by the Credit Parties.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(e)    Indemnification by the Lenders.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of ‎Section 11.06(b) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).(f)    Evidence of Payments.

(a)    The Borrower has furnished to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders complete and correct copies of:  (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 and the related audited consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, and (ii) unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related statements of operations and cash flows of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for each interim quarterly period subsequent to June 30, 2016 ended at least 45 days prior to the Closing Date.

The Borrower and its Subsidiaries did not have as of the date of the latest financial statements referred to above, and will not have as of the Closing Date after giving effect to the incurrence of Loans or LC Issuances hereunder, any material or significant contingent liability or liability for taxes, long-term lease or unusual forward or long-term commitment that is not reflected in the foregoing financial statements or the notes thereto in accordance with GAAP and that in any such case is material in relation to the business, operations, properties, assets, financial or other condition or prospects of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.(b)    The pro forma financial projections of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the period from 2017 through 2021 prepared by the Borrower and delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (which (x) have been prepared on a quarterly basis for the first four fiscal quarters following the Closing Date and on an annual basis thereafter and (y) include consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows) (the “Financial Projections”) were prepared on behalf of the Borrower in good faith after taking into account historical levels of business activity of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, known trends, including general economic trends, and all other information, assumptions and estimates considered by management of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to be pertinent thereto; provided, however, that no representation or warranty is made as to the impact of future general economic conditions or as to whether the Borrower’s projected consolidated results as set forth in the Financial Projections will actually be realized, it being recognized by the Lenders that such projections as to future events are not to be viewed as facts and that actual results for the periods covered by the Financial Projections may differ materially from the Financial Projections.  No facts are known to the Borrower as of the Closing 68    Date which, if reflected in the Financial Projections, would result in a material adverse change in the assets, liabilities, results of operations or cash flows reflected therein.Section 5.08    Solvency.  Both before and after giving effect to the Transactions, the sum of the “fair value” of the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will, as of the date hereof, exceed the sum of all debts (including contingent, subordinated, absolute, fixed, matured or unmatured and liquidated or unliquidated liabilities) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as of the date hereof.  The present fair salable value of the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is greater than the (i) total amount of present debts and liabilities (including subordinated and contingent liabilities) of Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, and (ii) amount that will be required to pay the probable liability, on a consolidated basis, of their debts and other liabilities (including subordinated and contingent liabilities) as such debts and liabilities become absolute and matured.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, do not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the business in which they are engaged as such business is now conducted and is proposed to be conducted following the date hereof.  Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries intends to incur, nor does the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries believe that they will incur, debts beyond their ability to pay such debts as they mature in the ordinary course of business.

Since June 30, 2016, there has been no change in the business, operations, property, assets, liabilities, or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower or of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except for changes none of which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.Section 5.10    Tax Returns and Payments.  Each Credit Party has filed all federal income tax returns and all other tax returns, domestic and foreign, required to be filed by it and has paid all taxes and assessments payable by it that have become due, other than those not yet delinquent and except for those contested in good faith.  Each Credit Party has established on its books such charges, accruals and reserves in respect of taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental charges for all fiscal periods as are required by GAAP.  No Credit Party knows of any proposed assessment for additional federal, foreign or state taxes for any period, or of any basis therefor, which, individually or in the aggregate, taking into account such charges, accruals and reserves in respect thereof as the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have made, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.Section 5.11    Title to Properties, etc.  Each Credit Party has good and marketable title, in the case of Real Property, and good title (or valid Leaseholds, in the case of any leased property), in the case of all other property, to all of its properties and assets free and clear of Liens other than Permitted Liens.  The interests of the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries in the properties reflected in the most recent balance sheet referred to in ‎Section 5.07(a), taken as a whole, were sufficient, in the judgment of the Credit Parties, as of the date of such balance sheet for purposes of the ownership and operation of the businesses conducted by the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries.

All licenses, permits, registrations or approvals required for the conduct of the business of each Credit Party and each of their Subsidiaries under any Environmental Law have been secured and each Credit Party and each of their Subsidiaries is in substantial compliance therewith, except for licenses, permits, registrations or approvals the failure to secure or to comply therewith is not material to the Credit Parties or their businesses.  No Credit Party nor any of their Subsidiaries has received written notice, or otherwise knows, that it is in any respect in noncompliance with, breach of or default under any applicable writ, order, judgment, injunction, or decree to which such Credit Party or such Subsidiary is a party or that would affect the ability of such Credit Party or such Subsidiary to operate its

Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any Lender so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking any action hereunder.Section 9.13    Collateral Matters.  At any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may from time to time make such disbursements and advances (“Agent Advances”) that the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, reasonably deems necessary or desirable to preserve, protect, prepare for sale or lease or dispose of the Collateral or any portion thereof, to enhance the likelihood or maximize the amount of repayment by the Borrower of the Loans, Letters of Credit, and other Obligations or to pay any other amount chargeable to the Borrower or the other Credit Parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, costs, fees and expenses as described in ‎Section 11.01.

Without limitation of its obligations pursuant to ‎Section 9.09, each Lender agrees that it shall make available to the Administrative Agent, upon the Administrative Agent’s demand, in Dollars in immediately available funds, the amount equal to such Lender’s pro rata share of each such Agent Advance.  If such funds are not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such funds on demand from such Lender, together with interest thereon for each day from the date such payment was due until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for three Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate.Section 9.14    Agency for Perfection.  The Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby appoints the Administrative Agent and each other Lender as agent and bailee for the purpose of perfecting the security interests in and liens upon the Collateral in assets that, in accordance with Article 9 of the UCC, can be perfected only by possession or control (or where the security interest of a secured party with possession or control has priority over the security interest of another secured party) and the Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby acknowledges that it holds possession of or otherwise controls any such Collateral for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as secured party.  Should any Lender obtain possession or control of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof, and, promptly upon the Administrative Agent’s request therefor shall deliver such Collateral to the Administrative Agent or in accordance with the Administrative Agent’s instructions.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender hereby appoints the Administrative Agent for the purpose of perfecting the Administrative Agent’s Liens on the Deposit Accounts or on any other deposit accounts or Securities Accounts of any Credit Party.

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lenders or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.  Further, nothing contained in this ‎Section 9.15 shall affect or preclude the ability of any Lender to (i) file and prove such a claim in the event that the Administrative Agent has not acted within ten (10) days prior to any applicable bar date and (ii) require an amendment of the proof of claim to accurately reflect such Lender’s outstanding Obligations.Section 9.16    Posting of Approved Electronic Communications.(a)    Delivery of Communications.

If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, each LC Issuer, and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held, and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing, by such Lender, such LC Issuer or any such Affiliate, to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any other Credit Party against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower or such Credit Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or such LC Issuer or their respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender, such LC Issuer or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower or such Credit Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender or the such LC Issuer different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of ‎Section 2.14 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuers, and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.  The rights of each Lender, each LC Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this ‎Section 11.03 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, such LC Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have.  Each Lender and each LC Issuer agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.105    Section 11.04    Equalization.(a)    Equalization. If at any time any Lender receives any amount hereunder (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the exercise of the right of setoff or banker’s lien, by counterclaim or cross action, by the enforcement of any right under the Loan Documents, or otherwise) that is applicable to the payment of the principal of, or interest on, the Loans (other than Swingline Loans), LC Participations, participations in Swingline Loans or Fees (other than Fees that are intended to be paid solely to the Administrative Agent or an LC Issuer and amounts payable to a Lender under Article ‎III), of a sum that with respect to the related sum or sums received by other Lenders is in a greater proportion than the total of such Obligation then owed and due to such Lender bears to the total of such Obligation then owed and due to all of the Lenders immediately prior to such receipt, then such Lender receiving such excess payment shall notify the Administrative Agent and purchase for cash without recourse or warranty from the other Lenders an interest in the Obligations to such Lenders in such amount as shall result in a proportional participation by all of the Lenders in such amount.  The provisions of this ‎Section 11.04(a) shall not be construed to apply to (i) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), or (ii) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in L/C Outstandings to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).(b)    Recovery of Amounts.  If any amount paid to any Lender pursuant to subpart (a) above is recovered in whole or in part from such Lender, such original purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price restored ratably to the extent of the recovery.  (c)    Consent of Borrower.  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.Section 11.05    Notices.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of all the Lenders, provided, further, that any assignment or participation by a Lender of any of its rights and obligations hereunder shall be effected in accordance with this ‎Section 11.06.(b)    Participations.  Each Lender may at any time grant participations in any of its rights hereunder or under any of the Notes to an Eligible Assignee or any other Person, provided that in the case of any such participation,107    (i)    the participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, including rights of consent, approval or waiver (the participant’s rights against such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by such Lender in favor of the participant relating thereto),(ii)    such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitments hereunder) shall remain unchanged,(iii)    such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,(iv)    such Lender shall remain the holder of the Obligations owing to it and of any Note issued to it for all purposes of this Agreement, and(v)    the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with the selling Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation, except that the participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Article ‎III to the extent that such Lender would be entitled to such benefits if the participation had not been entered into or sold,and, provided, further, that no Lender shall transfer, grant or sell any participation under which the participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of this Agreement or any other Loan Document except to the extent (A) such participant is an Affiliate or an Approved Fund of the Lender granting the participations or (B) such amendment or waiver would (x) extend the final scheduled maturity of the date of any scheduled repayment of any of the Loans in which such participant is participating, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon (except in connection with a waiver of the applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates), or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase such participant’s participating interest in any Commitment over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall not constitute a change in the terms of any such Commitment), (y) release all or any substantial portion of the Collateral, or release any guarantor from its guaranty of any of the Obligations, except in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, or (z) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and, provided still further that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of ‎Section 3.01 with respect to its participation as if it was a Lender, except that a participant shall (i) only deliver the forms described in ‎Section 3.05(g) to the Lender granting it such participation and (ii) not be entitled to receive any greater payment under ‎Section 3.01 or ‎Section 3.05 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive absent the participation except to the extent such entitlement to a greater payment arose from a Change in Law after the participant became a participant hereunder.In the event that any Lender sells participations in a Loan, such Lender shall, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of all participants in such Loan and the principal amounts of and stated interest on the portion of such Loan that is the subject of the participation (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be 108    conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.(c)    Assignments by Lenders.(i)    Any Lender may assign all, or if less than all, a fixed portion, of its Loans, LC Participations, participations in Swingline Loans and/or Commitments and its rights and obligations hereunder to one or more Eligible Assignees, each of which shall become a party to this Agreement as a Lender by execution of an Assignment Agreement; provided, however, that(A)    except in the case of (x) an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Loans and/or Commitments or (y) an assignment to another Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment so assigned (which for this purpose includes the Loans outstanding thereunder) shall not be less than $5,000,000 in the case of any assignment of Revolving Loans and/or Revolving Commitments, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);(B)    in the case of any assignment to an Eligible Assignee at the time of any such assignment the Lender Register shall be deemed modified to reflect the Commitments of such new Lender and of the existing Lenders;(C)    upon surrender of the old Notes, if any, upon request of the new Lender, new Notes will be issued, at the Borrower’s expense, to such new Lender and to the assigning Lender, to the extent needed to reflect the revised Commitments; and(D)    unless waived by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall receive at the time of each such assignment, from the assigning or assignee Lender, the payment of a non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500.(ii)    Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned.(iii)    To the extent of any assignment pursuant to this subpart (c), the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to its assigned Commitments provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.  (iv)    At the time of each assignment pursuant to this subpart (c), to a Person that is not already a Lender hereunder, the respective assignee Lender shall provide to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent the applicable Internal Revenue Service Forms (and any necessary additional documentation) described in ‎Section 3.05(g).(v)    With respect to any Lender, the transfer of any Commitment of such Lender and the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such Commitment shall 109    not be effective until such transfer is recorded on the Lender Register maintained by the Administrative Agent (on behalf of and acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower) with respect to ownership of such Commitment and Loans, including the name and address of the Lenders and the principal amount of the Loans (and stated interest thereon).  Prior to such recordation, all amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such Commitment and Loans shall remain owing to the transferor.  The registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any Commitments and Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Lender Register only upon the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment Agreement pursuant to this subpart (c).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Lender Register shall be available for the inspection by the Borrower at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.(vi)    Nothing in this Section shall prevent or prohibit (A) any Lender that is a bank, trust company or other financial institution from pledging its Notes or Loans to a Federal Reserve Bank or to any Person that extends credit to such Lender in support of borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank or such other Person, or (B) any Lender that is a trust, limited liability company, partnership or other investment company from pledging its Notes or Loans to a trustee or agent for the benefit of holders of certificates or debt securities issued by it.  No such pledge, or any assignment pursuant to or in lieu of an enforcement of such a pledge, shall relieve the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.(vii)    In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuers, the Swingline Lender and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Revolving Facility Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.Notwithstanding anything contained herein, no Lender may assign, sell, negotiate or otherwise transfer its Loans, LC Participations, participations in Swingline Loans and/or Revolving Commitments to any Credit Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof.(d)    No SEC Registration or Blue Sky Compliance.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, no transfer or assignment of the interests or obligations of any Lender hereunder or any grant of participation therein shall be permitted if such transfer, assignment or grant would require the Borrower to file a registration statement with the SEC or to qualify the Loans under the “Blue Sky” laws of any State.110    (e)    Special Purpose Funding Vehicles  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (“Granting Lender”) may, at its sole cost and expense not to be passed on to Borrower, grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (a “SPC”), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (x) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loans and (y) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof.  The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement, and (ii) all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender.  In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.  In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this clause, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.  This Section may not be amended without the written consent of the SPC.  The Borrower acknowledges and agrees, subject to the next sentence, that, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each SPC, for purposes of Sections ‎2.09, ‎2.13, ‎3.01, ‎3.02, ‎3.03, ‎3.05, ‎11.01, ‎11.02 and ‎11.03 shall be considered a Lender.  The Borrower shall not be required to pay any amount under Sections ‎2.09, ‎2.13, ‎3.01, ‎3.02, ‎3.03, ‎3.05, ‎11.01, ‎11.02 and ‎11.03 that is greater than the amount that it would have been required to pay had no grant been made by a Granting Lender to a SPC.Section 11.07    No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.  No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document and no course of dealing between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder.  No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or any LC Issuance shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any LC Issuer may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time.  The rights and remedies herein expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies that the Administrative Agent or any Lender would otherwise have.Section 11.08    Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this ‎Section 11.12(e) or elsewhere herein, each Lender shall be authorized to take such action to preserve or enforce its rights against any Credit Party where a deadline or limitation period is otherwise applicable and would, absent the taking of specified action, bar the enforcement of Obligations held by such Lender against such Credit Party, including the filing of proofs of claim in any insolvency proceeding.(f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this ‎Section 11.12, (x) Security Documents (including any Additional Security Documents) and related documents executed by Subsidiaries of the Borrower in connection with this Agreement may be in a form reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent and may be amended, supplemented and waived with the consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower without the need to obtain the consent of any other Person if such amendment, supplement or waiver is delivered in order (i) to comply with local law or advice of local counsel, (ii) to cure ambiguities, omissions, mistakes or defects or (iii) to cause such Security Document or other document to be consistent with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (y) if following the Closing Date, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall have jointly identified an ambiguity, inconsistency, obvious error or any error or omission of a technical or immaterial nature, in each case, in any provision of the Loan Documents, then the Administrative Agent and the Credit Parties shall be permitted to amend such provision and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Loan Documents if the same is not objected to in writing by the Required Lenders within five (5) Business Days following receipt of notice thereof.115    (g)    If, in connection with any proposed amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent with respect to any provisions hereof as contemplated by this ‎Section 11.12 that requires the consent of a greater percentage of the Lenders than the Required Lenders, the consent of the Required Lenders shall have been obtained but the consent of a Lender whose consent is required shall not have been obtained (each a “Non-Consenting Lender”), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with the restrictions contained in ‎Section 11.06(c)), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations; provided that (A) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts, including any breakage compensation under ‎Section 3.04 and any amounts accrued and owing to such Lender under Section ‎3.01(a), ‎3.01(b), ‎3.03 and ‎3.05), and (C) such Eligible Assignee shall consent at the time of such assignment to each matter in respect of which such Non-Consenting Lender did not consent.  Each Lender agrees that, if it becomes a Non-Consenting Lender and is being replaced in accordance with this ‎Section 11.12(g), it shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment Agreement to evidence such assignment and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Notes previously delivered to such Non-Consenting Lender.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.Section 11.13    Survival of Indemnities.  All indemnities set forth herein including, without limitation, in Article ‎III, ‎Section 9.09 or ‎Section 11.02 shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making and repayment of the Obligations.Section 11.14    Domicile of Loans.  Each Lender may transfer and carry its Loans at, to or for the account of any branch office, subsidiary or affiliate of such Lender; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be responsible for costs arising under ‎Section 3.01, ‎3.02 or ‎3.03 resulting from any such transfer (other than a transfer pursuant to ‎Section 3.06) to the extent not otherwise applicable to such Lender prior to such transfer.Section 11.15    Confidentiality.(a)    Each of the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuers, the Swingline Lender and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, except that Confidential Information may be disclosed (1) to its and its Affiliates’ Related Parties (it being understood that the persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Confidential Information and instructed to keep such Confidential Information confidential), (2) to any actual or prospective direct or indirect contractual counterparty in any Hedge Agreement (or to any such contractual counterparty’s Related Parties), so long as such contractual counterparty (or such Related Party) agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section, (3) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (4) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (5) to any other party to this Agreement, (6) to any other creditor of any Credit Party that is a direct or intended beneficiary of any of the Loan Documents, (7) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the 116    enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (8) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to any assignee of or participant in, or any prospective assignee or participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, or in connection with transactions permitted pursuant to ‎Section 11.06(c)(vi) or ‎Section 11.06(e), (9) with the consent of the Borrower, or (10) to the extent such Confidential Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this ‎Section 11.15, or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any LC Issuer, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a non-confidential basis from a source other than a Credit Party and not otherwise in violation of this ‎Section 11.15.  In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Revolving Commitments.(b)    As used in this Section, “Confidential Information” shall mean all information received from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any LC Issuer or any Lender on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.(c)    Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. The Borrower hereby agrees that the failure of the Administrative Agent, any LC Issuer or any Lender to comply with the provisions of this Section shall not relieve the Borrower, or any other Credit Party, of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.(d)    Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the LC Issuers acknowledges that (i) the Confidential Information may include material non-public information concerning a Credit Party or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (ii) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (iii) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable laws, including United States federal and state securities laws.Section 11.16    Limitations on Liability of the LC Issuers.  The Borrower assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letters of Credit.  Neither the LC Issuers nor any of their respective officers or directors shall be liable or responsible for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by any LC Issuer against presentation of documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to such Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the Borrower shall have a claim against each LC Issuer, and each LC Issuer shall be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not consequential, damages suffered by the Borrower that the Borrower proves were caused by (i) such LC Issuer’s willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (ii) such LC Issuer’s willful failure to make lawful payment under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of documentation strictly complying with the terms and conditions 117    of such Letter of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each LC Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation.Section 11.17    General Limitation of Liability.  No claim may be made by any Credit Party, any Lender, the Administrative Agent, any LC Issuer or any other Person against the Administrative Agent, any LC Issuer, or any other Lender or the Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys or agents of any of them for any damages other than actual compensatory damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith; and the Borrower, each Lender, the Administrative Agent and each LC Issuer hereby, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, waive, release and agree not to sue or counterclaim upon any such claim for any special, consequential or punitive damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in their favor.Section 11.18    No Duty.  All attorneys, accountants, appraisers, consultants and other professional persons (including the firms or other entities on behalf of which any such Person may act) retained by the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents shall have the right to act exclusively in the interest of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and shall have no duty of disclosure, duty of loyalty, duty of care, or other duty or obligation of any type or nature whatsoever to the Borrower, to any of its Subsidiaries, or to any other Person, with respect to any matters within the scope of such representation or related to their activities in connection with such representation.  The Borrower agrees, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, not to assert any claim or counterclaim against any such persons with regard to such matters, all such claims and counterclaims, now existing or hereafter arising, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseeable, being hereby waived, released and forever discharged.Section 11.19    Lenders and Agent Not Fiduciary to Borrower, etc.  The relationship among the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuers and the Lenders, on the other hand, is solely that of debtor and creditor, and the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuers and the Lenders have no fiduciary or other special relationship with the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and no term or provision of any Loan Document, no course of dealing, no written or oral communication, or other action, shall be construed so as to deem such relationship to be other than that of debtor and creditor.Section 11.20    Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All representations and warranties herein shall survive the making of Loans and all LC Issuances hereunder, the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents the forms of which are attached as Exhibits hereto, the issue and delivery of the Notes, any disposition thereof by any holder thereof, and any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any other holder of any of the Notes or on its behalf.  All statements contained in any certificate or other document delivered to the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any holder of any Notes by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant hereto or otherwise specifically for use in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall constitute representations and warranties by the Borrower hereunder, made as of the respective dates specified therein or, if no date is specified, as of the respective dates furnished to the Administrative Agent or any Lender.Section 11.21    Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.Section 11.22    Independence of Covenants.  All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action, event, condition or circumstance is not permitted by any of 118    such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would otherwise be within the limitations or restrictions of, another covenant, shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken or event, condition or circumstance exists.Section 11.23    Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, the “Charges”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Base Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.Section 11.24    USA Patriot Act.  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders subject to the USA Patriot Act hereby notifies the Borrower and the other Credit Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Credit Party, which information includes the name and address of each Credit Party and other information that will allow the Administrative Agent and each Lender subject to the USA Patriot Act to identify each Credit Party in accordance with the USA Patriot Act.  The Borrower and the Credit Parties agree to, promptly following a request by the Lender, provide all such other documentation and information that the Administrative Agent and each Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act.Section 11.25    Advertising and Publicity.  No Credit Party shall issue or disseminate to the public (by advertisement, including without limitation any “tombstone” advertisement, press release or otherwise), submit for publication or otherwise cause or seek to publish any information describing the credit or other financial accommodations made available by the Lenders pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.  Nothing in the foregoing shall be construed to prohibit any Credit Party from making any submission or filing which it is required to make by applicable law or pursuant to judicial process; provided, that, (i) such filing or submission shall contain only such information as is necessary to comply with applicable law or judicial process and (ii) unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, the Borrower shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the requirement to make such submission or filing and provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof.Section 11.26    Release of Guarantees and Liens.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender (without requirement of notice to or consent of any Lender) to take any action requested by the Borrower having the effect of releasing any Collateral or guarantee obligations (i) to the extent necessary to permit consummation of any transaction permitted by any Loan Document or that has been consented to in accordance with the terms hereof or (ii) under the circumstances described in the next succeeding sentence.  When this Agreement has been terminated and all of the Obligations have been fully and finally discharged (other than obligations in respect of Designated Hedge Agreements, Designed Banking Services Agreements, contingent indemnity obligations and obligations in respect of Letters of Credit that have been Cash Collateralized) and the obligations of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to provide additional credit under the Loan Documents have been terminated irrevocably, and the Credit Parties have delivered to the Administrative Agent a written release of all claims against the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, in 119    form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent will, at the Borrower’s sole expense, execute and deliver any termination statements, lien releases, mortgage releases, re-assignments of intellectual property, discharges of security interests, and other similar discharge or release documents (and, if applicable, in recordable form) as are necessary or advisable to release, as of record, the Administrative Agent’s Liens and all notices of security interests and liens previously filed by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Obligations.Section 11.27    Payments Set Aside.  To the extent that any Secured Creditor receives a payment from or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Credit Party, from the proceeds of any Collateral, from the exercise of its rights of setoff, any enforcement action or otherwise, and such payment is subsequently, in whole or in part, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, then to the extent of such recovery, the obligations or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not occurred.Section 11.28    Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions. (a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any of the parties thereto, each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Designated Hedge Creditors acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by: (b)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and(c)    the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:(i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;(ii)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or(iii)    the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.[Remainder of page intentionally left blank.]120    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has caused a counterpart of this Agreement to be duly executed and delivered as of the date first above written.     TRC COMPANIES, INC., as the Borrower By:    /s/ Martin H.
