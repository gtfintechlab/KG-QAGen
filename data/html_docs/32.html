(OFAC), restricting activities in certain countries such as Iran and Sudan. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In 2006, we voluntarily disclosed to OFAC that
several of our subsidiaries formerly operating as Schreiner Airways may have violated applicable US laws and regulations by re-exporting to Iran, Sudan, and Libya certain helicopters, related parts, map data, operation and maintenance manuals, and
aircraft parts for third party customers. OFACs investigation is ongoing and we continue to fully cooperate. Should the US government determine that these activities violated applicable laws and regulations, we or our subsidiaries may be
subject to civil or criminal penalties, including fines and/or suspension of the privilege to engage in trading activities involving goods, software and technology subject to the US jurisdiction. At this time, it is not possible to determine the
outcome of this matter, or the significance, if any, to our business, financial condition and results of operations. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Brazilian customs
authorities seized one of our helicopters (customs value of $10.0 million) as a result of allegations that we violated Brazilian customs law by failing to ensure our customs agent and the customs agents third party shipping company followed
approved routing of the helicopter during transport. We secured release of the helicopter and are disputing through court action any claim for penalties associated with the seizure and the alleged violation. We have preserved our rights by filing a
civil action against our customs agent for any losses that may result. At this time, it is not possible to determine the outcome of this matter, or the significance, if any, to our business, financial condition and results of operations. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Our Brazilian subsidiary is disputing claims from the Brazilian tax authorities that it was not entitled to certain credits in 2004 and 2007. The tax
authorities are seeking up to $4.8 million in additional taxes plus interest and penalties. We believe that based on our interpretation of tax legislation and well established aviation industry practice we are in compliance with all applicable tax
legislation and plan to defend this claim vigorously. At this time, it is not possible to determine the outcome of this matter or the significance, if any, to our business, financial condition and result of operations. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Our Brazilian subsidiary is also disputing assessments from the municipal governments in Macae and Cabo Frio related to cross-border flights and
invoicing. The municipalities are seeking up to $5 million in taxes and penalties. We do not believe the Company is liable for these amounts and will continue to dispute these assessments through administrative and judicial processes. At this time,
it is not possible to determine the outcome of this matter or the significance, if any, to our business, financial condition and result of operations. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In the United Kingdom, the Ministry for Transport is investigating potential wrongdoing involving two exemployees in conjunction with the SAR-H bid award processes. This arose from our self-reporting
potential improprieties by these individuals upon their discovery in 2010. The SAR-H bid process was subsequently cancelled. We will continue to cooperate in all aspects of the investigation. At October 31, 2013, it is not possible to determine
the outcome of this matter, or the significance, if any, to our business, financial condition and results of operations. </font></p>
