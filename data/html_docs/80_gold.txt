Any notice given by the Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.6(a)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.(ii)    Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(i) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the Issuing Lender, in Dollars, at the Administrative Agent’s Office for payments in an amount equal to its Revolving Commitment Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent which date will not be earlier than the Business Day following the Honor Date, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.1(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Issuing Lender in Dollars.(iii)    With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Borrowing of Revolving Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the Issuing Lender an LOC Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which LOC Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.  In such event, each Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(ii) shall be deemed payment in 34respect of its participation in such LOC Borrowing and shall constitute an LOC Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.6.(iv)    Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or LOC Advance pursuant to this Section 2.6(a) to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender’s Revolving Commitment Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the Issuing Lender.(v)    Each Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Loans or LOC Advances to reimburse the Issuing Lender for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.6(a), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.6(a) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing).  No such making of an LOC Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Lender for the amount of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.(vi)    If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6(a) by the time specified in Section 2.6(a)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of this Credit Agreement, the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Issuing Lender in connection with the foregoing.  If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or LOC Advance in respect of the relevant LOC Borrowing, as the case may be.  A certificate of the Issuing Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(b)    Repayment of Participations.  (i)    At any time after the Issuing Lender has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender’s LOC Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.6(a), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the Issuing Lender any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of cash collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Revolving Commitment Percentage thereof in Dollars and in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.(ii)    If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.2(b) (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by 35the Issuing Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender its Revolving Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.  The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Credit Agreement.(c)    Obligations Absolute.  The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Lender for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each LOC Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:(i)    any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document;(ii)    the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that any Credit Party or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Credit Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;(iii)    any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;(iv)    any payment by the Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or(v)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Credit Party or any Subsidiary.The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower’s instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the Issuing Lender.  The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the Issuing Lender and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.(d)    Role of Issuing Lender.  Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by such Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.  None of the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent, any 36of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Lender shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or LOC Document.  The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower from pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.  None of the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Lender shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.6(c); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the Issuing Lender, and the Issuing Lender may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower prove were caused by the Issuing Lender’s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the Issuing Lender’s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.(e)    Applicability of ISP.  Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Issuing Lender and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), the rules of the ISP shall apply to each Letter of Credit.(f)    Standby Letter of Credit Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Revolving Commitment Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the “Standby Letter of Credit Fee”) in Dollars for each standby Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Percentage times the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit; provided, however, any Standby Letter of Credit Fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Revolving Commitment Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 3.18(a)(iv), with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the Issuing Lender for its own account.  For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.4.  Standby Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) due and payable on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears.  If there is any change in the Applicable Percentage during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Percentage separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Percentage was in effect.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, all Standby Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate.  37(g)    Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to Issuing Lender. The Borrower shall pay directly to the Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee in Dollars with respect to each Letter of Credit, at the rate per annum equal to 0.125% of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and on a quarterly basis in arrears.  Such fronting fee shall be due and payable on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December in respect of the most recently-ended quarterly period (or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand.  In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the Issuing Lender for its own account, in Dollars, the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the Issuing Lender relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect.  Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.(h)    Conflict with LOC Documents.  In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any LOC Document, the terms hereof shall control.(i)    Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries.  Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the Issuing Lender hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit.  The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrower’s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.(j)    Reports.  The Issuing Lender will provide to the Administrative Agent at least quarterly, and more frequently upon request, a detailed summary report on all Letters of Credit and the activity thereon, in form and substance acceptable to the Administrative Agent.  The Issuing Lender will provide copies of the Letters of Credit to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders promptly upon request.2.7    Additional Provisions relating to Swingline Loans.(a)    Refinancing of Swingline Loans.(i)    The Swingline Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorize the Swingline Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender’s Revolving Commitment Percentage of the amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding.  Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.2, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 (other than the delivery of a Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing) and provided that, after giving effect to such Borrowing, the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Obligations shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount.  The Swingline Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent.  Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Revolving Commitment Percentage of the amount specified in such Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swingline Loan) for the account of the Swingline Lender at the Administrative Agent’s Office for Dollar-denominated payments not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing, 38whereupon, subject to Section 2.7(a)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Lender.(ii)    If for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Borrowing of Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.7(a)(i), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and each Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.(iii)    If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.7(a) by the time specified in Section 2.7(a)(i), the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swingline Lender in connection with the foregoing.  If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swingline Loan, as the case may be.  A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(iv)    Each Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.7(a) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.7(a) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.2.  No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided herein.(b)    Repayment of Participations.  (i)    At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swingline Lender.(ii)    If any payment received by the Swingline Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swingline Loan is required to be returned by the Swingline Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.2(b) (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swingline Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Swingline Lender its Revolving Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum 39equal to the applicable Overnight Rate.  The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swingline Lender.  The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Credit Agreement.(c)    Interest for Account of Swingline Lender.  The Swingline Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swingline Loans.  Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.7 to refinance such Lender’s Revolving Commitment Percentage of any Swingline Loan, interest in respect of such Revolving Commitment Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swingline Lender.(d)    Payments Directly to Swingline Lender.  The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swingline Loans directly to the Swingline Lender.2.8    [Reserved]2.9    [Reserved]2.10    Increase in Commitments.(a)At any time following the Closing Date, the Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent elect to request the establishment of:(i)one or more incremental term loan commitments (any such incremental term loan commitment, an “Incremental Term Loan Commitment”) to make one or more term loans (any such additional term loans, an “Incremental Term Loan”); or(ii)one or more increases in the Revolving Commitments (any such increase, an “Incremental Revolving Commitment” and, together with the Incremental Term Loan Commitments, the “Incremental Loan Commitments”) to make additional revolving credit loans under this Agreement (any such increase, an “Incremental Revolving Credit Increase” and, together with the Incremental Term Loans, the “Incremental Loans ”);provided that (1) the total aggregate principal amount for all such Incremental Loan Commitments shall not (as of any date of incurrence thereof) exceed $250,000,000 and (2) the total aggregate amount for each Incremental Loan Commitment (and the Incremental Loans  made thereunder) shall not be less than a minimum principal amount of $10,000,000 or, if less, the remaining amount permitted pursuant to the foregoing clause (1).  Each such notice shall specify the date (each, an “Increased Amount Date”) on which the Borrower proposes that any Incremental Loan Commitment shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to Administrative Agent.  The Borrower may invite any Lender, any Affiliate of any Lender and/or any Approved Fund, and/or any other Person reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, to provide an Incremental Loan Commitment (any such Person, an “Incremental Lender”).  Any proposed Incremental Lender offered or approached to provide all or a portion of any Incremental Loan Commitment may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide such Incremental Loan Commitment.  Any Incremental Loan Commitment shall become effective as of such Increased Amount Date; provided that:(A)no Default or Event of Default shall exist on such Increased Amount Date before or after giving effect to (1) any Incremental Loan Commitment and (2) the making of any Incremental Loans pursuant thereto;40(B)the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received from the Borrower a Pro Forma Compliance Certificate demonstrating, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that the Borrower is in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in Section 7.10 based on the financial statements most recently delivered pursuant to Section 7.1(a) or 7.1(b), as applicable, both before and after giving effect (on a pro forma basis) to (x) any Incremental Loan Commitment, (y) the making of any Incremental Loans pursuant thereto (with any Incremental Loan Commitment being deemed to be fully funded) and (z) any Permitted Acquisition consummated in connection therewith;(C)each of the representations and warranties contained in Section 6 shall be true and correct in all material respects, except to the extent any such representation and warranty is qualified by materiality or reference to Material Adverse Effect, in which case, such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects, on such Increased Amount Date with the same effect as if made on and as of such date (except for any such representation and warranty that by its terms is made only as of an earlier date, which representation and warranty shall remain true and correct as of such earlier date);(D)the proceeds of any Incremental Loans shall be used for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (including Permitted Acquisitions);(E)each Incremental Loan Commitment (and the Incremental Loans made thereunder) shall constitute Obligations of the Borrower and shall be secured and guaranteed with the other Extensions of Credit on a pari passu basis;(F)    in the case of each Incremental Term Loan (the terms of which shall be set forth in a Lender joinder agreement), such Incremental Term Loan will mature and amortize in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, the Incremental Lenders making such Incremental Term Loan and the Borrower, but will not in any event have a shorter weighted average life to maturity than the remaining weighted average life to maturity of any prior Incremental Term Loan or a maturity date earlier than the latest Termination Date then in effect for any prior Incremental Term Loan or any Revolving Loan and except as provided above, all other terms and conditions applicable to any Incremental Term Loan shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower;(G)    in the case of each Incremental Revolving Credit Increase (the terms of which shall be set forth in a Lender joinder agreement):(x)    such Incremental Revolving Credit Increase shall mature on the latest Termination Date then in effect, shall bear interest and be entitled to fees (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, customary upfront fees), in each case at the rate applicable to the Revolving Loans, and shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as the Revolving Loans;(y)    the outstanding Revolving Loans and Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages of Swingline Loans and L/C Obligations will be reallocated by the Administrative Agent on the applicable Increased Amount Date among the Lenders (including the Incremental Lenders providing such 41Incremental Revolving Credit Increase) in accordance with their revised Revolving Commitment Percentages (and the Lenders (including the Incremental Lenders providing such Incremental Revolving Credit Increase) agree to make all payments and adjustments necessary to effect such reallocation and the Borrower shall pay any and all costs required pursuant to Section 3.12 in connection with such reallocation as if such reallocation were a repayment); and(z)    except as provided above, all of the other terms and conditions applicable to such Incremental Revolving Credit Increase shall, except to the extent otherwise provided in this Section 2.10, be identical to the terms and conditions applicable to the Revolving Loans under this Agreement;(H)    any Incremental Lender with an Incremental Revolving Credit Increase shall be entitled to the same pro rata voting rights as the existing Lenders under this Agreement and any Extensions of Credit made in connection with each Incremental Revolving Credit Increase shall receive proceeds of prepayments on the same pro rata basis as the other Revolving Credit Loans made hereunder;(I)    such Incremental Loan Commitments shall be effected pursuant to one or more Lender joinder agreements executed and delivered by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the applicable Incremental Lender (which Lender joinder agreement may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.10); and(J)    the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered any customary legal opinions or other documents (including, without limitation, a resolution duly adopted by the board of directors (or equivalent governing body) of each Credit Party authorizing such Incremental Loan and/or Incremental Term Loan Commitment) reasonably requested by Administrative Agent in connection with any such transaction.(b)    The Incremental Lenders shall be included in any determination of the Required Lenders, and, unless otherwise agreed, the Incremental Lenders will not constitute a separate voting class for any purposes under this Agreement.(c)    On any Increased Amount Date on which any Incremental Term Loan Commitment becomes effective, subject to the foregoing terms and conditions, each Incremental Lender with an Incremental Term Loan Commitment shall make, or be obligated to make, an Incremental Term Loan to the Borrower in an amount equal to its Incremental Term Loan Commitment and shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to such Incremental Term Loan Commitment and the Incremental Term Loan made pursuant thereto.(d)    On any Increased Amount Date on which any Incremental Revolving Credit Increase becomes effective, subject to the foregoing terms and conditions, each Incremental Lender with an Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment.2.11    Extension of Termination Date.42(a)    Requests for Extension.  The Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders) not later than ninety (90) days prior to the first, second and/or third anniversary of the Closing Date (each, an “Extension Date”), request that each Lender extend such Lender’s Termination Date for an additional year from the Termination Date then in effect hereunder (the “Existing Termination Date”); provided that no more than three extensions under this Section 2.11 may be permitted.(b)    Lender Elections to Extend.  Each Lender, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent given not later than the date (the “Notice Date”) that is fifteen (15) Business Days from the date which such Lender received notice from the Administrative Agent of the Borrower’s request for an extension of the Existing Termination Date, advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension.  Each Lender that determines not to so extend its Termination Date (a “Non‑Extending Lender”) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Notice Date), and any Lender that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non‑Extending Lender.  The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree.(c)    Notification by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of each Lender’s determination under this Section 2.11 no later than the date that is fifteen (15) days prior to the applicable Extension Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day).    (d)    Additional Commitment Lenders.  The Borrower shall have the right on or before the Extension Date (effective as of the Extension Date) to replace the Commitments of any Non‑Extending Lenders with, and at its option add as “Lenders” under this Credit Agreement, one or more Eligible Assignees (each, an “Additional Commitment Lenders”) as provided in Section 11.18, each of which Additional Commitment Lenders shall have entered into an Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which such Additional Commitment Lender shall, effective as of the applicable Extension Date, undertake a Commitment (and, if any such Additional Commitment Lender is already a Lender, its Commitment shall be in addition to such Lender’s Commitment hereunder on such date).(e)    Effect of Extension.  Effective as of the Extension Date, the Termination Date of each of the Lenders that have agreed to extend their Termination Date (each, an “Extending Lender”) and of each Additional Commitment Lender shall be extended to the date falling one year after the Existing Termination Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Termination Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Lender shall thereupon become a “Lender” for all purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that there shall be no change in the Termination Date of any Non-Extending Lender and on such Termination Date of any Non-Extending Lender, such Non-Extending Lender’s outstanding Revolving Loans shall be paid in full together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon and accrued and unpaid fees due it hereunder and such Non-Extending Lender’s obligations in respect of outstanding Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans shall terminate.(f)    Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the extension of the Termination Date pursuant to this Section shall not be effective with respect to any Lender unless:43(i)    no Default or Event of Default exists on the date of such extension and after giving effect thereto; and(ii)    the representations and warranties contained in Section 6 and the other Credit Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Extension Date, except to the extent any such representation and warranty is qualified by materiality or reference to Material Adverse Effect, in which case, such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects, on such Extension Date with the same effect as if made on and as of such date (except for any such representation and warranty that by its terms is made only as of an earlier date, which representation and warranty shall remain true and correct as of such earlier date).(g)    to the extent the Commitments of any Non-Extending Lender shall not be replaced with Commitments from one or more Additional Commitment Lenders on the applicable Extension Date as provided for in Section 2.11(d), and thus there shall be no change in the applicable Termination Date for such Non-Extending Lender, it is understood and agreed that (x) the Borrower shall repay Loans outstanding on the applicable Termination Date of any such Non-Extending Lender (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.12) to the extent necessary to repay, nonratably, the Loans of all Non-Extending Lenders and the pro rata shares of the remaining Lenders shall be revised effective as of such date, (y) on such applicable Termination Date, the Commitments of the Non-Extending Lenders will be permanently terminated and the Aggregate Commitments on and after such date will be equal to the Commitments of the remaining Lenders and (z) to the extent that the outstanding Obligations as of such date (after giving effect to the repayment in full of each such Non-Extending Lender) exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect (after giving effect to the termination of the Commitments of all Non-Extending Lenders), the Borrower shall immediately prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the LOC Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.(h)    Conflicting Provisions.  This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 3.14 and Section 11.6 to the contrary.SECTION 3OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO CREDIT FACILITY3.1    Default Rate.(a)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default pursuant to Sections 9.1(a) or 9.1(f), the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.(b)    Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any other Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.  (c)    Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.443.2    Conversion.The Borrower shall have the option, on any Business Day, to extend existing Eurocurrency Rate Loans into a subsequent Interest Period or to convert Revolving Loans of one type into Revolving Loans of another type; provided, however, that (i) except as provided in Section 3.7, Eurocurrency Rate Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans only on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) Eurocurrency Rate Loans may be extended, and Base Rate Loans may be converted into Eurocurrency Rate Loans, only if no Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date of extension or conversion, (iii) Revolving Loans extended as, or converted into, Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be in such minimum amounts as provided in Section 2.2(b), and (iv) any request for extension of or conversion to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan which shall fail to specify an Interest Period shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest Period of one month.  Each such extension or conversion shall be effected by the Borrower by giving written notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent substantially in the form of Schedule 3.2 (a “Notice of Extension/Conversion”) prior to 10:00 A.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on (x) the same Business Day of, in the case of Base Rate Loans and (y) on the second Business Day prior to, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans the date of the proposed extension or conversion, specifying the date of the proposed extension or conversion, the Revolving Loans to be so extended or converted, the types of Revolving Loans into which such Revolving Loans are to be converted and, if appropriate, the applicable Interest Periods with respect thereto.  Each request for extension or conversion to any Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be deemed to be a reaffirmation by the Borrower that no Default or Event of Default then exists.  In the event the Borrower fails to request extension of or conversion to any Eurocurrency Rate Loan in accordance with this Section, or any such conversion or extension is not permitted or required by this Section, then such Revolving Loans shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of their Interest Period.  The Administrative Agent shall give each Lender notice as promptly as practicable of any such proposed conversion affecting any Revolving Loans.  3.3    Termination of Commitments.The Borrower may from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount in whole or in part (in minimum principal amounts of $10,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof) upon three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent provided that after giving effect to any voluntary reduction the aggregate amount of Revolving Obligations shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, as reduced.3.4    Prepayments.(a)    Voluntary Prepayments.  The Borrower shall have the right to prepay Loans in whole or in part from time to time without premium or penalty; provided, however, that (A) Eurocurrency Rate Loans may only be prepaid (y) on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto or (z) on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto if the Borrower pays to the applicable Lenders any amounts due under Section 3.12, and (B) each such partial prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the amount then outstanding, if less).  Amounts prepaid on the Loans may be reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof.(b)    Mandatory Prepayments.  If at any time (i) the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Obligations shall exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, (ii) the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans shall exceed the Swingline Committed Amount or (iii) the aggregate principal amount of LOC Obligations shall exceed the LOC Committed Amount, then in any such 45instance the Borrower shall immediately make payment on the Loans and/or to a cash collateral account in respect of LOC Obligations in an amount sufficient to eliminate the difference, provided, that the Borrower may, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) above, utilize a borrowing of Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans to the extent the conditions of Section 5.2 are satisfied for such payment or cash collateral if the incurrence of such Loans would not cause the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Obligations to exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount or the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans to exceed the Swingline Committed Amount.(c)    Application.  Unless otherwise specified by the Borrower, prepayments on the Revolving Obligations shall be applied first to Daily LIBOR Swingline Loans, then to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurocurrency Rate Loans in direct order of Interest Period.(d)    Notice.  The Borrower will provide notice to the Administrative Agent of any prepayment by 10:00 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date of prepayment.3.5    Fees.(a)    Unused Fee. In consideration of the Commitments, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders a fee (the “Unused Fee”), in Dollars, for the period from the Closing Date to the last Termination Date equal to the Applicable Percentage per annum on the actual daily unused amount of the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount for the applicable period.  The Unused Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December for the immediately preceding quarter (or a portion thereof) beginning with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date and on each Termination Date.  For purposes of computation of the Unused Fee, (a) LOC Obligations shall be counted toward and considered usage of the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount and (b) Swingline Loans shall not be counted toward nor considered usage of the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount.(b)    Administrative Agent’s Fee.  The Borrower agrees to pay, in Dollars, to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the administrative and other fees referred to in the Engagement Letter.3.6    Capital Adequacy.If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Applicable Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s parent company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s (including, for purposes hereof, the parent company of such Lender) capital as a consequence of its commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then, upon written notice from such Lender to the Borrower, the Borrower shall be obligated to pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.  Such notice shall be accompanied by a statement as to the amount of such compensation and include a reasonably detailed summary of the basis for such demand with reasonably detailed calculations.  Each determination by any such Lender of amounts owing under this Section shall be reasonable and shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto.3.7    Limitation on Eurocurrency Rate Loans.If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Rate Loan:46(a)    the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market arising after the Closing Date, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period; or(b)    the Required Lenders determine (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) and notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurocurrency Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding Eurocurrency Rate Loans for such Interest Period (other than any such determination based on Taxes);then the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof, and so long as such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to make additional Eurocurrency Rate Loans, continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency Rate Loans.3.8    Illegality.Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) to make, maintain, or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof and such Lender’s obligation to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans and to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make, maintain, and fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 3.10 shall be applicable). 3.9    Requirements of Law.If any Change in Law shall:(i)    impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, assessment, or similar requirement (other than Taxes) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities or commitments of, such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office), including the Commitment of such Lender hereunder; or(ii)    impose on such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the London interbank market any other condition (other than Taxes) affecting this Credit Agreement or its Notes or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities or commitments; or (iii)    impose on any Lender or the Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; or(iv)    subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;and any Lender reasonably determines that the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, converting into, continuing, or maintaining any Eurocurrency Rate Loans or to reduce any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Credit Agreement or its Notes with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Loans, then 47the Borrower shall pay to such Lender within thirty (30) days of written demand therefor setting forth in reasonable detail such amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.  If any Lender requests compensation by the Borrower under this Section 3.9, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency Rate Loans, until the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 3.10 shall be applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested.  Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 3.9 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to it.  Any Lender claiming compensation under this Section 3.9 shall furnish to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a statement setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder (including a reasonably detailed summary of the basis for such amounts with reasonably detailed calculations) which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.3.10    Treatment of Affected Loans.If the obligation of any Lender to make any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or to continue, or to convert Base Rate Loans into, Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.8 or 3.9 hereof, such Lender’s Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for such Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of a conversion required by Section 3.8 hereof, on such earlier date as such Lender may specify to the Borrower with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that gave rise to such conversion no longer exist:(a)    to the extent that such Lender’s Eurocurrency Rate Loans have been so converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lender’s Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and(b)    all Loans that would otherwise be made or continued by such Lender as Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be made or continued instead as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be converted into Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that gave rise to the conversion of such Lender’s Eurocurrency Rate Loans pursuant to this Section 3.10 no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, such Lender’s Base Rate Loans shall be automatically converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding Eurocurrency Rate Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments.483.11    Taxes.(a)    Defined Terms.  For purposes of this Section 3.11, the term “Lender” includes any Issuing Lender and the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.(b)    Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any Credit Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Credit Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.(c)    Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.  The Credit Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.(d)    Indemnification by the Credit Parties.  The Credit Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority, except to the extent that such Indemnified Taxes are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Recipient.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(e)    Indemnification by the Lenders.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.3(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Credit Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Credit Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).49(f)    Evidence of Payments.  Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, after any payment of Taxes by any Credit Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.11, such Credit Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent as soon as practical after receiving such request, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.(g)    Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Credit Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.11(g)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:(i)  in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Credit Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Credit Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;(ii)  executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;(iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Schedule 3.11-1 to the effect that such Foreign 50Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (a “Withholding Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a Withholding Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Schedule 3.11-2 or Schedule 3.11-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a Withholding Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Schedule 3.11-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;(C)  any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Credit Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.(h)    Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund (whether received in cash or as an overpayment applied to offset an amount of Tax otherwise due and payable) of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.11 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to Section 3.11(b)), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity 51payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragrap

 to such Tax had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.(i)    Claim Period.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.11(a) or Section 3.11(b), if any Recipient requests indemnification or compensation for Indemnified Taxes pursuant to this Section 3.11 more than one hundred eighty (180) days after the earlier of (i) the date on which such Recipient makes payment of such Indemnified Taxes, and (ii) the date on which the Recipient receives written notice from the applicable Governmental Authority demanding payment of such Indemnified Taxes, then the Credit Parties shall not be obligated to indemnify or reimburse such Recipient for such Indemnified Taxes.(j)    Survival.  Each party’s obligations under this Section 3.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Credit Document.3.12    Compensation.  Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:(a)    any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or(b)    any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or(c)    The assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 11.18.52including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract (but excluding any loss of anticipated profits).   For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.12, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the applicable offshore Dollar interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded.3.13    Pro Rata Treatment.Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:(a)    Loans and Letters of Credit.  Each Revolving Loan advance, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Revolving Loan (other than Swingline Loans) or reimbursement obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment of interest on the Revolving Loans or reimbursement obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment of Unused Fees, each payment of the Standby Letter of Credit Fee, each reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount and each conversion or extension of any Revolving Loan (other than Swingline Loans), shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective Revolving Commitment Percentages.(b)    Advances.  (i)    No Lender shall be responsible for the failure or delay by any other Lender in its obligation to make its ratable share of a borrowing hereunder, except for adjustments provided in Section 3.18(a)(iv) to the Revolving Commitment Percentage of each Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to fulfill its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder.(ii)    Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto.  If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then:(A)    if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds, at the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect; and(B)    if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the “Compensation Period”) at a rate per annum 53equal to the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.  If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent’s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing.Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights that the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.3.14    Sharing of Payments.The Lenders agree among themselves that, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan, LOC Obligations or any other obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker’s lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such payment as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders a Participation Interest in such Loans, LOC Obligations and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Credit Agreement.  The Lenders further agree among themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker’s lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a Participation Interest theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto) to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a Participation Interest may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including setoff, banker’s lien or counterclaim, with respect to such Participation Interest as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan, LOC Obligations or other obligation in the amount of such Participation Interest.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall fail to remit to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender or the Administrative Agent to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each date from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate.  If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 3.14 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this Section 3.14 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.3.15    Payments, Computations, Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Percentage, Etc.(a)    Generally.  All payments hereunder and under any other Credit Document shall be made by the Borrower without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff of any kind.  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments made by a Credit Party hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent in Dollars in Same Day Funds, at the Administrative Agent’s office 54specified in Section 11.1.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. All payments shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date when due in the case of payments in Dollars.  Payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) debit the amount of any such payment which is not made by such time to any ordinary deposit account of the Borrower or any other Credit Party maintained with the Administrative Agent (with notice to the Borrower or such other Credit Party).  The Borrower shall, at the time it makes any payment under this Credit Agreement, specify to the Administrative Agent the Loans, LOC Obligations, Fees, interest or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails so to specify, or if such application would be inconsistent with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Lenders in such manner as the Administrative Agent may determine to be appropriate in respect of obligations owing by the Borrower hereunder, subject to the terms of Section 3.13(a)).  The Administrative Agent will distribute such payments to such Lenders, if any such payment is received prior to 2:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on a Business Day in like funds as received prior to the end of such Business Day and otherwise the Administrative Agent will distribute such payment to such Lenders on the next succeeding Business Day.  Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (subject to accrual of interest and Fees for the period of such extension), except that in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, if the extension would cause the payment to be made in the next following calendar month, then such payment shall instead be made on the next preceding Business Day.  Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, all computations of interest and fees shall be made on the basis of actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days, except with respect to computation of interest on Base Rate Loans, which shall be calculated based on a year of 365 or 366 days, as appropriate.  Interest shall accrue from and include the date of borrowing, but exclude the date of payment.(b)    Allocation of Payments After Event of Default.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Credit Agreement to the contrary, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and upon the exercise of remedies in accordance with Section 9.2, all amounts collected or received on or in respect of the Obligations (or other amounts owing under the Credit Documents or other documentation in respect of the Obligations in connection therewith) shall be paid over or delivered as follows:FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees) of the Administrative Agent in connection with enforcing the rights and remedies of the Lenders under the Credit Documents made with respect thereto;SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such under the Credit Documents;THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) of each of the Lenders hereunder in connection with enforcing its rights under the Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to the Obligations owing to such Lender;FOURTH, to the payment of all accrued interest and fees on or in respect of the Obligations;FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Obligations hereunder (including the payment or cash collateralization of the outstanding LOC 55Obligations), and including with respect to any Swap Contract or Treasury Management Agreement, any other payments due under such Swap Contract or Treasury Management Agreement and any interest accrued thereon;SIXTH, to all other Obligations hereunder and other obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Credit Documents otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses “FIRST” through “FIFTH” above; andSEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to the Borrower.In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category; and (ii) except as otherwise provided, the Lenders shall receive amounts ratably in accordance with their respective pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Obligations held by such Lenders bears to the aggregate amount of the Obligations then outstanding) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses “THIRD”, “FOURTH”, “FIFTH” and “SIXTH” above; and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause “FIFTH” above are attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a cash collateral account and applied (A) first, to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B) then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of the types described in clauses “FOURTH”, “FIFTH” and “SIXTH” above in the manner provided in this Section 3.15(b).(c)    Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Percentage.  If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Borrower or for any other reason, the Borrower or the Lenders determine that (i) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate at the time so calculated and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Lender), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period.  This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, under Section 2.6(a)(iii), 2.6(f) or 3.1 or under Section 9.  The Borrower’s obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder, so long as such inaccuracy is discovered earlier than the date that is one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement and the Commitments hereunder.3.16    Evidence of Debt.(a)    Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing each Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Credit Agreement.  Each Lender will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of its account or accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts from time to time, as necessary.    56(b)    The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 11.3(c), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, type and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from or for the account of any Credit Party and each Lender’s share thereof.  The Administrative Agent will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the preceding sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as necessary.(c)    The entries made in the accounts, Register and subaccounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.16 (and, if consistent with the entries of the Administrative Agent, subsection (a)) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Credit Parties therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain any such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Credit Parties to repay the Obligations and other amounts owing to such Lender.3.17    Certain Limitations.(a)    If any Lender requests compensation or indemnification from the Borrower under Section 3.6, 3.9 or 3.11, then such Lender will agree to use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such change, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.(b)    If any Lender requests compensation or indemnification from the Borrower under Section 3.6, 3.9 or 3.12 more than ninety (90) days after the Lender had knowledge of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the compensation or indemnification, the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse the Lender for amounts incurred prior to the date on which the Borrower receives such demand for compensation or indemnification, except that, in the case of requests for compensation or indemnification from the Borrower under Section 3.6 or 3.9, if the Change in Law giving rise to such compensation or indemnification is retroactive, then the 90 day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.3.18    Defaulting Lenders.(a)    Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:(i)    Waivers and Amendments.  That Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Credit Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 11.6.(ii)    Reallocation of Payments.  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 9 or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.2), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts 57owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender hereunder; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, to be held as Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Credit Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Credit Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Credit Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Credit Agreement; and eighth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or LOC Borrowings in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or LOC Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LOC Borrowings owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LOC Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Lender.  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 3.18(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  (iii)    Certain Fees.  That Defaulting Lender (x) shall not be entitled to receive any unused fee pursuant to Section 3.5(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender) and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive Standby Letter of Credit Fees as provided in Section 2.6(f). (iv)    Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure.  During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans pursuant to Sections 2.1, 2.4, 2.6 or 2.7 the “Revolving Commitment Percentage” of each non-Defaulting Lender shall be computed without giving effect to the Revolving Commitment of that Defaulting Lender; provided, that, (i) each such reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Default exists; and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) the Revolving Commitment of that non-Defaulting Lender minus (2) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of that Lender. (b)    Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Lender agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein 58(which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Revolving Commitment Percentages (without giving effect to Section 3.18(a)(iv)), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.3.19    Cash Collateral.(a)    Certain Credit Support Events.  (i) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender (A) if the Issuing Lender has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an LOC Borrowing, or (B) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any LOC Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all LOC Obligations.  (ii)  At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 3.18(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).  (iii)     If the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower at any time that the Outstanding Amount of all LOC Obligations at such time exceeds 105% of the Letter of Credit Sublimit then in effect, then, within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the LOC Obligations in an amount equal to the amount by which the Outstanding Amount of all LOC Obligations exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit.(iv)    The Administrative Agent may, at any time and from time to time after the initial deposit of Cash Collateral, request that additional Cash Collateral be provided in order to protect against the results of exchange rate fluctuations.(b)    Grant of Security Interest.  All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Wells Fargo Bank.  The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grant to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders (including the Swingline Lender), and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 3.19(c).  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.    59(c)    Application.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Credit Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 3.19 or Sections 2.1, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7, 3.18 or 9.2 in respect of Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific LOC Obligations, Swingline Loans, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein. (d)    Release.  Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 11.3(b)(vi))) or (ii) the Administrative Agent’s good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided, however, (x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Credit Party shall not be released during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default (and following application as provided in this Section 3.19 may be otherwise applied in accordance with Section 9.2), and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, as applicable, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.SECTION 4GUARANTY4.1    The Guaranty.Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each Lender and each Affiliate of a Lender that enters into a Swap Contract or a Treasury Management Agreement with any Credit Party or any Subsidiary, and the Administrative Agent, as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt payment of the Obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the terms thereof.  The Guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the Obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary co

Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against the Borrower or any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this Section 4 until such time as the Lenders (and any Affiliates of Lenders entering into Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements) have been paid in full in respect of all Obligations, all Commitments under this Credit Agreement have been terminated and no Person or Governmental Authority shall have any right to request any return or reimbursement of funds from the Lenders in connection with monies received under the Credit Documents, Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements between any Credit Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender.

and(g)    any law or regulation of any jurisdiction or any event affecting any term of a guaranteed obligation.With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any other holder of the Obligations exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of the Credit Documents or any other document relating to the Obligations, or against any other Person 61under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Obligations (including, without limitation, any rights under Sections 26-7, 26-8 or 26-9 of the North Carolina General Statutes).4.3    Reinstatement.The obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 4 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.4.4    Certain Additional Waivers.Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of recourse to security for the Obligations, except through the exercise of rights of subrogation pursuant to Section 4.2 and through the exercise of rights of contribution pursuant to Section 4.6.4.5    Remedies.The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, the Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 9.2 (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said Section 9.2) for purposes of Section 4.1 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), the Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section 4.1.4.6    Rights of Contribution.The Guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that, if any Guarantor shall make an Excess Payment (as defined below), such Guarantor shall have a right of contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s Contribution Share (as defined below) of such Excess Payment.  The payment obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 4.6 shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of the Obligations, and none of the Guarantors shall exercise any right or remedy under this Section 4.6 against any other Guarantor until payment and satisfaction in full of all of Obligations.  For purposes of this Section 4.6, (a) “Guaranteed Obligations” shall mean any obligations arising under the other provisions of this Section 4; (b) “Excess Payment” shall mean the amount paid by any Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) “Pro Rata Share” shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect of any payment of Guaranteed Obligations, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such payment of Guaranteed Obligations of (i) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by wh

 Payment shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the date of such Excess Payment and the financial information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such Excess Payment.  This Section 4.6 shall not be deemed to affect any right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution that any Guarantor may have under applicable Law against the Borrower in respect of any payment of Guaranteed Obligations.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights of contribution against any Guarantor shall terminate from and after such time, if ever, that such Guarantor shall be relieved of its obligations pursuant to Section 8.4.4.7    Guarantee of Payment; Continuing Guarantee.The guarantee in this Section 4 is a guaranty of payment and not of collection, is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Obligations whenever arising.SECTION 5CONDITIONS PRECEDENT5.1    Conditions to Closing.The obligation of the Lenders to enter into this Credit Agreement and to make the initial Extensions of Credit shall be subject to satisfaction of the following conditions (in form and substance acceptable to the Lenders):(a)    Executed Credit Documents.

(A)    in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and the related Loans at the time owing to it or in the 89case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and(B)    in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single assignee (or to an assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met. (ii)    Proportionate Amounts.  Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s Loans and Commitments, and rights and obligations with respect thereto, assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not (A) apply to the Swingline Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of Swingline Loans or (B) prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations in respect of its Revolving Commitment (and the related Revolving Loans thereunder) on a non-pro rata basis;(iii)    Required Consents.  No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:(A)    the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof;(B)    the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of any Revolving Commitment if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender with a Commitment in respect of the Commitment subject to such assignment, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender; and(C)    the consent of the Issuing Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment that increases the obligation of the assignee to participate in exposure under one or more Letters of Credit (whether or not then outstanding); and(D)    the consent of the Swingline Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment in respect of Revolving Loans and Revolving Commitments.90(iv)    Assignment and Assumption.  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment.  The assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.(v)    No Assignment to Certain Persons.  No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or (C) to a natural person.(vi)    Certain Additional Payments.  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Credit Agreement until such compliance occurs.Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Credit Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Credit Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Credit Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.8, 3.11, 3.12, 11.5 and 11.9 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment).  Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Credit Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Credit Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.(c)    Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and LOC Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  91The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Credit Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  (d)    Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender’s participations in LOC Obligations and/or Swingline Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Credit Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the other Lenders and the Issuing Lender shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Credit Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in clauses (i) through (viii) of Section 11.6(a) that affects such Participant.  Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.6, 3.9, 3.11 and 3.12 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.2 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.14 as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Credit Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Credit Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. (e)    Limitation on Participant Rights.  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.6, 3.9, 3.11 or 3.12 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower prior written consent, and such Participant also shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.11 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.11 as though it were a Lender.92(f)    Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Credit Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.(g)    Resignation as Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender after Assignment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Wells Fargo Bank assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Wells Fargo Bank may, (i) upon thirty (30) days’ notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as Issuing Lender and/or (ii) upon thirty (30) days’ notice to the Borrower, resign as Swingline Lender.  In the event of any such resignation as Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders (with any such Lender’s consent) a successor Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Wells Fargo Bank as Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, as the case may be.  If Wells Fargo Bank resigns as Issuing Lender, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Issuing Lender hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as Issuing Lender and all LOC Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.6(a)).  If Wells Fargo Bank resigns as Swingline Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swingline Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swingline Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.7.  Upon the appointment of a successor Issuing Lender and/or Swingline Lender, (1) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, and (2) the successor Issuing Lender shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to Wells Fargo Bank to effectively assume the obligations of Wells Fargo Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit.11.4    No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no course of dealing between the Administrative Agent or any Lender and any of the Credit Parties shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder.  The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Administrative Agent or any Lender would otherwise have.  No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle the Credit Parties to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.11.5    Expenses; Indemnification; Damage Waiver.(a)    Costs and Expenses.  The Credit Parties shall pay (i) all reasonable out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates (including reasonable documented fees, charges and legal expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents not to 93exceed the limitations set forth in the Engagement Letter with amounts to be paid on the Closing Date, or any amendments, modifications or waivers of any of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), any enforcement, investigation, litigation, proceeding, or preparation of a defense in connection therewith), (ii) all reasonable out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Lender (including the fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights (A) in connection with this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, including its rights under this Section, or (B) in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.(b)    Indemnification by the Credit Parties.  The Credit Parties jointly and severally shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Lender, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including reasonable documented fees, charges and legal expenses incurred for any Indemnitee in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of the financing documentation, any enforcement, investigation, litigation, proceeding, or preparation of a defense in connection therewith by one external counsel to all such parties taken as a whole, and, in the case of a conflict of interest, one additional external counsel to the affected parties taken as a whole (and, if necessary, of one local counsel representing all such parties in any jurisdiction)), and shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee from all fees and time charges and disbursements for attorneys who may be employees of any Indemnitee, incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by any Credit Party arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the administration of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents (including in respect of any matters addressed in Section 3.11), (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Lender to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by a Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to a Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by any Credit Party, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from a claim brought by any Credit Party against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee’s obligations hereunder or under any other Credit Document, if such Credit Party has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.(c)    Reimbursement by Lenders.  To the extent that the Credit Parties for any reason fail to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by them to the 94Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the Swingline Lender, the Issuing Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Swingline Lender, the Issuing Lender or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Lender in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Swingline Lender or Issuing Lender in connection with such capacity.  The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 3.14.(d)    Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, no Credit Party shall assert, and each Credit Party hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.  No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.(e)    Payments.
