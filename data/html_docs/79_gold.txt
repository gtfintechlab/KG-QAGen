Administrative Agent shall provide such quoted rate to the Borrower on the date of such request or as soon as possible thereafter.
 
(c)                                  Funding of Revolving Loans.  Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Revolving Borrowing under the immediately preceding subsection (b), the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the proposed borrowing.  Each Revolving Lender shall deposit an amount equal to the Revolving Loan to be made by such Revolving Lender to the Borrower with the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office, in immediately available funds not later than 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the date of such proposed Revolving Loans.  Subject to fulfillment of all applicable conditions set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall make available to the Borrower in the account specified in the Disbursement Instruction Agreement, not later than 1:00 p.m. Eastern time on the date of the requested borrowing of Revolving Loans, the proceeds of such amounts received by the Administrative Agent.

(b)                                 Terms of Letters of Credit.  At the time of issuance, the amount, form, terms and conditions of each Letter of Credit, and of any drafts or acceptances thereunder, shall be subject to approval by the applicable Issuing Bank and the Borrower.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may (i) the expiration date of any Letter of Credit extend beyond the date that is thirty (30) days prior to the Revolving Termination Date, or (ii) any Letter of Credit have an initial duration in excess of one year; provided, however, a Letter of Credit may contain a provision providing for the automatic extension of the expiration date in the absence of a notice of non-renewal from the applicable Issuing Bank but in no event shall any such provision permit the extension of the expiration date of such Letter of Credit beyond the date that is thirty (30) days prior to the Revolving Termination Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Letter of Credit may, as a result of its express terms or as the result of the effect of an automatic extension provision, have an expiration date of not more than one year beyond the Revolving Termination

Date (any such Letter of Credit being referred to as an Extended Letter of Credit), so long as the Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent for its benefit and the benefit of the Issuing Bank that issued such Letter of Credit and the Revolving Lenders no later than 30 days prior to the Revolving Termination Date, Cash Collateral for such Letter of Credit for deposit into the Letter of Credit Collateral Account in an amount equal to the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit; provided, that the obligations of the Borrower under this Section in respect of such Extended Letters of Credit shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in effect until no such Extended Letters of Credit remain outstanding.  If the Borrower fails to provide Cash Collateral with respect to any Extended Letter of Credit by the date 30 days prior to the Revolving Termination Date, such failure shall be treated as a drawing under such Extended Letter of Credit (in an amount equal to the maximum Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit), which shall be reimbursed (or participations therein funded) by the Revolving Lenders in accordance with the immediately following subsections (i) and (j), with the proceeds being utilized to provide Cash Collateral for such Letter of Credit.  The initial Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit shall be at least $500,000 (or such lesser amount as may be acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower).
 
(c)                                  Requests for Issuance of Letters of Credit.  The Borrower shall give the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent written notice at least five (5) Business Days prior to the requested date of issuance of a Letter of Credit, such notice to describe in reasonable detail the proposed terms of such Letter of Credit and the nature of the transactions or obligations proposed to be supported by such Letter of Credit, and in any event shall set forth with respect to such Letter of Credit the proposed (i) initial Stated Amount, (ii) beneficiary, and (iii) expiration date. The Borrower shall also execute and deliver such customary applications and agreements for standby letters of credit, and other forms as requested from time to time by the applicable Issuing Bank.  Provided the Borrower has given the notice prescribed by the first sentence of this subsection and delivered such applications and agreements referred to in the preceding sentence, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the satisfaction of any applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2., the applicable Issuing Bank shall issue the requested Letter of Credit on the requested date of issuance for the benefit of the stipulated beneficiary but in no event shall such Issuing Bank be required to issue the requested Letter of Credit prior to the date five (5) Business Days following the date after which such Issuing Bank has received all of the items required to be delivered to it under this subsection.  No Issuing Bank shall at any time issue any Letter of Credit if such issuance would conflict with, or cause such Issuing Bank or any Revolving Lender to exceed any limits imposed by, any Applicable Law.  References herein to issue and derivations thereof with respect to Letters of Credit shall also include extensions or modifications of any outstanding Letters of Credit, unless the context otherwise requires.  Upon the written request of the Borrower, the applicable Issuing Bank shall deliver to the Borrower a copy of each issued Letter of Credit issued by it within a reasonable time after the date of issuance thereof.  To the extent any term of a Letter of Credit Document is inconsistent with a term of any Loan Document, the term of such Loan Document shall control.
 
(d)                                 Reimbursement Obligations.  Upon receipt by an Issuing Bank from the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit of any demand for payment under such Letter of Credit, such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of the amount to be paid by such Issuing Bank as a result of such demand and the date on which payment is to be made by such Issuing Bank to such beneficiary in respect of such demand; provided, however, that such Issuing Banks failure to give, or delay in giving, such notice shall not discharge the Borrower in any respect from the applicable Reimbursement Obligation.  The Borrower hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay and reimburse each Issuing Bank for the amount of each demand for payment under each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank at or prior to the date on which payment is to be made by such Issuing Bank to the beneficiary thereunder, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind.  Upon receipt by an Issuing Bank of any payment in respect of any Reimbursement Obligation, such 
 
31





 
Issuing Bank shall promptly pay to each Revolving Lender that has acquired a participation therein under the second sentence of the immediately following subsection (i) such Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage of such payment.
 
(e)                                  Manner of Reimbursement.  Upon its receipt of a notice referred to in the immediately preceding subsection (d), the Borrower shall advise the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank whether or not the Borrower intends to borrow hereunder to finance its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank for the amount of the related demand for payment and, if it does, the Borrower shall submit a timely request for such borrowing as provided in the applicable provisions of this Agreement.  If the Borrower fails to so advise the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank, or if the Borrower fails to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit by the date of such payment, the failure of which such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, then (i) if the applicable conditions contained in Article V. would permit the making of Revolving Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a borrowing of Revolving Loans (which shall be Base Rate Loans) in an amount equal to the unpaid Reimbursement Obligation and the Administrative Agent shall give each Revolving Lender prompt notice of the amount of the Revolving Loan to be made available to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern time and (ii) if such conditions would not permit the making of Revolving Loans, the provisions of subsection (j) of this Section shall apply.  The limitations set forth in the second sentence of Section 2.1.(a) shall not apply to any borrowing of Base Rate Loans under this subsection.
 
(f)                                   Effect of Letters of Credit on Revolving Commitments.  Upon the issuance by an Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit and until such Letter of Credit shall have expired or been cancelled, the Revolving Commitment of each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to be utilized for all purposes of this Agreement in an amount equal to the product of (i) such Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage and (ii) the sum of (A) the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit plus (B) any related Reimbursement Obligations then outstanding.
 
(g)                                  Issuing Banks Duties Regarding Letters of Credit; Unconditional Nature of Reimbursement Obligations.  In examining documents presented in connection with drawings under Letters of Credit issued and making payments under such Letters of Credit issued by an Issuing Bank against such documents, such Issuing Bank shall only be required to use the same standard of care as it uses in connection with examining documents presented in connection with drawings under letters of credit in which it has not sold participations and making payments under such letters of credit.  The Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, none of the Issuing Banks, Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders shall be responsible for, and the Borrowers obligations in respect of Letters of Credit shall not be affected in any manner by, (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effects of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of or any drawing honored under any Letter of Credit even if such document should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit, or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, facsimile, electronic mail, telecopy or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit, or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit, or of the proceeds of any drawing under any Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control 
 
32





 
of the Issuing Banks, Administrative Agent or the Lenders.  None of the above shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of any of the Issuing Banks or Administrative Agents rights or powers hereunder.  Any action taken or omitted to be taken by an Issuing Bank under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment), shall not create against such Issuing Bank any liability to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender.  In this connection, the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any drawing made under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, and to repay any Revolving Loan made pursuant to the second sentence of the immediately preceding subsection (e), shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and any other applicable Letter of Credit Document under all circumstances whatsoever, including without limitation, the following circumstances: (A) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit Document or any term or provisions therein; (B) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the Letter of Credit Documents; (C) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which the Borrower may have at any time against such Issuing Bank, any other Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or in the Letter of Credit Documents or any unrelated transaction; (D) any breach of contract or dispute between the Borrower, such Issuing Bank, and any other Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person; (E) any demand, statement or any other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein or made in connection therewith being untrue or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever; (F) any non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; (G) payment by such Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate which does not strictly comply with the terms of the applicable Letter of Credit; and (H) any other act, omission to act, delay or circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable defense to or discharge of the Borrowers Reimbursement Obligations.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section or Section 12.9., but not in limitation of the Borrowers unconditional obligation to reimburse each Issuing Bank for any drawing made under a Letter of Credit issued by it as provided in this Section and to repay any Revolving Loan made pursuant to the second sentence of the immediately preceding subsection (e), the Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in respect of any liability incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender arising solely out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender in respect of a Letter of Credit as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section, nothing in this Section shall affect any rights the Borrower may have with respect to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit.
 
(h)                                 Amendments, Etc.  The issuance by an Issuing Bank of any amendment, supplement or other modification to any Letter of Credit issued by it shall be subject to the same conditions applicable under this Agreement to the issuance of new Letters of Credit (including, without limitation, that the request therefor be made through the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent), and no such amendment, supplement or other modification shall be issued unless either (i) the respective Letter of Credit affected thereby would have complied with such conditions had it originally been issued hereunder in such amended, supplemented or modified form or (ii) the Administrative Agent and the Requisite Class Lenders of the Revolving Lenders (or all of the Revolving Lenders if required by Section 12.6.) shall have consented thereto.  In connection with any such amendment, supplement or other modification, the Borrower shall pay the fees, if any, payable under the last sentence of Section 3.5.(c).

(i)                                     Revolving Lenders Participation in Letters of Credit.  Immediately upon the issuance by an Issuing Bank of any Letter of Credit each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received from such Issuing Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation to the extent of such Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage of the liability of such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit and each Revolving Lender thereby shall absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably assume, as primary obligor and not as surety, and shall be unconditionally obligated to such Issuing Bank to pay and discharge when due, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the immediately following subsection (j) below, such Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage of such Issuing Banks liability under such Letter of Credit.  In addition, upon the making of each payment by a Revolving Lender to the Administrative Agent for the account of an Issuing Bank in respect of any Letter of Credit issued by it pursuant to the immediately following subsection (j), such Revolving Lender shall, automatically and without any further action on the part of such Issuing Bank, Administrative Agent or such Revolving Lender, acquire (i) a participation in an amount equal to such payment in the Reimbursement Obligation owing to such Issuing Bank by the Borrower in respect of such Letter of Credit and (ii) a participation in a percentage equal to such Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage in any interest or other amounts payable by the Borrower in respect of such Reimbursement Obligation (other than the Fees payable to such Issuing Bank pursuant to the second and the last sentences of Section 3.5.(c)).
 
(j)                                    Payment Obligation of Revolving Lenders.  Each Revolving Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Issuing Bank, on demand in immediately available funds in Dollars the amount of such Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage of each drawing paid by such Issuing Bank under each Letter of Credit issued by it to the extent such amount is not reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to the immediately preceding subsection (d); provided, however, that in respect of any drawing under any Letter of Credit, the maximum amount that any Revolving Lender shall be required to fund, whether as a Revolving Loan or as a participation, shall not exceed such Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage of such drawing except as otherwise provided in Section 3.9.(d).  If the notice referenced in the second sentence of Section 2.3.(e) is received by a Revolving Lender not later than 10:00 a.m. Eastern time, then such Revolving Lender shall make such payment available to the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. Eastern time on the date of demand therefor; otherwise, such payment shall be made available to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on the next succeeding Business Day.  Each Revolving Lenders obligation to make such payments to the Administrative Agent under this subsection, and the Administrative Agents right to receive the same for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, shall be absolute, irrevocable and unconditional and shall not be affected in any way by any circumstance whatsoever, including without limitation, (i) the failure of any other Revolving Lender to make its payment under this subsection, (ii) the financial condition of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, (iii) the existence of any Default or Event of Default, including any Event of Default described in Section 10.1.(e) or (f), (iv) the termination of the Revolving Commitments or (v) the delivery of Cash Collateral in respect of any Extended Letter of Credit.  Each such payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or deduction whatsoever.

34





 
of Credit issued hereunder.  The failure of any Issuing Bank to perform its requirements under this subsection shall not relieve any Revolving Lender from its obligations under the immediately preceding subsection (j).
 
(l)                                     Extended Letters of Credit.  Each Revolving Lender confirms that its obligations under the immediately preceding subsections (i) and (j) shall be reinstated in full and apply if the delivery of any Cash Collateral in respect of an Extended Letter of Credit is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise.

(b)                                 Procedure for Borrowing Swingline Loans.  The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender notice pursuant to a Notice of Swingline Borrowing or telephonic notice of each borrowing of a Swingline Loan.  Each Notice of Swingline Borrowing shall be delivered to the Swingline Lender no later than 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the proposed date of such borrowing.  Any telephonic notice shall include all information to be specified in a written Notice of Swingline Borrowing and shall be promptly confirmed in writing by the Borrower pursuant to a Notice of Swingline Borrowing sent to the Swingline Lender by telecopy on the same day of the giving of such telephonic notice.  Not later than 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on the date of the requested Swingline Loan and subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 5.2. for such borrowing, the Swingline Lender will make the proceeds of such Swingline Loan available to the Borrower in Dollars, in immediately available funds, at the account specified by the Borrower in the Notice of Swingline Borrowing.

the date of such prepayment.  The Swingline Loans shall, in addition to this Agreement, be evidenced by the Swingline Note.
 
(e)                                  Repayment and Participations of Swingline Loans.  The Borrower agrees to repay each Swingline Loan within one Business Day of demand therefor by the Swingline Lender and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days after the date such Swingline Loan was made; provided, that the proceeds of a Swingline Loan may not be used to pay a Swingline Loan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall repay the entire outstanding principal amount of, and all accrued but unpaid interest on, the Swingline Loans on the Swingline Maturity Date (or such earlier date as the Swingline Lender and the Borrower may agree in writing).  In lieu of demanding repayment of any outstanding Swingline Loan from the Borrower, the Swingline Lender may, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably directs the Swingline Lender to act on its behalf), request a borrowing of Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans from the Revolving Lenders in an amount equal to the principal balance of such Swingline Loan.  The amount limitations contained in the second sentence of Section 2.1.(a) shall not apply to any borrowing of such Revolving Loans made pursuant to this subsection.  The Swingline Lender shall give notice to the Administrative Agent of any such borrowing of Revolving Loans not later than 10:00 a.m. Eastern time at least one Business Day prior to the proposed date of such borrowing.  Promptly after receipt of such notice of borrowing of Revolving Loans from the Swingline Lender under the immediately preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the proposed borrowing.  Not later than 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the proposed date of such borrowing, each Revolving Lender will make available to the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office for the account of the Swingline Lender, in immediately available funds, the proceeds of the Revolving Loan to be made by such Revolving Lender.  The Administrative Agent shall pay the proceeds of such Revolving Loans to the Swingline Lender, which shall apply such proceeds to repay such Swingline Loan.  If the Revolving Lenders are prohibited from making Revolving Loans required to be made under this subsection for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation, the occurrence of any of the Defaults or Events of Default described in Sections 10.1.(e) or (f), each Revolving Lender shall purchase from the Swingline Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation to the extent of such Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment Percentage of such Swingline Loan, by directly purchasing a participation in such Swingline Loan in such amount and paying the proceeds thereof to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender in Dollars and in immediately available funds.  A Revolving Lenders obligation to purchase such a participation in a Swingline Loan shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including without limitation, (i) any claim of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender or any other Person may have or claim against the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or any other Person whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuation of a Default or Event of Default (including without limitation, any of the Defaults or Events of Default described in Sections 10.1. (e) or (f)), or the termination of any Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment, (iii) the existence (or alleged existence) of an event or condition which has had or could have a Material Adverse Effect, (iv) any breach of any Loan Document by the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Borrower or any other Loan Party, or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.  If such amount is not in fact made available to the Swingline Lender by any Revolving Lender, the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender, together with accrued interest thereon for each day from the date of demand thereof, at the Federal Funds Rate.  If such Revolving Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Swingline Lenders demand therefor, and until such time as such Revolving Lender makes the required payment, the Swingline Lender shall be deemed to continue to have outstanding Swingline Loans in the amount of such unpaid participation obligation for all purposes of the Loan Documents (other than those provisions requiring the other Revolving Lenders to purchase a participation therein).  Further, such Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments made of principal and interest on its Revolving Loans, and any other amounts due it hereunder, to the Swingline Lender to fund Swingline 
 
36





 
Loans in the amount of the participation in Swingline Loans that such Revolving Lender failed to purchase pursuant to this Section until such amount has been purchased (as a result of such assignment or otherwise).
 
Section 2.5.  Rates and Payment of Interest on Loans.
 
(a)                                 Rates.  The Borrower promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by such Lender for the period from and including the date of the making of such Loan to but excluding the date such Loan shall be paid in full, at the following per annum rates:
 
(i)                                     in the case of a Revolving Loan, during such periods as such Revolving Loan is (x) a Base Rate Loan, at the Base Rate (as in effect from time to time), plus the Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans and (y) a LIBOR Loan, at LIBOR for such Revolving Loan for the Interest Period therefor, plus the Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans that are LIBOR Loans; and
 
(ii)                                  in the case of a Term Loan, during such periods as such Term Loan is (x) a Base Rate Loan, at the Base Rate (as in effect from time to time), plus the Applicable Margin for Term Loans that are Base Rate Loans and (y) a LIBOR Loan, at LIBOR for such Term Loan for the Interest Period therefor, plus the Applicable Margin for Term Loans that are LIBOR Loans.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, while an Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Class of Lenders, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, interest at the Post-Default Rate on the outstanding principal amount of each Class of Loans made by such Lender, on the outstanding amount of all Swingline Loans, on all Reimbursement Obligations, respectively, and on any other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes held by such Lenders to or for the account of such Lenders (including without limitation, accrued but unpaid interest to the extent permitted under Applicable Law).
 
(b)                                 Payment of Interest. All accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Loan shall be payable (i) monthly in arrears on the first day of each month, commencing with the first full calendar month occurring after the Effective Date and (ii) on any date on which the principal balance of such Loan is due and payable in full (whether at maturity, due to acceleration or otherwise).  Interest payable at the Post-Default Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand.  All determinations by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding on the Lenders and the Borrower for all purposes, absent manifest error.
 
Section 2.6.  Number of Interest Periods.
 
There may be no more than (a) eight different Interest Periods for Revolving Loans that are LIBOR Loans outstanding at the same time and (b) four different Interest Periods for Term Loans that are LIBOR Loans outstanding at the same time.

(b)                                 Mandatory.
 
(i)                                     Commitment Overadvance.  If at any time the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans, together with the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities, exceeds the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments, the Borrower shall immediately upon demand pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Revolving Lenders, the amount of such excess.
 
(ii)                                  Application of Mandatory Prepayments.  Amounts paid under the preceding subsection (b)(i) shall be applied to pay all amounts of principal outstanding on the Revolving Loans and any Reimbursement Obligations pro rata in accordance with Section 3.2. and if any Letters of Credit are outstanding at such time, the remainder, if any, shall be deposited into the Letter of Credit Collateral Account for application to any Reimbursement Obligations.  If the Borrower is required to pay any outstanding LIBOR Loans by reason of this Section prior to the end of the applicable Interest Period therefor, the Borrower shall pay all amounts due under Section 4.4.
 
Section 2.9.  Continuation.
 
So long as no Default or Event of Default exists, the Borrower may on any Business Day, with respect to any LIBOR Loan, elect to maintain such LIBOR Loan or any portion thereof as a LIBOR Loan by selecting a new Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan.  Each Continuation of LIBOR Loans of the same Class shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $2,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount, and each new Interest Period selected under this Section shall commence on the last day of the immediately preceding Interest Period.  Each selection of a new Interest Period shall be made by the Borrower giving to the Administrative Agent a Notice of Continuation not later than 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the third Business Day prior to the date of any such Continuation.  Such notice by the Borrower of a Continuation shall be by telecopy, electronic mail or other similar form of communication in the form of a Notice of Continuation, specifying (a) the proposed date of such Continuation, (b) the LIBOR Loans, Class and portions of such Loans subject to such Continuation and (c) the duration of the selected Interest Period, all of which shall be specified in such manner as is necessary to comply with all limitations on Loans outstanding hereunder.  Each Notice of Continuation shall be irrevocable by and binding on the Borrower once given.  Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Continuation, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender holding Loans being Continued of the proposed Continuation.  If the Borrower shall fail to select in a timely manner a new Interest Period for any LIBOR Loan in accordance with this Section, such Loan will automatically, on the last day of the current Interest Period therefor, continue as a LIBOR Loan with an Interest Period of one month; provided, however that if a Default or Event of Default exists, such Loan will automatically, on the last day of the current Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Loan notwithstanding the first sentence of Section 2.10. or the Borrowers failure to comply with any of the terms of such Section.

Section 2.13.  Extension of Revolving Termination Date.
 
The Borrower shall have the option, exercisable one time, to extend the current Revolving Termination Date by one year.  The Borrower may exercise such option only by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent at least 30 days but not more than 90 days prior to the current Revolving Termination Date, a written request for such extension (an Extension Request).  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders if it receives an Extension Request promptly upon receipt thereof.

Section 2.14.  Expiration Date of Letters of Credit Past Commitment Termination.
 
If on the date the Revolving Commitments are terminated or reduced to zero (whether voluntarily, by reason of the occurrence of an Event of Default or otherwise) there are any Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder and the aggregate Stated Amount of such Letters of Credit exceeds the balance of available funds on deposit in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account, then the Borrower shall, on such date, pay to the Administrative Agent, for its benefit and the benefit of the Revolving Lenders and the Issuing Banks, for deposit into the Letter of Credit Collateral Account, an amount of money equal to the amount of such excess.

Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, no Revolving Lender shall be required to make a Revolving Loan, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue a Letter of Credit and no reduction of the Revolving Commitments pursuant to Section 2.12. shall take effect, if immediately after the making of any such Loan, the issuance of such Letter of Credit or such reduction in the Revolving Commitments, the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans, together with the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities, would exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments at such time.
 
Section 2.16.  Increase in Commitments.
 
The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time (a) during the period beginning on the Effective Date to but excluding the Revolving Termination Date to request increases in the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments, and (b) during the period from the Effective Date to but excluding the Termination Date for the Term Loans, to request the making of additional Term Loans (the Additional Term Loans), in each case, by providing written notice to the Administrative Agent, which notice shall be irrevocable once given; provided, however, that after giving effect to any such increases of the Revolving Commitments and the making of Additional Term Loans, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments and the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans shall not exceed $2,200,000,000 (less the amount of any prepayments of the Term Loans).  Each such increase in the Revolving Commitments or borrowing of Additional Term Loans must be an aggregate minimum amount of $50,000,000 and integral multiples of $10,000,000 in excess thereof.  The Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower, shall manage all aspects of the syndication of such increase in the Revolving Commitments and/or the making of any Additional Term Loans, including decisions as to the selection of the existing Lenders and/or other banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders to be approached with respect to any such increase in the Revolving Commitments or making of Additional Term Loans and the allocations of any increase in the Revolving Commitments or making of Additional Term Loans among such existing Lenders and/or other banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders.  No Lender shall be obligated in any way whatsoever to increase its Revolving Commitment, to provide a new Revolving Commitment, or to make an Additional Term Loan, and any new Lender becoming a party to this Agreement in connection with any such requested increase of the Revolving Commitments or making of Additional Term Loans must be an Eligible Assignee.  If a new Revolving Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, or if any existing Revolving Lender is increasing its Revolving Commitment, such Lender shall on the date it becomes a Revolving Lender hereunder (or in the case of an existing Revolving Lender, increases its Revolving Commitment) (and as a condition thereto) purchase from the other Revolving Lenders its Revolving Commitment Percentage (determined with respect to the Revolving Lenders respective Revolving Commitments and after giving effect to the increase of Revolving Commitments) of any outstanding Revolving Loans, by making available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such other Revolving Lenders, in same day funds, an amount equal to (A) the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Revolving Loans to be purchased by such Lender, plus (B) the aggregate amount of payments previously made by the other Lenders under Section 2.3.(j) that have not been repaid, plus (C) interest accrued and unpaid to and as of such date on such portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Revolving Loans.  The Borrower shall pay to the Revolving Lenders amounts payable, if any, to such Revolving Lenders under Section 4.4. as a result of the prepayment of any such Revolving Loans.  Effecting any increase of the Revolving Commitments or making of Additional Term Loans under this Section is subject to the following conditions precedent:  (x) no Default or Event of Default shall be in existence on the effective date of such increase of the Revolving Commitments or making of Additional Term Loans, (y) the 
 
41





 
representations and warranties made or deemed made by the Borrower or any other Loan Party in any Loan Document to which such Loan Party is a party shall be true and correct in all material respects (except in the case of a representation or warranty qualified by materiality, in which case such representation or warranty shall be true and correct in all respects) on the effective date of any such increase in the Revolving Commitments or making of Additional Term Loans except to the extent that such representations and warranties expressly relate solely to an earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects (except in the case of a representation or warranty qualified by materiality, in which case such representation or warranty shall have been true in all respects) on and as of such earlier date) and except for changes in factual circumstances expressly permitted hereunder, and (z) the Administrative Agent shall have received each of the following, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent:  (i) if not previously delivered to the Administrative Agent, copies certified by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of (A) all corporate and other necessary action taken by the Borrower to authorize such increase of the Revolving Commitments or Additional Term Loans and (B) all corporate and other necessary action taken by each Guarantor authorizing the guaranty of such increase of the Revolving Commitments or Additional Term Loans; (ii) an opinion of counsel to the Borrower and the Guarantors, and addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders covering such matters as reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, and (iii)(A) new Revolving Notes executed by the Borrower, payable to any new Revolving Lenders and replacement Revolving Notes executed by the Borrower, payable to any existing Revolving Lenders increasing their Revolving Commitments, in the amount of such Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment at the time of the effectiveness of the applicable increase in the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments and/or (B) a new Term Note of the applicable Class of Term Loans made by such Term Loan Lender executed by the Borrower, payable to such new Term Loan Lenders, and replacement Term Notes of the applicable Class executed by the Borrower payable to such existing Term Loan Lenders making such Additional Term Loans of such Class, in each case, in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Term Loan Lenders Term Loan of the applicable Class at the time of the making of such Additional Term Loans (excluding, in the case of the preceding clauses (A) and (B), any Lender that has requested that it not receive Notes).  In connection with any increase in the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments or the making of the Additional Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.16., any Lender becoming a party hereto shall (1) execute such documents and agreements as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request and (2) in the case of any Lender that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States of America, provide to the Administrative Agent, its name, address, tax identification number and/or such other information as shall be necessary for the Administrative Agent to comply with know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation, the Patriot Act.
 
Section 2.17.  Funds Transfer Disbursements.
 
The Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to disburse the proceeds of any Loan made by the Lenders or any of their Affiliates pursuant to the Loan Documents as requested by an authorized representative of the Borrower to any of the accounts designated in the Disbursement Instruction Agreement.
 
ARTICLE III. PAYMENTS, FEES AND OTHER GENERAL PROVISIONS
 
Section 3.1.  Payments.
 
(a)                                 Payments by Borrower.  Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all payments of principal, interest, Fees and other amounts to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document shall be made in Dollars, in immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim (excluding Taxes required to be withheld pursuant to Section 3.10.), to the 
 
42





 
Administrative Agent at the Principal Office, not later than 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on the date on which such payment shall become due (each such payment made after such time on such due date to be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day).  Subject to Section 10.5., the Borrower shall, at the time of making each payment under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, specify to the Administrative Agent the amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied.  Each payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of a Lender under this Agreement or any Note shall be paid to such Lender by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the wiring instructions provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent from time to time, for the account of such Lender at the applicable Lending Office of such Lender.  Each payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement shall be paid to the applicable Issuing Bank by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the wiring instructions provided by such Issuing Bank to the Administrative Agent from time to time, for the account of such Issuing Bank.  In the event the Administrative Agent fails to pay such amounts to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, (i) by 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the Business Day such funds are received by the Administrative Agent, if such amounts are received by 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on such date or (ii) by 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the Business Day following the date such funds are received by the Administrative Agent, if such amounts are received after 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on any Business Day, the Administrative Agent shall pay interest on such amount until paid at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.  If the due date of any payment under this Agreement or any other Loan Document would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day such date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest shall continue to accrue at the rate, if any, applicable to such payment for the period of such extension.
 
(b)                                 Presumptions Regarding Payments by Borrower.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of any of the Lenders or Issuing Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may (but shall not be obligated to), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders or applicable Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent on demand that amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

43





 
Revolving Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments in effect at the time such Revolving Loans were made, then such payment shall be applied to the Revolving Loans in such manner as shall result, as nearly as is practicable, in the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans being held by the Revolving Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments; (d) each payment of interest on a Class of Loans shall be made for the account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Class of Loans then due and payable to the respective Class of Lenders; (e) the Conversion and Continuation of Loans of a particular Class and Type (other than Conversions provided for by Section 4.1.) shall be made pro rata among the Lenders of such Class according to the amounts of their respective Loans of such Class and the then current Interest Period for each Lenders portion of each such Loan of such Type shall be coterminous; (f) the Revolving Lenders participation in, and payment obligations in respect of, Swingline Loans under Section 2.4., shall be in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitment Percentages; and (g) the Revolving Lenders participation in, and payment obligations in respect of, Letters of Credit under Section 2.3., shall be in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitment Percentages.  All payments of principal, interest, fees and other amounts in respect of the Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the Swingline Lender only (except to the extent any Revolving Lender shall have acquired a participating interest in any such Swingline Loan pursuant to Section 2.4.(e), in which case such payments shall be pro rata in accordance with such participating interests).

If a Lender shall obtain payment of any principal of, or interest on, any Loan made by it to the Borrower under this Agreement or shall obtain payment on any other Obligation owing by the Borrower or any other Loan Party through the exercise of any right of set-off, bankers lien, counterclaim or similar right or otherwise or through voluntary prepayments directly to a Lender, or other payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Loan Party to a Lender (other than any payment in respect of Specified Derivatives Obligations) not in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and such payment should be distributed in accordance with Section 3.2. or Section 10.5., such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by such Lender, direct interests in) the Loans made by the other Lenders or other Obligations owed to such other Lenders in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Lenders shall share the benefit of such payment (net of any reasonable expenses which may actually be incurred by such Lender in obtaining or preserving such benefit) in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.2. or Section 10.5., as applicable; provided, however, that with respect to any such voluntary prepayment directly to such Lender that is identified as payment for a certain Class of Loans, so long as no Event of Default exists, such Lender shall promptly purchase only from the other Lenders of the same Class participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by such Lender, direct interests in) the Loans of such Class made by the other Lenders of such Class in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Lenders of such Class shall share the benefit of such payment (net of any reasonable expenses which may actually be incurred by such Lender in obtaining or preserving such benefit) in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.2.  To such end, all the Lenders obtaining any such payment (including by purchase of any participation) shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if any such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored.  The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation (or direct interest) in the Loans (or if purchasing a participation (or direct interest) in a certain Class of Loans, in such Class of Loans) or other Obligations owed to such other Lenders may exercise all rights of set-off, bankers lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of Loans or such Class of Loans, as applicable, in the amount of such participation.  Nothing contained herein shall require any Lender to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Lender to exercise and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of the Borrower.

Section 3.4.  Several Obligations.
 
No Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make a Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender hereunder, and the failure of any Lender to make a Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by it hereunder shall not relieve the obligation of any other Lender to make any Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender.
 
Section 3.5.  Fees.
 
(a)                                 Closing Fee.  On the Effective Date, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and each Lender all loan fees as have been agreed to in writing by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
 
(b)                                 Facility Fees for Revolving Loans. During the period from the Effective Date to but excluding the Revolving Termination Date, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Revolving Lenders a facility fee equal to the daily aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments (whether or not utilized) times a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Facility Fee. Such fee shall be computed on a daily basis and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each January, April, July and October during the term of this Agreement and on the Revolving Termination Date or any earlier date of termination of the Revolving Commitments or reduction of the Revolving Commitments to zero.  The Borrower acknowledges that the fee payable hereunder is a bona fide commitment fee and is intended as reasonable compensation to the Revolving Lenders for committing to make funds available to the Borrower as described herein and for no other purposes.
 
(c)                                  Letter of Credit Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a letter of credit fee at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans that are LIBOR Loans times the daily average Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit for the period from and including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit (x) to and including the date such Letter of Credit expires or is cancelled or terminated or (y) to but excluding the date such Letter of Credit is drawn in full; provided, however, while any Event of Default exists, such letter of credit fee shall accrue at the Post-Default Rate.  In addition to such fees, the Borrower shall pay to the applicable Issuing Bank solely for its own account, a fronting fee in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by it equal to one-eighth of one percent (0.125%) of the initial Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit; provided, however, in no event shall the aggregate amount of such fee in respect of any Letter of Credit be less than $1,000. The fees provided for in this subsection shall be nonrefundable and payable, in the case of the fee provided for in the first sentence, in arrears (i) quarterly on the first day of January, April, July and October, (ii) on the Revolving Termination Date, (iii) on the date the Revolving Commitments are terminated or reduced to zero and (iv) thereafter from time to time on demand of the Administrative Agent and in the case of the fee provided for in the second sentence, at the time of issuance of such Letter of Credit.  The Borrower shall pay directly to each Issuing Bank from time to time on demand all commissions, charges, costs and expenses in the amounts customarily charged or incurred by such Issuing Bank from time to time in like circumstances with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit by such Issuing Bank or any other transaction relating thereto.
 
(d)                                 Extension Fee.  If the Borrower exercises its right to extend the Revolving Termination Date in accordance with Section 2.13., the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a fee equal to three-twentieths of one percent (0.15%) of the amount of such Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment (whether or not utilized).  Such fee shall be due and 
 
45





 
payable in full on the date the Administrative Agent receives the Extension Request pursuant to such Section.
 
(e)                                  Administrative and Other Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay the administrative and other fees of the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arrangers as provided in the Fee Letter and as may be otherwise agreed to in writing from time to time by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
 
Section 3.6.  Computations.
 
Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, any accrued interest on any Loan, any Fees or any other Obligations due hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed.
 
Section 3.7.  Usury.
 
In no event shall the amount of interest due or payable on the Loans or other Obligations exceed the maximum rate of interest allowed by Applicable Law and, if any such payment is paid by the Borrower or any other Loan Party or received by any Lender, then such excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the Borrower shall notify the respective Lender in writing that the Borrower elects to have such excess sum returned to it forthwith.  It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the Borrower not pay and the Lenders not receive, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be lawfully paid by the Borrower under Applicable Law.  The parties hereto hereby agree and stipulate that the only charge imposed upon the Borrower for the use of money in connection with this Agreement is and shall be the interest specifically described in Section 2.5.(a)(i) and (ii) and, with respect to Swingline Loans, in Section 2.4.(c).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto further agree and stipulate that all agency fees, syndication fees, facility fees, closing fees, letter of credit fees, underwriting fees, default charges, late charges, funding or breakage charges, increased cost charges, attorneys fees and reimbursement for costs and expenses paid by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to third parties or for damages incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in each case, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, are charges made to compensate the Administrative Agent or any such Lender for underwriting or administrative services and costs or losses performed or incurred, and to be performed or incurred, by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with this Agreement and shall under no circumstances be deemed to be charges for the use of money.  All charges other than charges for the use of money shall be fully earned and nonrefundable when due.
 
Section 3.8.  Statements of Account.
 
The Administrative Agent will account to the Borrower monthly with a statement of Loans, accrued interest and Fees, charges and payments made pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and such account rendered by the Administrative Agent shall be deemed conclusive upon the Borrower absent manifest error.  The failure of the Administrative Agent to deliver such a statement of accounts shall not relieve or discharge the Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder.
 
Section 3.9.  Defaulting Lenders.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law:
 
46





 
(a)                                 Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definitions of Requisite Class Lenders and Requisite Lenders and in Section 12.6.
 
(b)                                 Defaulting Lender Waterfall.  Any payment of principal, interest, Fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article X. or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 12.3. shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks aggregate Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with subsection (e) below; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks future aggregate Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with subsection (e) below; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans of any Class or amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.3.(j) in respect of Letters of Credit (such amounts L/C Disbursements), in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Article V. were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of such Class of, and L/C Disbursements owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders of the applicable Class on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Class of, or L/C Disbursements owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans of such Class, and, as applicable, all funded and unfunded participations in Letter of Credit Liabilities and Swingline Loans, are held by the Revolving Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitment Percentages (determined without giving effect to the immediately following subsection (d)) and all Term Loans are held by the Term Loan Lenders pro rata as if there had been no Defaulting Lender that is a Term Loan Lender.  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 
(c)                                  Certain Fees.
 
(i)                                     No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Fee payable under Section 3.5.(b) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
 
47





 
(ii)                                  Each Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender shall be entitled to receive the Fee payable under Section 3.5.(c) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Revolving Commitment Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to the immediately following subsection (e).
 
(iii)                               With respect to any Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to the immediately preceding clauses (i) or (ii), the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender the portion of any such Fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lenders participation in Letter of Credit Liabilities or Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to the immediately following subsection (d), (y) pay to each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such Fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Banks or Swingline Lenders Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such Fee.
 
(d)                                 Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure.  In the case of a Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender, all or any part of such Defaulting Lenders participation in Letter of Credit Liabilities and Swingline Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders that are Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitment Percentages (determined without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment.  No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Revolving Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation.
 
(e)                                  Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Loans.
 
(i)                                     If the reallocation described in the immediately preceding subsection (d) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Lenders Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize each Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subsection.
 
(ii)                                  At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender, within 1 Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or a n Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks aggregate Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to the immediately preceding subsection (d) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the aggregate Fronting Exposure of the Issuing Banks with respect to Letters of Credit issued and outstanding at such time.
 
(iii)                               The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grant to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Banks, and agree to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the obligations of Defaulting Lenders that are Revolving Lenders to fund participations in respect of Letter of Credit Liabilities, to be applied pursuant to the immediately following clause (iv).  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash 
 
48





 
Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the aggregate Fronting Exposure of the Issuing Banks with respect to Letters of Credit issued and outstanding at such time, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).
 
(iv)                              Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the obligation of a Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender to fund participations in respect of Letter of Credit Liabilities (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
 
(v)                                 Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce the Issuing Banks aggregate Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this subsection following (x) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (y) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to the immediately preceding subsection (b), the Person providing Cash Collateral and the Issuing Banks may (but shall not be obligated to) agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations and provided further that to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by the Borrower, such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Loan Documents.
 
(f)                                   Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and solely in the case of a Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Banks, agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which, in the case of a Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender, may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause, as applicable, (i) the Revolving Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held pro rata by the Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitment Percentages (determined without giving effect to the immediately preceding subsection (d)) and (ii) the Term Loans to be held by the Term Loan Lenders pro rata as if there had been no Defaulting Lenders that are Term Loan Lenders, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to Fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
(g)                                  New Swingline Loans/Letters of Credit.  So long as any Revolving Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swingline Loan and (ii) no 
 
49





 
Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.
 
(h)                                 Purchase of Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment/Loans.  During any period that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower may, by the Borrower giving written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent, such Defaulting Lender and the other Lenders, demand that such Defaulting Lender assign its Revolving Commitment and Loans to an Eligible Assignee subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.5.(b).  No party hereto shall have any obligation whatsoever to initiate any such replacement or to assist in finding an Eligible Assignee.  In addition, any Lender who is not a Defaulting Lender may, but shall not be obligated, in its sole discretion, to acquire the face amount of all or a portion of such Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment and Loans via an assignment subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.5.(b).  In connection with any such assignment, such Defaulting Lender shall promptly execute all documents reasonably requested to effect such assignment, including an appropriate Assignment and Assumption and, notwithstanding Section 12.5.(b), shall pay to the Administrative Agent an assignment fee in the amount of $7,500.  The exercise by the Borrower of its rights under this Section shall be at the Borrowers sole cost and expense and at no cost or expense to the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders.
 
Section 3.10.  Taxes.
 
(a)                                 Issuing Bank.  For purposes of this Section, the term Lender includes each Issuing Bank and the term Applicable Law includes FATCA.
 
(b)                                 Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law.  If any Applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower or other applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
 
(c)                                  Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.  The Borrower and the other Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
 
(d)                                 Indemnification by the Borrower.  The Borrower and the other Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(e)                                  Indemnification by the Lenders.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to 
 
50





 
such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower or another Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.5. relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this subsection.  The provisions of this subsection shall continue to inure to the benefit of an Administrative Agent following its resignation or removal as Administrative Agent.
 
(f)                                   Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or any other Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, the Borrower or such other Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(g)                                  Status of Lenders.
 
(i)                                     Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in the immediately following clauses (ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D)) shall not be required if in the applicable Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
 
(ii)                                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
 
(A)                               any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), an electronic copy (or an original if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) of an executed IRS Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;

documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)                               if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(h)                                 Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this subsection (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental 

arty is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
(i)                                     Survival.  Each partys obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.

ARTICLE IV. YIELD PROTECTION, ETC.
 
Section 4.1.  Additional Costs; Capital Adequacy.
 
(a)                                 Capital Adequacy.  If any Lender determines that any Regulatory Change affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(b)                                 Additional Costs.  In addition to, and not in limitation of the immediately preceding subsection, the Borrower shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of a Lender from time to time such amounts as such Lender may determine to be necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs incurred by such Lender that it determines are attributable to its making or maintaining of any LIBOR Loans or its obligation to make or Continue, or Convert any Loans into, any LIBOR Loans hereunder, any reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in respect of any of such LIBOR Loans or such obligation or the maintenance by such Lender of capital in respect of its LIBOR Loans or its Commitments (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called Additional Costs), resulting from any Regulatory Change that:
 
(i)                                     changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in respect of any of such LIBOR Loans or its Commitments (other than Indemnified 

 or
 
(iii)                               imposes on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender.
 
(c)                                  Lenders Suspension of LIBOR Loans.  Without limiting the effect of the provisions of the immediately preceding subsections (a) and (b), if by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Lender either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Lender that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender that includes LIBOR Loans or (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets that it may hold, then, if such Lender 
 
54





 
so elects by notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the obligation of such Lender to make or Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 4.5. shall apply).
 
(d)                                 Additional Costs in Respect of Letters of Credit.  Without limiting the obligations of the Borrower under the preceding subsections of this Section (but without duplication), if as a result of any Regulatory Change or any risk-based capital guideline or other requirement heretofore or hereafter issued by any Governmental Authority there shall be imposed, modified or deemed applicable any Tax (other than Indemnified Taxes, Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and Connection Income Taxes), reserve, special deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement against or with respect to or measured by reference to Letters of Credit and the result shall be to increase the cost to an Issuing Bank of issuing (or any Revolving Lender of purchasing participations in) or maintaining its obligation hereunder to issue (or purchase participations in) any Letter of Credit or reduce any amount receivable by such Issuing Bank or any Revolving Lender hereunder in respect of any Letter of Credit, then, upon demand by such Issuing Bank or such Lender, the Borrower shall pay promptly, and in any event within 3 Business Days of demand, to such Issuing Bank or, in the case of such Lender, to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Issuing Bank or such Lender, such additional amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Issuing Bank or such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amount.
 
(e)                                  Notification and Determination of Additional Costs.  Each of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender, as the case may be, agrees to notify the Borrower (and in the case of an Issuing Bank and or a Lender, to notify the Administrative Agent) of any event occurring after the Agreement Date entitling the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender to compensation under any of the preceding subsections of this Section as promptly as practicable; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender to give such notice shall not release the Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent set forth in subsection (f); provided, further, that the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender, as the case may be, shall not be entitled to submit a claim for compensation based upon a Regulatory Change described in the last sentence of the definition of the term Regulatory Change unless such Person shall have determined that the making of such claim is consistent with its general practices under similar circumstances in respect of similarly situated borrowers with credit agreements entitling it to make such claims (it being agreed that none of the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender shall be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information in connection with such determination or the making of such claim).  The Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender, as the case may be, agrees to furnish to the Borrower (and in the case of the Issuing Bank or a Lender to the Administrative Agent as well) a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request for compensation under this Section.  Determinations by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, of the effect of any Regulatory Change shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay the Administrative Agent, any such Issuing Bank or any such Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
(f)                                   Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or Issuing Banks right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Regulatory Change giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lenders or Issuing Banks intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Regulatory Change giving rise to such increased costs or 
 
55





 
reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
 
Section 4.2.  Suspension of LIBOR Loans.
 
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of LIBOR for any Interest Period:
 
(a)                                 the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for the ascertaining LIBOR for such Interest Period;
 
(b)                                 the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of LIBOR are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of interest for LIBOR Loans as provided herein; or
 
(c)                                  the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that the relevant rates of interest referred to in the definition of LIBOR upon the basis of which the rate of interest for LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period is to be determined are not likely to adequately cover the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period;
 
then the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower and each Lender prompt notice thereof and, so long as such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to, and shall not, make additional LIBOR Loans, Continue LIBOR Loans or Convert Loans into LIBOR Loans, and such Lenders LIBOR Loans shall be treated in accordance with Section 4.5.
 
Section 4.3.  Illegality.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding) that it is unlawful due to a change in (or the interpretation of), or adoption of, any law or regulation from a Governmental Authority becoming effective after the date of this Agreement for such Lender to honor its obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof (with a copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent) and such Lenders obligation to make or Continue, or to Convert Loans of any other Type into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain LIBOR Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 4.5. shall be applicable).
 
Section 4.4.  Compensation.
 
The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such amount or amounts as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion shall be sufficient to compensate such Lender for any loss, cost or expense attributable to:
 
(a)                                 any payment or prepayment (whether mandatory or optional) of a LIBOR Loan, or Conversion of a LIBOR Loan, made by such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, acceleration) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or
 
56





 
(b)                                 any failure by the Borrower for any reason (including, without limitation, the failure of any of the applicable conditions precedent specified in Section 5.2. to be satisfied) to borrow a LIBOR Loan from such Lender on the date for such borrowing, or to Convert a Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan or Continue a LIBOR Loan on the requested date of such Conversion or Continuation.
 
Not in limitation of the foregoing, such compensation shall include, without limitation, in the case of a LIBOR Loan, an amount equal to the then present value of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on such LIBOR Loan for the remainder of the Interest Period at the rate applicable to such LIBOR Loan, less (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on the same LIBOR Loan for the same period if LIBOR were set on the date on which such LIBOR Loan was repaid, prepaid or Converted or the date on which the Borrower failed to borrow, Convert or Continue, as applicable, such LIBOR Loan calculating present value by using as a discount rate LIBOR quoted on such date.  Upon the Borrowers request, the Administrative Agent shall provide the Borrower with a statement setting forth the basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining the amount thereof.  Any such statement shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
Section 4.5.  Treatment of Affected Loans.
 
If the obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Loans or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 4.1.(c), Section 4.2. or Section 4.3. then such Lenders LIBOR Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for LIBOR Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion required by Section 4.1.(c), Section 4.2., or Section 4.3. on such earlier date as such Lender or Administrative Agent, as applicable, may specify to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent, as applicable)) and, unless and until such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 4.1., Section 4.2. or Section 4.3. that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:
 
(a)                                 to the extent that such Lenders LIBOR Loans have been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lenders LIBOR Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and
 
(b)                                 all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender as LIBOR Loans shall be made or Continued instead as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be Converted into LIBOR Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.
 
If such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent, as applicable) that the circumstances specified in Sections 4.1.(c), 4.2. or 4.3. that gave rise to the Conversion of such Lenders LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section no longer exist (which such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when LIBOR Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, then such Lenders Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding LIBOR Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding LIBOR Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, Types and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments.

Section 4.6.  Affected Lenders.
 
If (a) a Lender requests compensation pursuant to Section 3.10. or 4.1., and the Requisite Lenders are not also doing the same, (b) the obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Loans or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 4.1.(b) or 4.3. but the obligation of the Requisite Lenders shall not have been suspended under such Sections, or (c) a Lender becomes a Non-Consenting Lender, then, so long as there does not then exist any Default or Event of Default, the Borrower may demand that such Lender (the Affected Lender), and upon such demand the Affected Lender shall promptly, assign its Commitment to an Eligible Assignee subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.5.(b) for a purchase price equal to (x) the aggregate principal balance of all Loans then owing to the Affected Lender, plus (y) the aggregate amount of payments previously made by the Affected Lender under Section 2.3.(j) that have not been repaid, plus (z) any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and accrued but unpaid fees owing to the Affected Lender, or any other amount as may be mutually agreed upon by such Affected Lender and Eligible Assignee.  Each of the Administrative Agent and the Affected Lender shall reasonably cooperate in effectuating the replacement of such Affected Lender under this Section and the Affected Lender shall promptly execute all documents reasonably requested to surrender and transfer such interest to the purchaser or assignee thereof, including an appropriate Assignment and Assumption, but at no time shall the Administrative Agent, such Affected Lender nor any other Lender nor any Titled Agent be obligated in any way whatsoever to initiate any such replacement or to assist in finding an Eligible Assignee.  The exercise by the Borrower of its rights under this Section shall be at the Borrowers sole cost and expense and at no cost or expense to the Administrative Agent, the Affected Lender or any of the other Lenders.  The terms of this Section shall not in any way limit the Borrowers obligation to pay to any Affected Lender compensation owing to such Affected Lender pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, pursuant to Sections 3.10., 4.1. or 4.4.) with respect to any period up to the date of replacement.
 
Section 4.7.  Change of Lending Office.
 
Each Lender agrees that it will use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate an alternate Lending Office with respect to any of its Loans affected by the matters or circumstances described in Sections 3.10., 4.1. or 4.3. to reduce the liability of the Borrower or avoid the results provided thereunder, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender as determined by such Lender in its sole discretion, except that such Lender shall have no obligation to designate a Lending Office located in the United States of America.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation.
 
Section 4.8.  Assumptions Concerning Funding of LIBOR Loans.
 
Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Article shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded LIBOR Loans through the purchase of deposits in the relevant market bearing interest at the rate applicable to such LIBOR Loans in an amount equal to the amount of the LIBOR Loans and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period; provided, however, that each Lender may fund each of its LIBOR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be used only for calculation of amounts payable under this Article.

The obligations of (i) Lenders to make any Loans and (ii) an Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit (including the Obligations to make any Loans or to issue any Letter of Credit in connection with the first Credit Event) are each subject to the further conditions precedent that: (a) no Default or Event of Default shall exist as of the date of the making of such Loan or date of issuance of such Letter of Credit or would exist immediately after giving effect thereto, and no violation of the limits described in Section 2.15. would occur after giving effect thereto; (b) the representations and warranties made or deemed made by the Borrower and each other Loan Party in the Loan Documents to which any of them is a party, shall be true and correct in all material respects (except in the case of a representation or warranty qualified by materiality, in which case such representation or warranty shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the date of the making of such Loan or date of issuance of such Letter of Credit with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date except to the extent that such representations and warranties expressly relate solely to an earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects (except in the case of a representation or warranty qualified by materiality, in which case such representation or warranty shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of such earlier date) and except for changes in factual circumstances permitted hereunder; and (c) in the case of the borrowing of Revolving Loans, the Administrative Agent shall have received a timely Notice of Revolving Borrowing, in the case of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender shall have received a timely Notice of Swingline Borrowing and in each case of the issuance of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent shall have received a timely request for the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  Each Credit Event shall constitute a certification by the Borrower to the effect set forth in the preceding sentence (both as of the date of the giving of notice relating to such Credit Event and, unless the Borrower otherwise notifies the Administrative Agent prior to the date of such Credit Event, as of the date of the occurrence of such Credit Event).  In addition, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders at the time such Loan is made or such Letter of Credit is issued that all conditions to the making of such Loan or issuing of such Letter of Credit contained in this Article V. have been satisfied.  Unless set forth in writing to the contrary, the making of its initial Loan by a Lender shall constitute a certification by such Lender to the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders that the conditions precedent for the initial Loans set forth in Sections 5.1. and 5.2. that have not previously been waived by the Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement have been satisfied; provided that this sentence shall inure only to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and not to the Borrower or any other Loan Party.
 
ARTICLE VI. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
 
Section 6.1.  Representations and Warranties.
 
In order to induce the Administrative Agent and each Lender to enter into this Agreement and to make Loans and, in the case of an Issuing Bank, to issue Letters of Credit, the Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender as follows:
 
(a)                                 Organization; Power; Qualification.  Each of the Borrower, the other Loan Parties and the other Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or other legal entity, duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing under the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, has the power and authority to own or lease its respective properties and to carry on its respective business as now being and 
 
61





 
hereafter proposed to be conducted and is duly qualified and is in good standing as a foreign corporation, partnership or other legal entity, and authorized to do business, in each jurisdiction in which the character of its properties or the nature of its business requires such qualification or authorization and where the failure to be so qualified or authorized could reasonably be expected to have, in each instance, a Material Adverse Effect.

(b)                                 to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal and interest) payable to the Lenders under the Loan Documents, including attorney fees, ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause (b) payable to them;

(d)                                 to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid interest on the Revolving Loans, Term Loans and Reimbursement Obligations, ratably among the Lenders and the Issuing Banks in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause (d) payable to them;
 
(e)                                  to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid principal of the Swingline Loans;

(g)                                  the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Applicable Law.
 
Section 10.6.  Letter of Credit Collateral Account.
 
(a)                                 As collateral security for the prompt payment in full when due of all Letter of Credit Liabilities and the other Obligations, the Borrower hereby pledges and grants to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Revolving Lenders as provided herein, a security interest in all of its right, title and interest in and to the Letter of Credit 
 
85





 
Collateral Account and the balances from time to time in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account (including the investments and reinvestments therein provided for below).  The balances from time to time in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account shall not constitute payment of any Letter of Credit Liabilities until applied by an Issuing Bank as provided herein.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, funds held in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account shall be subject to withdrawal only as provided in this Section.
 
(b)                                 Amounts on deposit in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account shall be invested and reinvested by the Administrative Agent in such Cash Equivalents as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion.  All such investments and reinvestments shall be held in the name of and be under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Revolving Lenders; provided, that all earnings on such investments will be credited to and retained in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account.  The Administrative Agent shall exercise reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any funds held in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and shall be deemed to have exercised such care if such funds are accorded treatment substantially equivalent to that which the Administrative Agent accords other funds deposited with the Administrative Agent, it being understood that the Administrative Agent shall not have any responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any funds held in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account.
 
(c)                                  If a drawing pursuant to any Letter of Credit occurs on or prior to the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, the Borrower and the Lenders authorize the Administrative Agent to use the monies deposited in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for the payment made by such Issuing Bank to the beneficiary with respect to such drawing or the payee with respect to such presentment.
 
(d)                                 If an Event of Default exists, the Administrative Agent may (and, if instructed by the Requisite Lenders, shall) in its (or their) discretion at any time and from time to time elect to liquidate any such investments and reinvestments and apply the proceeds thereof to the Obligations in accordance with Section 10.5.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to liquidate and release any such amounts if such liquidation or release would result in the amount available in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account being less than the Stated Amount of all Extended Letters of Credit that remain outstanding.
 
(e)                                  So long as no Default or Event of Default exists, and to the extent amounts on deposit in or credited to the Letter of Credit Collateral Account exceed the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit Liabilities then due and owing, the Administrative Agent shall, from time to time, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower within 5 Business Days after the Administrative Agents receipt of such request from the Borrower, against receipt but without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever, such amount of the credit balances in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account as exceeds the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Liabilities at such time.  Upon the expiration, termination or cancellation of an Extended Letter of Credit for which the Lenders reimbursed (or funded participations in) a drawing deemed to have occurred under the fourth sentence of Section 2.3.(b) for deposit into the Letter of Credit Collateral Account but in respect of which the Lenders have not otherwise received payment for the amount so reimbursed or funded, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Lenders the amount so reimbursed or funded for such Extended Letter of Credit that remains in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account, pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid reimbursements or funded participations of the Lenders in respect of such Extended Letter of Credit, against receipt but without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever.  When all of the Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and no Letters of Credit remain outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall 
 
86





 
deliver to the Borrower, against receipt but without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever, the balances remaining in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account.
 
(f)                                   The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent from time to time such fees as the Administrative Agent normally charges for similar services in connection with the Administrative Agents administration of the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and investments and reinvestments of funds therein.
 
Section 10.7.  Performance by Administrative Agent.
 
If the Borrower or any other Loan Party shall fail to perform any covenant, duty or agreement contained in any of the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent may, after notice to the Borrower, perform or attempt to perform such covenant, duty or agreement on behalf of the Borrower or such other Loan Party after the expiration of any cure or grace periods set forth herein.  In such event, the Borrower shall, at the request of the Administrative Agent, promptly pay any amount reasonably expended by the Administrative Agent in such performance or attempted performance to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon at the applicable Post-Default Rate from the date of such expenditure until paid.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever for the performance of any obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
 
Section 10.8.  Rights Cumulative.
 
(a)                                 Generally.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Lenders and the Specified Derivatives Providers under this Agreement, each of the other Loan Documents and Specified Derivatives Contracts shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any of them may otherwise have under Applicable Law.  In exercising their respective rights and remedies the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Lenders and the Specified Derivatives Providers may be selective and no failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any of the Issuing Banks, any of the Lenders or any of the Specified Derivatives Providers in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of it, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude its other or further exercise or the exercise of any other power or right.
 
(b)                                 Enforcement by Administrative Agent.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance with Article X. for the benefit of all the Lenders and all the Issuing Banks; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (ii) any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as the applicable Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be) hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, (iii) any Specified Derivatives Provider from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit under any Specified Derivatives Contract, (iv) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 12.3. (subject to the terms of Section 3.3.), or (v) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Loan Party under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (x) the Requisite Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Article X. and (y) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (ii), (iv) and (v) of the preceding proviso 
 
87





 
and subject to Section 3.3., any Lender may, with the consent of the Requisite Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Requisite Lenders.
 
ARTICLE XI. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
 
Section 11.1.  Appointment and Authorization.
 
Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as contractual representative on such Lenders behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Not in limitation of the foregoing, each Lender authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent to enter into the Loan Documents for the benefit of the Lenders.  Each Lender hereby agrees that, except as otherwise set forth herein, any action taken by the Requisite Lenders in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or the Loan Documents, and the exercise by the Requisite Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of the Lenders.  Nothing herein shall be construed to deem the Administrative Agent a trustee or fiduciary for any Lender or to impose on the Administrative Agent duties or obligations other than those expressly provided for herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the terms Agent, Administrative Agent, agent and similar terms in the Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any Applicable Law.  Instead, use of such terms is merely a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.  The Administrative Agent shall deliver or otherwise make available to each Lender, promptly upon receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent, copies of each of the financial statements, certificates, notices and other documents delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Article VIII. that the Borrower is not otherwise required to deliver directly to the Lenders.  The Administrative Agent will furnish to any Lender, upon the request of such Lender, a copy (or, where appropriate, an original) of any document, instrument, agreement, certificate or notice furnished to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Affiliate of the Borrower, pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document not already delivered or otherwise made available to such Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any such other Loan Document.  As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of any of the Obligations), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Requisite Lenders (or all of the Lenders if explicitly required under any other provision of this Agreement), and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of any of the Obligations; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or Applicable Law.  Not in limitation of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may exercise any right or remedy it or the Lenders may have under any Loan Document upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default unless the Requisite Lenders have directed the Administrative Agent otherwise.  Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of the Requisite Lenders, or where applicable, all the Lenders.

The Lender acting as Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers as a Lender or a Specified Derivatives Provider, as the case may be, under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Specified Derivatives Contract, as the case may be, as any other Lender or Specified Derivatives Provider and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent; and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Wells Fargo in each case in its individual capacity.  Wells Fargo and its Affiliates may each accept deposits from, maintain deposits or credit balances for, invest in, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, serve as financial advisor to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Affiliate thereof as if it were any other bank and without any duty to account therefor to the Issuing Banks, the other Lenders, or any Specified Derivatives Providers.  Further, the Administrative Agent and any Affiliate may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement or any Specified Derivatives Contract, or otherwise without having to account for the same to the Issuing Banks, the other Lenders or any Specified Derivatives Providers.  The Issuing Banks and the Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Wells Fargo or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Borrower, other Loan Parties, other Subsidiaries and other Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Person) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them.
 
Section 11.3.  Approvals of Lenders.
 
All communications from the Administrative Agent to any Lender requesting such Lenders determination, consent or approval (a) shall be given in the form of a written notice to such Lender, (b) shall be accompanied by a description of the matter or issue as to which such determination, consent or approval is requested, or shall advise such Lender where information, if any, regarding such matter or issue may be inspected, or shall otherwise describe the matter or issue to be resolved and (c) shall include, if reasonably requested by such Lender and to the extent not previously provided to such Lender, written materials provided to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower in respect of the matter or issue to be resolved.  Unless a Lender shall give written notice to the Administrative Agent that it specifically objects to the requested determination, consent or approval (together with a written explanation of the reasons behind such objection) within 10 Business Days (or such lesser or greater period as may be specifically required under the express terms of the Loan Documents) of receipt of such communication, such Lender shall be deemed to have conclusively approved such requested determination, consent or approval.  The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any amendment, waiver or consent regarding any of the matters described in Section 12.6.(b).
 
Section 11.4.  Notice of Events of Default.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing with reasonable specificity such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default; provided, the failure to provide such a notice of default to the Administrative Agent shall not result in any liability of such Lender to any other party to this Agreement.  If any Lender (excluding the Lender which is also serving as the Administrative Agent) becomes aware of any Default or Event of Default, it shall promptly send to the Administrative Agent such a notice of default.  Further, if the Administrative Agent receives such a notice of default, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.

Section 11.5.  Administrative Agents Reliance.
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein or therein as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (including its own counsel or counsel for the Borrower or any other Loan Party), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties: (a) makes any warranty or representation to any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any other Person, or shall be responsible to any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any other Person for any statement, warranty or representation made or deemed made by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (b) shall have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the satisfaction of any conditions precedent under this Agreement or any Loan Document on the part of the Borrower or other Persons (other than, in the case of the satisfaction of any conditions precedent, confirmation of receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent), or to inspect the property, books or records of the Borrower or any other Person; (c) shall be responsible to any Lender or any Issuing Bank for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto or any collateral covered thereby or the perfection or priority of any Lien in favor of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Specified Derivatives Providers in any such collateral; (d) shall have any liability in respect of any recitals, statements, certifications, representations or warranties contained in any of the Loan Documents or any other document, instrument, agreement, certificate or statement delivered in connection therewith; and (e) shall incur any liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail) believed by it to be genuine and signed, sent or given by the proper party or parties.  The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under the Loan Documents by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such agent or attorney-in-fact as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment.
 
Section 11.6.  Indemnification of Administrative Agent.
 
Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) pro rata in accordance with such Lenders respective Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent but not as a Lender) in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents, any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents (collectively, Indemnifiable Amounts); provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such Indemnifiable Amounts to the extent resulting from the Administrative Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment; provided, however, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Requisite Lenders (or all of the Lenders, if expressly 
 
90





 
required hereunder) shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) promptly upon demand for its Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of any out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the counsel to the Administrative Agent) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, administration, or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise) of, or legal advice with respect to the rights or responsibilities of the parties under, the Loan Documents, any suit or action brought by the Administrative Agent to enforce the terms of the Loan Documents and/or collect any Obligations, any lender liability suit or claim brought against the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders, and any claim or suit brought against the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders arising under any Environmental Laws.  Such out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) shall be advanced by the Lenders on the request of the Administrative Agent notwithstanding any claim or assertion that the Administrative Agent is not entitled to indemnification hereunder upon receipt of an undertaking by the Administrative Agent that the Administrative Agent will reimburse the Lenders if it is actually and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Administrative Agent is not so entitled to indemnification.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and the termination of this Agreement.  If the Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for any Indemnifiable Amount following payment by any Lender to the Administrative Agent in respect of such Indemnifiable Amount pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall share such reimbursement on a ratable basis with each Lender making any such payment.
 
Section 11.7.  Lender Credit Decision, Etc.
 
Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties has made any representations or warranties to such Issuing Bank or such Lender and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary or Affiliate, shall be deemed to constitute any such representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank or any Lender.  Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks acknowledges that it has made its own credit and legal analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or counsel to the Administrative Agent, or any of their respective Related Parties, and based on the financial statements of the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, the other Subsidiaries and other Affiliates, and inquiries of such Persons, its independent due diligence of the business and affairs of the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, the other Subsidiaries and other Persons, its review of the Loan Documents, the legal opinions required to be delivered to it hereunder, the advice of its own counsel and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate.  Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or counsel to the Administrative Agent or any of their respective Related Parties, and based on such review, advice, documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under the Loan Documents.  The Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Borrower or any other Loan Party of the Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for therein or to inspect the properties or books of, or make any other investigation of, the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary.  Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or furnished to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the Lenders and/or the Issuing Banks, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender or any 
 
91





 
Issuing Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Affiliate thereof which may come into possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties.  Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks acknowledges that the Administrative Agents legal counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is only acting as counsel to the Administrative Agent and is not acting as counsel to any Lender or any Issuing Bank.
 
Section 11.8.  Successor Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent may (a) resign at any time as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower or (b) be removed as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents by all Lenders (other than the Lender then acting as Administrative Agent) and the Borrower upon 30 days prior written notice if the Administrative Agent is found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment to have committed gross negligence or willful misconduct in the course of performing its duties hereunder.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Requisite Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which appointment shall, provided no Default or Event of Default exists, be subject to the Borrowers approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (except that the Borrower shall, in all events, be deemed to have approved each Lender and any of its Affiliates as a successor Administrative Agent).  If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the current Administrative Agents giving of notice of resignation or giving of notice of removal of the Administrative Agent, then the current Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a Lender, if any Lender shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be an Eligible Assignee; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no Lender has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made to each Lender and each Issuing Bank directly, until such time as a successor Administrative Agent has been appointed as provided for above in this Section; provided, further that such Lenders and such Issuing Bank so acting directly shall be and be deemed to be protected by all indemnities and other provisions herein for the benefit and protection of the Administrative Agent as if each such Lender or such Issuing Bank were itself the Administrative Agent.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the current Administrative Agent, and the current Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents.  Any resignation by, or removal of, an Administrative Agent shall also constitute the resignation or removal as an Issuing Bank and as the Swingline Lender by the Lender then acting as Administrative Agent (the Resigning Lender).  Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder (i) the Resigning Lender shall be discharged from all duties and obligations of an Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (ii) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for all Letters of Credit issued by the Resigning Lender as an Issuing Bank outstanding at the time of such succession (which letters of credit issued in substitutions shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit issued hereunder) or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Resigning Lender to effectively assume the obligations of the Resigning Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit.  After any Administrative Agents resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article XI. shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent may
 
92





 
assign its rights and duties under the Loan Documents to any of its Affiliates by giving the Borrower and each Lender prior written notice.
 
Section 11.9.  Titled Agents.
 
Each of the Lead Arrangers and the Syndication Agents (each a Titled Agent) in each such respective capacity, assumes no responsibility or obligation hereunder, including, without limitation, for servicing, enforcement or collection of any of the Loans, nor any duties as an agent hereunder for the Lenders.  The titles given to the Titled Agents are solely honorific and imply no fiduciary responsibility on the part of the Titled Agents to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Bank, the Borrower or any other Loan Party and the use of such titles does not impose on the Titled Agents any duties or obligations greater than those of any other Lender or entitle the Titled Agents to any rights other than those to which any other Lender is entitled.

(a)                                 EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY BETWEEN OR AMONG THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY OF THE ISSUING BANKS OR ANY OF THE LENDERS WOULD BE BASED ON DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX ISSUES OF LAW AND FACT AND WOULD RESULT IN DELAY AND EXPENSE TO THE PARTIES.  ACCORDINGLY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF THE LENDERS, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, EACH OF THE ISSUING BANKS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR NATURE IN ANY COURT OR TRIBUNAL IN WHICH AN ACTION MAY BE COMMENCED BY OR AGAINST ANY PARTY HERETO ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR BY REASON OF ANY OTHER SUIT, CAUSE OF ACTION OR DISPUTE WHATSOEVER BETWEEN OR AMO

ORTH IN THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO PRECLUDE THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY ISSUING BANK OR ANY LENDER OR THE ENFORCEMENT BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY ISSUING BANK OR ANY LENDER OF ANY JUDGMENT OBTAINED IN SUCH FORUM IN ANY OTHER APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION.
 
(c)                                  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY EACH PARTY WITH THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND WITH A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES THEREOF, AND SHALL SURVIVE THE PAYMENT OF THE LOANS AND ALL OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE HEREUNDER OR UNDER THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, THE TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF ALL LETTERS OF CREDIT AND THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 
Section 12.5.  Successors and Assigns.
 
(a)                                 Successors and Assigns Generally.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of the immediately following subsection (b), (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of the immediately following subsection (d) or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of the immediately following subsection (f) (and subject to the last sentence of the immediately following subsection (b) with respect to any Lender, any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in the immediately following subsection (d) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
(b)                                 Assignments by Lenders.  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of 
 
97





 
its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
 
(i)                                     Minimum Amounts.
 
(A)                               in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of an assigning Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment and/or the Loans at the time owing to it, or contemporaneous assignments to related Approved Funds that equal at least the amount specified in the immediately following clause (B) in the aggregate, or in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of an assigning Term Loan Lenders Term Loans at the time owing to it, or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and
 
(B)                               in any case not described in the immediately preceding subsection (A), the aggregate amount of a specific Class of Commitments (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Class of Commitments is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the applicable Class of Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (in each case, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000 in the case of any assignment of a Commitment or a Loan, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall exist, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that if after giving effect to such assignment, the amount of the Commitments held by such assigning Lender or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the outstanding principal balance of the Loans of such assigning Lender, as applicable, would be less than $5,000,000 in the case of a Commitment or Loan, then such assigning Lender shall assign the entire amount of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it.

(iv)                              Assignment and Assumption; Notes.  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $4,500 for each assignment, and the assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.  If requested by the transferor Lender or the assignee, upon the consummation of any assignment, the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes are issued to the assignee and such transferor Lender, as appropriate.
 
(v)                                 No Assignment to Certain Persons.  No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or to any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B).
 
(vi)                              No Assignment to Natural Persons.  No such assignment shall be made to a natural person.
 
(vii)                           Certain Additional Payments.  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Revolving Commitment Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under Applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the immediately following subsection (c), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.10.,
 
99





 
4.1., 4.4., 12.2. and 12.9. and the other provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as provided in Section 12.10. with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender having been a Defaulting Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with the immediately following subsection (d).
 
(c)                                  Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Principal Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(d)                                 Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of any of its Commitments and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to (w) increase such Lenders Commitment, (x) extend the date fixed for the payment of principal on the Loans or portions thereof owing to such Lender, (y) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon or (z) release any Guarantor from its Obligations under the Guaranty except as contemplated by Section 7.13.(b), in each case, as applicable to that portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations that are subject to the participation.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.10., 4.1., 4.4. (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.10.(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.10.(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 4.6. as if it were an assignee under subsection (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 4.1. or 3.10., with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Regulatory Change that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 4.6. with respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.3. as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.3. as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each 
 
100





 
Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
(e)                                  Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(f)                                   No Registration.  Each Lender agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, it will not make any assignment hereunder in any manner or under any circumstances that would require registration or qualification of, or filings in respect of, any Loan or Note under the Securities Act or any other securities laws of the United States of America or of any other jurisdiction.
 
(g)                                  Patriot Act Notice; Compliance.  In order for the Administrative Agent to comply with know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation, the Patriot Act, prior to any Lender that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States of America becoming a party hereto, the Administrative Agent may request, and such Lender shall provide to the Administrative Agent, its name, address, tax identification number and/or such other identification information as shall be necessary for the Administrative Agent to comply with federal law.
 
Section 12.6.  Amendments and Waivers.
 
(a)                                 Generally.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, (i) any consent or approval required or permitted by this Agreement or any other Loan Document to be given by the Lenders may be given, (ii) any term of this Agreement or of any other Loan Document may be amended, (iii) the performance or observance by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary of any terms of this Agreement or such other Loan Document may be waived, and (iv) the continuance of any Default or Event of Default may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with, but only with, the written consent of the Requisite Lenders (or the Administrative Agent at the written direction of the Requisite Lenders), and, in the case of an amendment to any Loan Document, the written consent of each Loan Party which is party thereto.  Subject to the immediately following subsection (b), any term of this Agreement or of any other Loan Document relating solely to the rights or obligations of the Lenders of a particular Class, and not Lenders of any other Class, may be amended, and the performance or observance by the Borrower or any other Loan Party or any Subsidiary of any such terms may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with, and only with, the written consent of the Requisite Class Lenders for such Class of Lenders (and, in the case of an amendment to any Loan Document, the written consent of each Loan Party which is a party thereto).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained 
 
101





 
in this Section, the Fee Letter may only be amended, and the performance or observance by any Loan Party thereunder may only be waived, in a writing executed by the parties thereto.
 
(b)                                 Additional Lender Consents.  In addition to the foregoing requirements, no amendment, waiver, forbearance, or consent shall do any of the following:
 
(i)                                     increase (or reinstate) the Commitments of a Lender (excluding any increase as a result of an assignment of Commitments permitted under Section 12.5. and any increases contemplated under Section 2.16.) or subject a Lender to any additional obligations without the written consent of such Lender;
 
(ii)                                  reduce the principal of, or interest that has accrued or the rates of interest that will be charged on the outstanding principal amount of, any Loans or other Obligations without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; provided, however, only the written consent of the Requisite Lenders shall be required for the waiver of interest payable at the Post-Default Rate, retraction of the imposition of interest at the Post-Default Rate and amendment of the definition of Post-Default Rate;
 
(iii)                               reduce the amount of any Fees payable to a Lender without the written consent of such Lender;

(v)                                 modify clause (b) of the definition of Termination Date or otherwise postpone any date fixed for, or forgive, any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Term Loans or for the payment of Fees or any other Obligations owing to the Term Loan Lenders, in each case, without the written consent of each Term Loan Lender directly affected thereby;
 
(vi)                              while any Term Loans remain outstanding, amend, modify or waive (A) Section 5.2. or any other provision of this Agreement if the effect of such amendment, modification or waiver is to (1) require the Revolving Lenders to make Revolving Loans, (2) require an Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit or (3) require the Swingline Bank to make Swingline Loans, in each case, when such Lenders or such Issuing Bank would not otherwise be required to do so, (B) the amount of the Swingline Commitment or (C) the L/C Commitment Amount, in each case, without the prior written consent of the Requisite Class Lenders of the Revolving Lenders;

(x)                                 modify the definition of the term Requisite Lenders or (except as otherwise provided in the immediately following clause (xi)), modify in any other manner the number or percentage of the Lenders required to make any determinations or waive any rights hereunder or to modify any provision hereof without the written consent of each Lender;
 
(xi)                              modify the definition of the term Requisite Class Lenders as it relates to a particular Class of Lenders or modify in any other manner the number or percentage of a Class of Lenders required to make any determinations or waive any rights hereunder or to modify any provision hereof, in each case, solely with respect to such Class of Lenders, without the written consent of each Lender of such Class;
 
(xii)                           release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty except as contemplated by Section 7.13.(b) without the written consent of each Lender; or
 
(xiii)                        amend, or waive the Borrowers compliance with, Section 2.15. without the written consent of each Lender.
 
(c)                                  Amendment of Administrative Agents Duties, Etc.  No amendment, waiver or consent unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action, shall affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.  Any amendment, waiver or consent relating to Section 2.4. or the obligations of the Swingline Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action, require the written consent of the Swingline Lender.  Any amendment, waiver or consent relating to Section 2.3. or the obligations of the Issuing Banks under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action, require the written consent of each Issuing Bank.  Any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to any Loan Document that (i) diminishes the rights of a Specified Derivatives Provider in a manner or to an extent dissimilar to that affecting the Lenders or (ii) increases the liabilities or obligations of a Specified Derivatives Provider shall, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action, require the consent of the Lender that is (or having an Affiliate that is) such Specified Derivatives Provider.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (x) the Commitments of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased, reinstated or extended without the written consent of such Defaulting Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the written consent of such Defaulting Lender.  No waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or impair any right consequent thereon and any amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose set forth therein.  No course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial thereto.  Any Event of Default occurring hereunder shall continue to exist until such time as such Event of Default is waived in writing in accordance with the terms of this Section, notwithstanding 
 
103





 
any attempted cure or other action by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person subsequent to the occurrence of such Event of Default.  Except as otherwise explicitly provided for herein or in any other Loan Document, no notice to or demand upon the Borrower shall entitle the Borrower to other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
 
(d)                                 Technical Amendments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12.6., if the Administrative Agent and the Borrower have jointly identified an ambiguity, omission, mistake or defect in any provision of this Agreement or an inconsistency between provisions of this Agreement, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend such provision or provisions to cure such ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency so long as to do so would not adversely affect the interests of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks.  Any such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any of other party to this Agreement.
 
Section 12.7.  Nonliability of Administrative Agent and Lenders.
 
The relationship between the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent, on the other hand, shall be solely that of borrower and lender.  None of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower and no provision in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents, and no course of dealing between or among any of the parties hereto, shall be deemed to create any fiduciary duty owing by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender to any Lender, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party.  None of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrowers business or operations.
 
Section 12.8.  Confidentiality.
 
Except as otherwise provided by Applicable Law, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender shall maintain the confidentiality of all Information (as defined below) but in any event may make disclosure: (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates other respective Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential); (b) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any actual or proposed assignee, Participant or other transferee in connection with a potential transfer of any Commitment or participation therein as permitted hereunder, or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations; (c) as required or requested by any Governmental Authority or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process or in connection with any legal proceedings, or as otherwise required by Applicable Law; (d) to the Administrative Agents, such Issuing Banks or such Lenders independent auditors and other professional advisors (provided they shall be notified of the confidential nature of the information); (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies under any Loan Document (or any Specified Derivatives Contract) or any action or proceeding relating to any Loan Document (or any such Specified Derivatives Contract) or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder; (f) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section actually known by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender to be a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Lender or any Affiliate of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower; (g) to the extent requested by, or required to be disclosed to, any nationally recognized rating agency or regulatory or similar authority (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners) having or purporting to have jurisdiction over it; (h) to bank trade publications, such information to consist of deal 
 
104





 
terms and other information customarily found in such publications; (i) to any other party hereto; and (j) with the consent of the Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender may disclose any such confidential information, without notice to the Borrower or any other Loan Party, to Governmental Authorities in connection with any regulatory examination of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender or in accordance with the regulatory compliance policy of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender.  In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Commitments.  As used in this Section, the term Information means all information received from the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any other Subsidiary or Affiliate relating to any Loan Party or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any other Subsidiary or any Affiliate, provided that, in the case of any such information received from the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any other Subsidiary or any Affiliate after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
 
Section 12.9.  Indemnification.
 
(a)                                 The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Issuing Bank, each Lender and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnified Party) against, and hold each Indemnified Party harmless from, and shall pay or reimburse any such Indemnified Party for, any and all losses, claims (including without limitation, Environmental Claims), damages, liabilities and related expenses (including without limitation, the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnified Party (which counsel may be employees of any Indemnified Party)), incurred by any Indemnified Party or asserted against any Indemnified Party by any Person (including the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary) other than such Indemnified Party and its Related Parties, arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto or thereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by an Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by it if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary, or any Environmental Claim related in any way to the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary, (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding (an Indemnity Proceeding) relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary, and regardless of whether any Indemnified Party is a party thereto, or (v) any claim (including without limitation, any Environmental Claims), investigation, litigation or other proceeding (whether or not the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender is a party thereto) and the prosecution and defense thereof, arising out of or in any way connected with the Loans, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys and consultants fees; provided, however, that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnified Party, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or 
 
105





 
related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party.
 
(b)                                 If and to the extent that the obligations of the Borrower under this Section are unenforceable for any reason, the Borrower hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such obligations which is permissible under Applicable Law.

Section 12.11.  Severability of Provisions.
 
If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severed from the Loan Documents, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall remain in full force as though the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision had never been part of the Loan Documents.

Administrative Agent or any other Guarantied Party in the enforcement of any of the foregoing or any obligation of such Guarantor hereunder; and (d) all other Obligations.
 
Section 2.  Guaranty of Payment and Not of Collection.  This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment, and not of collection, and a debt of each Guarantor for its own account.  Accordingly, the Guarantied Parties shall not be obligated or required before enforcing this Guaranty against any Guarantor: (a) to pursue any right or remedy the Guarantied Parties may have against the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person or commence any suit or other proceeding against the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person in any court or other tribunal; (b) to make any claim in a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person; or (c) to make demand of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person or to enforce or seek to enforce or realize upon any collateral security held by the Guarantied Parties which may secure any of the Guarantied Obligations.
 
Section 3.  Guaranty Absolute.  Each Guarantor guarantees that the Guarantied Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the documents evidencing the same, regardless of any Applicable Law now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Guarantied Parties with respect thereto.  The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be absolute, irrevocable and unconditional in accordance with its terms and shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, suspended, discharged, terminated or otherwise affected by, any circumstance or occurrence whatsoever, including without limitation, the following (whether or not such Guarantor consents thereto or has notice thereof):
 
(a)       

ied Obligations or any other instrument or agreement referred to therein or evidencing any Guarantied Obligations or any assignment or transfer of any of the foregoing;
 
(b)           any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any other document, instrument or agreement referred to therein or evidencing any Guarantied Obligations or any assignment or transfer of any of the foregoing;

(d)           any settlement or compromise of any of the Guarantied Obligations, any security therefor, or any liability of any other party with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations, or any subordination of the payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations to the payment of any other liability of the Borrower or any other Loan Party;
 
(e)           any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, composition, adjustment, dissolution, liquidation or other like proceeding relating to such Guarantor, any other Loan Party or any other Person, or any action taken with respect to this Guaranty by any trustee or receiver, or by any court, in any such proceeding;
 
B-2





 
(f)            any act or failure to act by any Loan Party or any other Person which may adversely affect such Guarantors subrogation rights, if any, against any other Loan Party or any other Person to recover payments made under this Guaranty;
 
(g)           any nonperfection or impairment of any security interest or other Lien on any collateral, if any, securing in any way any of the Guarantied Obligations;
 
(h)           any application of sums paid by any Loan Party or any other Person with respect to the liabilities of any Loan Party to any of the Guarantied Parties, regardless of what liabilities of the Borrower remain unpaid;
 
(i)            any defect, limitation or insufficiency in the borrowing powers of the Borrower or in the exercise thereof;
 
(j)            any defense, set off, claim or counterclaim (other than indefeasible payment and performance in full) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by any Loan Party or any other Person against any Guarantied Party;
 
(k)           any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any Loan Party;
 
(l)            any statement, representation or warranty made or deemed made by or on behalf of any Loan Party under any Loan Document, or any amendment hereto or thereto, proves to have been incorrect or misleading in any respect; or
 
(m)          any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, a Guarantor hereunder (other than indefeasible payment and performance in full).
 
Section 4.  Action with Respect to Guarantied Obligations.  The Guaranteed Parties may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Guarantor, and without discharging 

scribed in Section 3. and may otherwise: (a) amend, modify, alter or supplement the terms of any of the Guarantied Obligations, including, but not limited to, extending or shortening the time of payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations or changing the interest rate that may accrue on any of the Guarantied Obligations; (b) amend, modify, alter or supplement the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document; (c) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with all, or any part, of any collateral securing any of the Guarantied Obligations; (d) release any Loan Party or other Person liable in any manner for the payment or collection of any of the Guarantied Obligations; (e) exercise, or refrain from exercising, any rights against any Loan Party or any other Person; and (f) apply any sum, by whomsoever paid or however realized, to the Guarantied Obligations in such order as the Guarantied Parties shall elect.
 
Section 5.  Representations and Warranties.  Each Guarantor hereby makes to the Administrative Agent and the other Guarantied Parties all of the representations and warranties made by the Borrower with respect to or in any way relating to such Guarantor in the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as if the same were set forth herein in full.
 
Section 6.  Covenants.  Each Guarantor will comply with all covenants with which the Borrower is to cause such Guarantor to comply under the terms of the Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.
 
Section 7.  Waiver.  Each Guarantor, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, hereby waives notice of acceptance hereof or any presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, and any 
 
B-3





 
other act or thing, or omission or delay to do any other act or thing, which in any manner or to any extent might vary the risk of such Guarantor or which otherwise might operate to discharge such Guarantor from its obligations hereunder.
 
Section 8.  Inability to Accelerate.  If the Guarantied Parties or any of them are prevented under Applicable Law or otherwise from demanding or accelerating payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations by reason of any automatic stay or otherwise, the Administrative Agent and/or the other Guarantied Parties shall be entitled to receive from each Guarantor, upon demand therefor, the sums which otherwise would have been due had such demand or acceleration occurred.
 
Section 9.  Reinstatement of Guarantied Obligations.  If claim is ever made on the Administrative Agent or any other Guarantied Party for repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts received in payment or on account of any of the Guarantied Obligations, and the Administrative Agent or such other Guarantied Party repays all or part of said amount by reason of (a) any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction, or (b) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by the Administrative Agent or such other Guarantied Party with any such claimant (including the Borrower or a trustee in bankruptcy for the Borrower), then and in such event each Guarantor agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or compromise shall be binding on it, notwithstanding any revocation hereof or the cancellation of any of the Loan Documents and such Guarantor shall be and remain liable to the Administrative Agent or such other Guarantied Party for the amounts so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount had never originally been paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Guarantied Party.
 
Section 10.  Subrogation.  Upon the making by any Guarantor of any payment hereunder for the account of another Loan Party, such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the payee against such Loan Party; provided, however, that such Guarantor shall not enforce any right or receive any payment by way of subrogation or otherwise take any action in respect of any other claim or cause of action such Guarantor may have against such Loan Party arising by reason of any payment or performance by such Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty, unless and until all of the Guarantied Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full.  If any amount shall be paid to such Guarantor on account of or in respect of such subrogation rights or other claims or causes of action, such Guarantor shall hold such amount in trust for the benefit of the Guarantied Parties and shall forthwith pay such amount to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied against the Guarantied Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement or to be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral security for any Guarantied Obligations existing.
 
Section 11. Payments Free and Clear.  All sums payable by each Guarantor hereunder, whether of principal, interest, fees, expenses, premiums or otherwise, shall be paid in full, without set-off or counterclaim or any deduction or withholding whatsoever (including any Taxes), and if such Guarantor is required by Applicable Law or by any Governmental Authority to make any such deduction or withholding such Guarantor shall pay to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders such additional amount as will result in the receipt by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of the full amount payable hereunder had such deduction or withholding not occurred or been required.
 
Section 12.  Set-off.  In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under any of the other Loan Documents or Applicable Law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, each Guarantor hereby authorizes each Guarantied Party, each Affiliate of a Guarantied Party, and each Participant, at any time while an Event of Default exists, without any prior notice to such Guarantor or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, but in the case of a Guarantied Party (other than the Administrative Agent), an Affiliate of a Guarantied Party (other than the Administrative Agent), or a Participant, subject to receipt of the prior written consent of the Requisite Lenders exercised in their sole 
 
B-4





 
discretion, to set-off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including, but not limited to, indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by a Guarantied Party, an Affiliate of a Guarantied Party or such Participant to or for the credit or the account of such Guarantor against and on account of any of the Guarantied Obligations, although such obligations shall be contingent or unmatured.  Each Guarantor agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, that any Participant may exercise rights of setoff or counterclaim and other rights with respect to its participation as fully as if such Participant were a direct creditor of such Guarantor in the amount of such participation.
 
Section 13.  Subordination.  Each Guarantor hereby expressly covenants and agrees for the benefit of the Guarantied Parties that all obligati

ding, whether by virtue of Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise.  The Applicable Laws under which the possible avoidance or unenforceability of the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder (or any other obligations of such Guarantor to the Guarantied Parties) shall be determined in any such Proceeding are referred to as the Avoidance Provisions.  Accordingly, to the extent that the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder would otherwise be subject to avoidance under the Avoidance Provisions, the maximum Guarantied Obligations for which such Guarantor shall be liable hereunder shall be reduced to that amount which, as of the time any of the Guarantied Obligations are deemed to have been incurred under the Avoidance Provisions, would not cause the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder (or any other obligations of such Guarantor to the Guarantied Parties), to be subject to avoidance under the Avoidance Provisions.  This Section is intended solely to preserve the rights of the Administrative Agent and the other Guarantied Parties hereunder to the maximum extent that would not cause the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder to be subject to avoidance under the Avoidance Provisions, and no Guarantor or any other Person shall have any right or claim under this Section as against the Guarantied Parties that would not otherwise be available to such Person under the Avoidance Provisions.
 
Section 15.  Information.  Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the financial condition of the Loan Parties, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of any of the Guarantied Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither of the Administrative Agent nor any other Guarantied Party shall have any duty whatsoever to advise any Guarantor of information regarding such circumstances or risks.
 
Section 16.  Governing Law.  THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS EXECUTED, AND TO BE FULLY PERFORMED, IN SUCH STATE.
 
B-5





 
SECTION 17.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.
 
(a)           EACH GUARANTOR, AND EACH OF THE GUARANTIED PARTIES BY ACCEPTING THE BENEFITS HEREOF, ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY BETWEEN OR AMONG SUCH GUARANTOR AND ANY OF THE GUARANTIED PARTIES WOULD BE BASED ON DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX ISSUES OF LAW AND FACT AND WOULD RESULT IN DELAY AND EXPENSE TO THE PARTIES.  ACCORDINGLY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF THE GUARANTORS, AND THE GUARANTIED PARTIES BY ACCEPTING THE BENEFITS HEREOF, HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR NATURE IN ANY COURT OR TRIBUNA

ROPERTIES IN THE COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION.  EACH PARTY FURTHER WAIVES ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING WAS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM, AND EACH AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM THE SAME.  THE CHOICE OF FORUM SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO PRECLUDE THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION BY ANY GUARANTIED PARTY OR THE ENFORCEMENT BY ANY GUARANTIED PARTY OF ANY JUDGMENT OBTAINED IN SUCH FORUM IN ANY OTHER APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION.
 
(c)           THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY EACH PARTY WITH THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND WITH A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES THEREOF, AND SHALL SURVIVE THE PAYMENT OF THE LOANS AND ALL OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE HEREUNDER OR UNDER THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, THE TERMINATION, CANCELLATION OR EXPIRATION OF ALL LETTERS OF CREDIT AND THE TERMINATION OF THIS GUARANTY.
 
B-6





 
Section 18.  Loan Accounts.  The Administrative Agent and each other Guarantied Party may maintain books and accounts setting forth the amounts of principal, interest and other sums paid and payable with respect to the Guarantied Obligations arising under or in connection with the Loan Documents, and in the case of any dispute relating to any of the outstanding amount, payment or receipt of any of such Guarantied Obligations or otherwise, the entries in such books and accounts shall be binding on the Guarantors absent manifest error.  The failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Guarantied Party to maintain such books and accounts shall not in any way relieve or discharge any Guarantor of any of its obligations hereunder.
 
Section 19.  Waiver of Remedies.  No delay or failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any other Guarantied Party in the exercise of any right or remedy it may have against any Guarantor hereunder or otherwise shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by the Administrative Agent or any other Guarantied Party of any such right or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right or remedy.
 
Section 20.  Termination.  This Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect with respect to each Guarantor until indefeasible payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations and the termination or cancellation of all Loan Documents in accordance with their respective terms.

Section 22.  JOINT AND SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS.  THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE GUARANTORS HEREUNDER SHALL BE JOINT AND SEVERAL, AND ACCORDINGLY, EACH GUARANTOR CONFIRMS THAT IT IS LIABLE FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTIED OBLIGATIONS AND ALL OF THE OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF EACH OF THE OTHER GUARANTORS HEREUNDER.
 
Section 23.  Amendments.  This Guaranty may not be amended except in writing signed by the Administrative Agent and each Guarantor, subject to Section 12.6. of the Credit Agreement.
 
Section 24.  Payments.  All payments to be made by any Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty shall be made in Dollars, in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at its Principal Office, not later than 12:00 p.m. Eastern time, on the date one Business Day after demand therefor.
 
Section 25.  Notices.  All notices, requests and other communications hereunder shall be in writing (including facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given (a) to each Guarantor at its address set forth below its signature hereto, (b) to the Administrative Agent or any other Guarantied Party at its address for notices provided for in the Loan Documents, as applicable, or (c) as to each such party at 
 
B-7

Section 26.  Severability.  In case any provision of this Guaranty shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

IN THE CASE OF ANY GUARANTOR THAT IS A TRUST, NO TRUSTEE, OFFICER, SHAREHOLDER, EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF SUCH GUARANTOR SHALL BE HELD TO ANY PERSONAL LIABILITY, JOINTLY OR SEVERALLY, FOR ANY OBLIGATION OF, OR CLAIM AGAINST, SUCH GUARANTOR.  ALL PERSONS DEALING WITH SUCH GUARANTOR, IN ANY WAY, SHALL LOOK ONLY TO THE ASSETS OF SUCH GUARANTOR FOR THE PAYMENT OF ANY SUM OR THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OBLIGATION OWING BY SUCH GUARANTOR HEREUNDER. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL NOT LIMIT ANY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY LOAN PARTY.
 
Section 29.  Limitation of Liability.  None of the Administrative Agent, any other Guarantied Party or any of their respective Related Parties shall have any liability with respect to, and each Guarantor hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to sue any of them upon, any claim for any special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages suffered or incurred by a Guarantor in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, this Guaranty, any of the other Loan Documents, or any of the transactions contemplated by this Guaranty or any of the other Loan Documents.  Each Guarantor hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to sue the Administrative Agent, any other Guarantied Party or any of their respective Related Parties for punitive damages in respect of any claim in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, this Guaranty, any of the other Loan Documents, or any of the transactions contemplated by thereby.
 
Section 30. Electronic Delivery of Certain Information.  Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that information regarding the Guarantor may be delivered electronically pursuant to Section 8.5. of the Credit Agreement.
