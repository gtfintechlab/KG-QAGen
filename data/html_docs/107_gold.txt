Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense (excluding any loss, cost or expense arising from Taxes) incurred by it as a result of: (a)any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Advance other than an ABR Advance on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);(b)any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make an Advance) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Advance other than an ABR Advance on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or(c)any assignment of a LIBOR Advance on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor pursuant to Section 3.05 or as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.03;including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Advance or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall not be obligated to compensate any Lender under this Section for any loss of anticipated profits in respect of any of the foregoing.

A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of this Section (“Additional Compensation”), including a description of the event by reason of which it believes it is entitled to such compensation, and supplying reasonable supporting evidence and reasonable detail of the basis of calculation of the amount or amounts, and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  In the event the Lender subsequently recovers all or part of the Additional Compensation paid by the Borrower, it shall promptly repay an equal amount to the Borrower. The obligation to pay such Additional Compensation for subsequent periods will continue until the earlier of termination of the Accommodation or the Commitment affected by the Change in Law, change in capital or liquidity requirement or the lapse or cessation of the Change in Law giving rise to the initial Additional Compensation. A Lender shall make reasonable efforts to limit the incidence of any such Additional Compensation and seek recovery for the account of the Borrower upon the Borrower’s reasonable request at Borrower’s expense, provided such Lender in its reasonable determination suffers no appreciable economic, legal, regulatory or other disadvantage. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, a Lender shall only be entitled to rely upon the provisions of this Section 8.01 if and for so long as it is generally making corresponding demands for similar amounts for similarly situated borrowers pursuant to provisions similar to the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.01 in other loan documents to which such Lender is party.(5)Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, except that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefore, unless the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, in which case - 93 -the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.All of the Borrower’s obligations under this Section 8.01 shall survive the payment in full of the other obligations hereunder and the termination of this Agreement.Section 8.02Taxes(1)Payments Subject to Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any Credit Document shall be made free and clear and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that, if any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent or any Lender is required by Law to deduct or pay any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes in respect of any payment by or on account of any obligation of a Loan Party hereunder or under any other Credit Document, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased by that Loan Party when payable as necessary so that after making or allowing for all required deductions and payments (including deductions and payments applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or payments been required, (ii) the Loan Party shall make any such deductions required to be made by it under Law and (iii) the Loan Party shall timely pay the full amount required to be deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Law.(2)Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (1) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Law.(3)Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 15 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in respect of any payment by or on account of any obligation of a Loan Party hereunder or under any other Credit Document and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. In the event the Lender subsequently recovers by obtaining a refund, credit or otherwise, all or part of the payment made under this Section paid by the Borrower, it shall promptly repay an equal amount to the Borrower. A Lender shall make reasonable efforts to limit the incidence of any payments under this Section and seek recovery for the account of the Borrower upon the Borrower’s reasonable request at the Borrower’s expense, provided such Lender in its reasonable determination suffers no appreciable economic, legal, regulatory - 94 -or other disadvantage and further provided that nothing in this Section shall require a Lender to disclose any Tax returns of such Lender or any other Tax information which such Lender deems to be confidential.(4)Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, the Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.(5)Status of Lenders.  Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for Tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by Law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to withholding or information reporting requirements.Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a)any Lender that is a “United States Person” as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;(b)any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so, whichever of the following is applicable:(i)    executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form) claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party;(ii)    executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any successor form), or- 95 -(iii)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;(iv)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service; and(v)    executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.(6)If a payment made by the Borrower hereunder or under any other Credit Document would be subject to United States federal withholding tax imposed pursuant to FATCA if any Lender fails to comply with applicable reporting and other requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable Law or as reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including documentation prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(c)(i) of the Code or such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent for the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA), to determine the amount to withhold or deduct from such payment and to determine that such Lender has complied with such applicable reporting and other requirements of FATCA. All of the Borrower’s obligations under this Section 8.02 shall survive the payment in full of the other obligations hereunder and the termination of this Agreement.Section 8.03Mitigation Obligations: Replacement of Lenders(1)Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 8.01, or requires the Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 8.02, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Accommodations hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender (with - 96 -the prior consent of the Borrower), such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.01 or 8.02, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.(2)Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 8.01, if the Borrower is required to pay any material additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 8.02, if any Lender’s obligations are suspended pursuant to Section 8.04, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Accommodations hereunder, then the Borrower may either, at its sole expense and effort, upon 10 days’ notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent (%5) repay all outstanding amounts due to such affected  Lender (or such portion which has not been acquired pursuant to clause (ii) below) and thereupon such Commitment of the affected Lender shall be permanently cancelled and the aggregate Commitment shall be permanently reduced by the same amount and the Commitment of each of the other Lenders shall remain the same; or (%5) require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 15.01), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Credit Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:(a)the Borrower pays the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 15.01(2)(d);(b)the assigning Lender receives payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Accommodations Outstanding, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Credit Documents (including any breakage costs and amounts required to be paid under this Agreement as a result of prepayment to a Lender) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);(c)in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 8.01 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 8.02, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and(d)such assignment does not conflict with Law.A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.- 97 -Section 8.04Illegality; Inability to Determine Rates(1)If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make or maintain any Accommodations, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon any particular rate (other than any applicable default rate to the extent the same is not chargeable under Law) or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits as U.S. Dollars in the London interbank market (other than any applicable default rate to the extent the same is not chargeable under Law), then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender with respect to the activity that is unlawful shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if conversion would avoid the activity that is unlawful, convert any Accommodations, or take any necessary steps in order to avoid the activity that is unlawful. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. If any Lender determines, acting reasonably, that any applicable Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender to hold or benefit from an Encumbrance over real property pursuant to any Law of the United States or any state thereof, such Lender may notify the Administrative Agent and disclaim any benefit of such security interest to the extent of such illegality; provided, that such determination or disclaimer shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such Encumbrance for the benefit of any other Lender.(2)If the Majority Lenders or Administrative Agent determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a LIBOR Advance or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) U.S. Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such LIBOR Advance, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Advance, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Advance does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.  Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Majority Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of LIBOR Advances or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of ABR Advances in the amount specified therein.- 98 -ARTICLE 9 RIGHT OF SETOFFSection 9.01Right of Setoff.If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each of the Lenders and each of their respective Affiliates hereby authorized at any time and from time to time to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Loan Party against any and all of the Obligations of the Borrower, any Domestic Guarantor or any Foreign Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Credit Document to such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender has made any demand under this Agreement or any other Credit Document and although such Obligations of the Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.  The rights of each Lender and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff, consolidation of accounts and bankers’ lien) that such Lender or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application, but the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. If any Affiliate of a Lender exercises any rights under this Section 9.01, it shall share the benefit received in accordance with Section 10.01 as if the benefit had been received by the Lender of which it is an Affiliate.ARTICLE 10 SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERSSection 10.01Sharing of Payments by Lenders(1)If any Lender, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtains any payment or other reduction that might result in such Lender receiving payment or other reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Accommodations and accrued interest thereon or other obligations hereunder greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such payment or other reduction shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Accommodations Outstanding and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Accommodations Outstanding and other amounts owing them, provided that:- 99 -(a)if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; (b)the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by any Loan Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Accommodations to any assignee or participant, other than to any Loan Party or any Affiliate of a Loan Party (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply); and(c)the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (w) any payment made while no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing in respect of obligations of the Borrower to such Lender that do not arise under or in connection with the Credit Documents, (x) any payment made in respect of an obligation that is secured by a Permitted Encumbrance or that is otherwise entitled to priority over the Borrower’s Obligations under or in connection with the Credit Documents, (y) any reduction arising from an amount owing to a Loan Party upon the termination of derivatives entered into between the Loan Party and such Lender, or (z) any payment to which such Lender is entitled as a result of any form of credit protection obtained by such Lender.(2)The Loan Parties consent to the foregoing and agree, to the extent they may effectively do so under Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim and similar rights of Lenders with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Loan Party in the amount of such participation.ARTICLE 11 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT’S CLAWBACKSection 11.01Administrative Agent’s Claw back(1)Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any advance of funds that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such advance, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement concerning funding by Lenders and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable advance available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the - 100 -date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with prevailing banking industry practice on interbank compensation. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Accommodation included in such advance. If the Lender does not do so forthwith, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on written demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon at the interest rate applicable to the advance in question. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that has failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.(2)Payments by Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute the amount due to the Lenders. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with prevailing banking industry practice on interbank compensation.ARTICLE 12 AGENCYSection 12.01Appointment and Authority(1)(a)    Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Credit Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and such Domestic Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the Guaranteed Obligations of such Domestic Guarantor under this Guarantee at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guaranteed Obligations of such Domestic Guarantor under this guarantee constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.Each Domestic Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that in the event any payment shall be required to be made to any Lender under this Guarantee or any other guarantee, such Domestic Guarantor will contribute, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, such amounts to each other Domestic Guarantor and each other guarantor so as to maximize the aggregate amount paid to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of the Credit Documents.Section 21.02Indemnity.In addition to the guarantee specified in Section 21.01, each Domestic Guarantor agrees to, jointly and severally, indemnify and save each Guaranteed Party harmless from and against all costs, losses, expenses and damages it may suffer as a result or consequence of the Borrower’s default in the performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any of the Guaranteed Obligations being or becoming void, voidable or unenforceable or ineffective against the Borrower, or any inability by any Guaranteed Party to recover the ultimate balance due or remaining unpaid to such Guaranteed Party in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, including without limitation, reasonable legal fees incurred by or on behalf of any Guaranteed Party resulting from any action instituted on the basis of this Guarantee, provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Guaranteed Party, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final non-appealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Guaranteed Party.Section 21.03Payment and Performance.(1)If the Borrower fails or refuses to punctually make any payment or perform its Guaranteed Obligations, each Domestic Guarantor shall unconditionally render any such payment or performance upon demand in accordance with the terms of this Guarantee.- 131 -(2)Nothing but payment and satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations shall release any Domestic Guarantor from its obligations under this Guarantee, except for the disposition of such Domestic Guarantor in a transaction permitted by this Agreement.Section 21.04Continuing Obligation.The only condition (and no other document, proof or action other than as specifically provided in this Guarantee is) necessary as a condition of each Domestic Guarantor honouring its obligations under this Guarantee shall be a written demand by the Administrative Agent following the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. This Guarantee shall be a continuing guarantee, shall cover all the Guaranteed Obligations, and shall apply to and secure any ultimate balance due or remaining unpaid to any Guaranteed Party. This Guarantee shall continue to be binding regardless of:(1)whether any other Person or Persons (an “Additional Guarantor”) shall become in any other way responsible to any Guaranteed Party for, or in respect of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations;(2)whether any such Additional Guarantor shall cease to be so liable;(3)the enforceability, validity, perfection or effect of perfection or non-perfection of any security interest securing the Guaranteed Obligations, or the validity or enforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; or(4)whether any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations has been made and where such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be returned upon the occurrence of any action or event, including the insolvency or bankruptcy of any Loan Party or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.Section 21.05Guarantee Unaffected.This Guarantee shall not be determined or affected, or the Guaranteed Parties’ rights under this Guarantee prejudiced by, the termination of any Guaranteed Obligations by operation of law or otherwise, including without limitation, the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of any Loan Party, any change in the name, business, powers, capital structure, constitution, objects, organization, directors or management of any Loan Party, with respect to transactions occurring either before or after such change. This Guarantee is to extend to the liabilities of the Person or Persons for the time being and from time to time carrying on the business now carried on by any Loan Party, notwithstanding any reorganization of any Loan Party or any Additional Guarantor or the amalgamation of any Loan Party or any Additional Guarantor with one or more other corporations (in this case, this Guarantee shall extend to the liabilities of the resulting corporation and the terms “Domestic Guarantor”, and “Additional Guarantor” shall include such resulting corporation) or any sale or disposal of any Loan Party’s or the Additional Guarantor’s business in whole or in part to one or more other Persons and all of such liabilities shall be included in the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Domestic Guarantor agrees that the manner in which the Guaranteed Parties may now or subsequently deal with any other Loan Party or any Additional Guarantor or any security (or any collateral subject to the security) or other guarantee in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations - 132 -shall have no effect on any Domestic Guarantor’s continuing liability under this Guarantee and such Domestic Guarantor irrevocably waives any rights it may have in respect of any of the above.Section 21.06Waivers.Each Domestic Guarantor waives each of the following, to the fullest extent permitted by Law:(1)any defence based upon:(a)the unenforceability or invalidity of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any security or other guarantee for the Guaranteed Obligations or any failure of any Guaranteed Party to take proper care or act in a commercially reasonable manner in respect of any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or any collateral subject to the security, including in respect of any disposition of the Collateral or any set-off of any Loan Party’s bank deposits against the Guaranteed Obligations;(b)any act or omission of a Loan Party or any other Person, including the Guaranteed Parties, that directly or indirectly results in the discharge or release of a Loan Party or any other Person or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for the Guaranteed Obligations; or(c)any Guaranteed Party’s present or future method of dealing with any Loan Party, any Additional Guarantor or any security (or any collateral subject to the security) or other guarantee for the Guaranteed Obligations;(2)any right (whether now or hereafter existing) to require any Guaranteed Party, as a condition to the enforcement of this Guarantee including, without limitation, any indemnity provided for herein:(a)to accelerate any of the Guaranteed Obligations or proceed and exhaust any recourse against a Loan Party or any other Person;(b)to realize on any security that it holds;(c)to marshall the assets of such Domestic Guarantor or any other Loan Party; or(d)to pursue any other remedy that such Domestic Guarantor may not be able to pursue itself and that might limit or reduce such Domestic Guarantor’s burden;(3)presentment, demand, protest and notice of any kind including, without limitation, notices of default and notice of acceptance of this Guarantee;(4)all suretyship defences and rights of every nature otherwise available under Ontario law and the laws of any other jurisdiction; and- 133 -(5)all other rights and defences (legal or equitable) the assertion or exercise of which would in any way diminish the liability of such Domestic Guarantor under this Guarantee.Section 21.07Guaranteed Parties’ Right to Act.Each Guaranteed Party has the right to deal with any Domestic Guarantor, the documents creating or evidencing the Guaranteed Obligations and the security (or any collateral subject to the security) now or subsequently held by any Guaranteed Party (including without limitation, all modifications, extensions, replacements, amendments, renewals, restatements, and supplements to such documents or security) as such Guaranteed Party may see fit, without notice to any Domestic Guarantor or any Additional Guarantor and without in any way affecting, relieving, limiting or lessening such Domestic Guarantor’s or any Additional Guarantor’s liability under this Guarantee.

It is not intended to be a definitive statement of all of the terms and conditions of an Auction, the definitive terms and conditions for which shall be set forth in the applicable auction procedures set for each Auction (the “Offer Documents”). None of the Administrative Agent, the Auction Manager and any other Agent, or any of their respective Affiliates, makes any recommendation pursuant to the Offer Documents as to whether or not any Term Loan Lender should sell its Term Loans to the Borrower pursuant to the Offer Documents, nor shall the decision by the Administrative Agent, the Auction Manager or any other Agent (or any of their Affiliates) in its capacity as a Term Loan Lender be deemed to constitute such a recommendation. Each Term Loan Lender should make its own decision as to whether to sell any of its Term Loans and, if it decides to do so, the principal amount of, and price to be sought for, such Term Loans. In addition, each Term Loan Lender should consult its own attorney, business advisor or tax advisor as to legal, business, tax and related matters concerning any Auction and the Offer Documents. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Schedule have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.Summary. The Borrower may conduct one or more Auction pursuant to the procedures described herein.Notice Procedures. In connection with each Auction, the Borrower will provide notification (an “Auction Notice”) to the Auction Manager (for distribution to the Term Loan Lenders). Each Auction Notice shall contain (i) the maximum principal amount of Term Loans that the Borrower is willing to purchase in such Auction (the “Auction Amount”), which shall be no less than $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; (ii) the range of discounts to par (the “Discount Range”), expressed as a range of prices per $1,000, at which the Borrower would be willing to purchase Term Loans in such Auction; and (iii) the date on which such Auction will conclude, on which date Return Bids (as defined below) will be due at the time provided in the Auction Notice (such time, the “Expiration Time”), as such date and time may be extended for a period not exceeding three Business Days upon notice by the Borrower to the Auction Manager received not less than 24 hours before the original Expiration Time.Reply Procedures. In connection with any Auction, each Term Loan Lender holding Term Loans wishing to participate in such Auction shall, prior to the Expiration Time, shall provide the Auction Manager a notice of participation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Auction Manager which shall specify (i) a discount to par expressed as a price per $1,000 of Term Loans (the “Reply Price”) within the Discount Range and (ii) the principal amount of Term Loans, in an amount not less than $1,000,000 or an integral multiple in excess thereof, that such Term Loan Lender is willing to offer for sale at its Reply Price (the “Reply Amount”); provided, that a Term Loan Lender may submit a Reply Amount that is less than the minimum amount and/or incremental amount requirements described above only if the Reply Amount comprises the entire amount of Term Loans held by such Term Loan Lender. Term Loan Lenders may only submit one Return Bid per Auction but each Return Bid may contain up to three component bids, each of which may result in a separate Qualifying Bid (as defined below) and each of which will not be contingent on any other component bid submitted by such Term Loan Lender resulting in a Qualifying Bid. In addition to the Return Bid, each participating Term Loan Lender must execute and deliver to the Auction Manager, an assignment and acceptance Agreement in the form included in the Offer Documents which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Auction Manager and the Administrative Agent (“Affiliate Assignment Agreement”). The Borrower will not purchase any Term Loans at a price that is outside of the applicable Discount Range, nor will any Return Bids (including any component bids specified therein) submitted at a price that is outside such applicable Discount Range be considered in any calculation of the Applicable Threshold Price (as defined below).Acceptance Procedures. Based on the Reply Prices and Reply Amounts received by the Auction Manager, the Auction Manager, in consultation with the Borrower, will calculate the lowest purchase price (the “Applicable Threshold Price”) for the applicable Auction within the Discount Range for such Auction that will allow the Borrower to complete such Auction by purchasing the full Auction Amount (or such lesser amount of Term Loans for which the Borrower has received Qualifying Bids (as defined below)). The Borrower shall purchase Term Loans from each Term Loan Lender whose Return Bid is within the Discount Range and contains a Reply Price that is equal to or less than the Applicable Threshold Price (each, a “Qualifying Bid”). All Term Loans included in Qualifying Bids (including multiple component Qualifying Bids contained in a single Return Bid) received at a Reply Price lower than the Applicable Threshold Price will be purchased at the applicable Reply Price and shall not be subject to proration.Proration Procedures. All Term Loans offered in Return Bids (or, if applicable, any component bid thereof) constituting Qualifying Bids at the Applicable Threshold Price will be purchased at the Applicable Threshold Price; provided that if the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans for which Qualifying Bids have been submitted in any given Auction at the Applicable Threshold Price would exceed the remaining portion of the Auction Amount (after deducting all Term Loans to be purchased below the Applicable Threshold Price), the Borrower shall purchase the Term Loans for which the Qualifying Bids submitted were at the Applicable Threshold Price ratably based on the respective principal amounts offered and in an aggregate amount equal to the amount necessary to complete the purchase of the Auction Amount. No Return Bids (or any component thereof) will be accepted above the Applicable Threshold Price.Notification Procedures. The Auction Manager will calculate and post the Applicable Threshold Price no later than the next Business Day after the date that the Return Bids were due. The Auction Manager will insert the principal amount of Term Loans to be assigned and the applicable settlement date into each applicable Affiliate Assignment Agreement received in connection with a Qualifying Bid. Upon written request of the submitting Term Loan Lender, the Auction Manager will promptly return any Affiliate Assignment Agreement received in connection with a Return Bid that is not a Qualifying Bid.Additional Procedures. Once initiated by an Auction Notice, the Borrower may withdraw an Auction by written notice to the Auction Manager no later than 24 hours before the original Expiration Time so long as, as of such time, no Qualifying Bid has been received by the Auction Manager. Any Return Bid (including any component bid thereof) delivered to the Auction Manager may not be modified, revoked, terminated or cancelled by a Term Loan Lender; provided that a Term Loan Lender may modify a Return Bid at any time prior to the Expiration Time solely to reduce the Reply Price included in such Return Bid. However, an Auction shall become void if the Borrower fails to satisfy one or more of the conditions to purchase Term Loans set forth in, or otherwise comply with the provisions of, Section 15.01(3) of the Credit Agreement. The purchase price for each purchase of Term Loans shall be paid in cash by the Borrower directly to the respective assigning Term Loan Lender on a settlement date as determined by the Auction Manager in consultation with the Borrower (which shall be no later than ten Business Days after the date Return Bids are due). The Borrower shall execute each applicable Affiliate Assignment Agreement received in connection with a Qualifying Bid.All questions as to the form of documents and validity and eligibility of Term Loans that are the subject of an Auction will be determined by the Auction Manager, in consultation with the Borrower, which determination will be final and binding. The Auction Manager’s interpretation of the terms and conditions of the Offer Document, in consultation with the Borrower, will be final and binding.None of the Administrative Agent, the Auction Manager, any other Agent or any of their respective Affiliates assumes any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information concerning the Borrower, the Loan Parties, or any of their Affiliates (whether contained in the Offer Documents or otherwise) or for any failure to disclose events that may have occurred and may affect the significance or accuracy of such information.The Auction Manager acting in its capacity as such under an Auction shall be entitled to the benefits of the provisions of Article 12 and Section 14.01 of the Credit Agreement to the same extent as if each reference therein to the “Administrative Agent” were a reference to the Auction Manager, each reference therein to the “Credit Documents” were a reference to the Offer Documents, the Auction Notice and Affiliate Assignment Agreement and each reference therein to the “Transactions” were a reference to the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Administrative Agent shall cooperate with the Auction Manager as reasonably requested by the Auction Manager in order to enable it to perform its responsibilities and duties in connection with each Auction.This Schedule 9 shall not require the Borrower to initiate any Auction nor shall any Term Loan Lender be obligated to participate in any Auction.
